PMC2467291	A01004	Among the abundant proteins secreted by cercariae was the cercarial protease that has been implicated in degradation of host proteins, secreted proteins proposed to mediate immune invasion by larvae, and proteins implicated in protection of parasites against oxidative stress.
PMC2467291	A01009	There were, however, abundant immunoglobulins, complement factors, and serine protease inhibitors in skin.
PMC2467291	A02003	Abundant immunoglobulins, complement factors, and serine protease inhibitors in skin form a biochemical barrier that complements the structural barrier of the epidermis, basement membrane, and dermis.
PMC2467291	A02004	The fragmentation of some of these host proteins suggests that breaching of host defenses by cercariae includes specific degradation of immunoglobulins and complement, and either degradation of, or overwhelming the host protease inhibitor repertoire.
PMC2467291	A03007	The fragmentation of some of these host proteins suggests that breaching of host defenses by cercariae includes specific degradation of immune response proteins and overwhelming the host protease inhibitor repertoire.
PMC2467291	D00005	The resolution of mass spectrometry following tryptic digest may also not identify peptide fragments generated from host proteins that are targets for cercarial protease, or other protease activity.
PMC2467291	D01002	Previous studies have implicated a small gene family of closely related serine proteases, called cercarial elastase, in facilitating this invasion in one species of schistosome, S. mansoni[13],[14].
PMC2467291	D01004	Cercarial elastase was identified as a major component of acetabular gland secretions by proteomic analyses of artificially activated cercariae [11],[12].
PMC2467291	D01005	This present analysis of proteins detected during cercarial invasion of recently harvested human skin confirms that this protease is a major secretory product released during skin invasion.
PMC2467291	D01006	Most of the peptides detected as cercarial elastase were in the range of 26 to 37 kDa on a one-dimensional SDS-PAGE.
PMC2467291	D01008	However, peptides were also detected in the 15 to 19-kDa range, consistent with a known autocatalytic product of cercarial elastase turnover identified in biochemical studies as 17 kDa [31].
PMC2467291	D01009	Cercarial elastase peptides were also found at 64 kDa in early invasion, along with alpha-1-antitrypsin peptides, suggesting the formation of a complex.
PMC2467291	D02005	Among these latter proteins are the cercarial elastase itself, which may degrade host immunoglobulins [35], as well as SPO-1, T-cell stimulating antigen (11 kD) and paramyosin.
PMC2467291	D03001	The so-called “pre-acetabular glands” are known to contain high concentrations of calcium, the exact function of which unknown, although it was proposed that a high calcium concentrations might serve as post-translational regulation of protease activity [36].
PMC2467291	D04000	At the later (120 min) stage of invasion, cercariae released enzymes implicated in protection against oxidative stress, including GST-26, thioredoxin peroxidase and superoxide dismutase [21],[37],[38].
PMC2467291	D07002	Caspase 14 was detected in skin invaded by cercariae, suggesting that not only was there epidermal cell lysis, but also that apoptotic pathways were induced during cercarial invasion.
PMC2467291	D07006	Gelsolin, an 81 kDa native protein, has a 41 kDa fragment associated with caspase 3 degradation during apoptosis [41].
PMC2467291	D07009	Previous work had identified apoptotic cells in naïve mouse skin exposed to cercariae, as well as increases in caspase-3, but the earliest time point sampled in that study was 8 hours post-exposure [42].
PMC2467291	D08001	Numerous peptides were identified for the protease inhibitors α-1 antitrypsin, α-1 anti-chymotrypsin, and antithrombin, as well as other major serum proteins (Table 2).
PMC2467291	D08011	This may either indicate an activation of the C3 pathway in response to invading cercariae, or degradation of C3 components by cercarial proteases as a mechanism of immune evasion.
PMC2467291	D09001	C1 inhibitor may therefore represent a major target for cercarial proteases.
PMC2467291	D10000	Finally, it was noteworthy that α-1-antitrypsin and elastase were present in higher molecular weight forms in the same gel slice, consistent with a complex between this inhibitor and the cercarial elastase.
PMC2467291	D10001	In vitro studies had shown that α-1-antitrypsin was indeed a potent cercarial elastase inhibitor [31].

PMC2467291	I03002	In contrast, uninduced free swimming cercaria release relatively small number of non-acetabular gland proteins including enolase, GST-28, and actin 2
PMC2467291	I03004	The major secreted proteins include a gene family of histolytic serine proteases that likely facilitate degradation of host tissue barriers, and factors that may contribute to immune evasion
PMC2467291	I04003	The results also provide for the first time a glimpse at host-parasite interactions involving host-derived protease inhibitors and complement-mediated responses to invading larvae.
PMC2467291	M04001	Five-micron sections of human skin invaded by cercariae were processed and stained using the Apop Tag Peroxidase
PMC2467291	R00003	These included the cercarial elastase (aka cercarial protease) isoforms 2a, 1a and 1b.
PMC2467291	R00004	This is the serine protease implicated in degradation of host tissue barriers [14].
PMC2467291	R00005	A schistosome serpin (serine protease inhibitor) was also identified and corresponds to that previously reported in cercarial secretions released into media in vitro [11].
PMC2467291	R01000	Two schistosome-specific proteins, Sm20.8 and Sm21.7, previously reported to be components of the schistosome surface or subjacent tegument [19],[20], and two glutathione-S-transferases, GST 26 and GST 28, were released from the parasite.
PMC2467291	R01001	Finally, a group of schistosome glycolytic enzymes and kinases, known to be abundant in the cytoplasm of larval gland cells were identified.
PMC2467291	R01002	These are presumbably released as holosecretion from the acetabular cells [11],[12] and included glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate-dehydrogenase, glycerol phosphorylase, triose phosphate isomerase, fructose-1-6 adolase, cytosolic ATP-guanidine kinase, and enolase.
PMC2467291	R02000	At two hours post invasion, many larval proteins increased in abundance including GST 28, GST 26, the elastase isoforms, and the glycolytic enzymes.
PMC2467291	R02001	New proteins were detected at 120 minutes, notably schistosome-derived thioredoxin, thioredoxin peroxidase and superoxide dismutase [21].
PMC2467291	R04005	Proteins such as host cystatin and aspartyl protease precursor, may also derive from sweat glands in the skin [25].
PMC2467291	R04006	There were many serum proteins, including immunoglobulins, apolipoprotein, haptoglobin, alpha-2 macroglobulin, complement C4, C3, and C2b (the complement protease fragment), and fibrinogens (alpha, beta, and gamma).
PMC2467291	R06000	There was a striking accumulation of host serine protease inhibitors (serpins) in both control and experimental skin samples.

PMC2614615	I05002	Moreover, reconstitution could be accomplished when discoidal ApoA-I was incubated in the presence of lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase and LDL.
PMC2614615	I05010	(34) using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) found that apoA-I in spherical particles, prepared with the lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase method, had reduced intermolecular interactions and a more variable conformation.
PMC2614615	I09003	In reconstitution studies, the mixing in vitro of two discoidal complexes, one containing apoA-I and the other apoA-II, in the presence of lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase generated, via a fusion process, a spherical HDL in which the apoA-I/apoA-II molar ratio was 0.7:1, a range consistent with that seen in native HDL (50).
PMC2614615	I10005	In 1979 a synthetic amphipathic helical docosapeptide was shown to have similar surface properties to that of apoA-I (58) and to activate lecithin-cholesterol acyl transferase (59).
PMC2614615	I10006	Currently, the most extensively studied among the apoA-I mimetics has been peptide D-4F composed of 18 d-amino acids designed to resist degradation by the intestinal peptidases and also permitting administration by the oral route (60).
PMC2614615	I10009	From the mechanistic viewpoint, in the apo E-null mouse model, D-4F was found to cause a redistribution of apoA-I from α migrating to small size (7 to 8 nm) pre-β migrating HDL enriched in active paraoxonase (62), probably via combined displacement and remodeling processes.
PMC2614615	I11002	Second, this association causes HDL remodeling and the formation of small pre-β migrating particles containing apoA-I, but not apoA-II, enriched in paraoxonase, thus having antiinflammatory and antiatherogenic properties.
PMC2614615	I11004	Also, as a consequence of remodeling, the mature HDL, by losing some of its apoA-I component becomes enriched in apoA-II and impoverished in paraoxonase given the antagonistic action of apoA-II for this enzyme.
PMC2614615	I12003	This view is further corroborated by recent observations in mice in which an increased expression of apoA-II caused an acute inhibitory effect on the hydrolysis of VLDL and chylomicron triglycerides, which suggests that in acquiring apoA-II from circulating HDL that acts as a reservoir, triglyceride-rich particles become a poor substrate for lipoprotein lipase (66).
PMC2614615	I13001	What is emerging is that the HDL proteome contains, in addition to the previously recognized quantitatively “minor” apolipoproteins, enzymes, and transport proteins relevant to lipid metabolism and many others that are not in the lipid area but are involved in the processes of acute-phase response, proteinase inhibition, and complement regulation.
PMC2614615	I14002	The discovery in HDL of a soluble phospholipase A2 was followed by the identification of phospholipid lysoderivatives (75,76,77).
PMC2614615	I15001	Sphingosine kinase, the enzyme that phosphorylates sphingosine to produce S1P, is expressed in platelets (79) as well as in a variety of peripheral blood cells, including erythrocytes, neutrophils, and mononuclear cells (80).
PMC2614615	I15003	Of note, erythrocytes cannot produce sphingosine and also display relatively low levels of sphingosine kinase activity (84).
PMC2614615	I15004	In addition, they efficiently convert exogenous sphingosine to S1P. The fact that erythrocytes lack S1P-degrading enzymes (e.g., sphingosine lyase and S1P phosphatase) permits them to accumulate large amounts of S1P (84, 85).

PMC2687076	D02002	It is currently unclear how genetic variation at these loci modulate height, but there is a precedent for a connection between regulation of chromatin structure and stature: Sotos syndrome (MIM117550), characterized by extreme tall stature, is caused by mutations and deletions in the histone methyltransferase gene NSD1.
PMC2687076	D03002	When we examined our list of 12 height loci, we were somewhat surprised to find three additional previously described targets of let-7: the cell cycle regulator CDK6 (ref. 26), the histone methyltransferase DOT1L​27 and the gene LIN28B​28.
PMC2687076	D04001	A SNP 28 kb upstream of PRKG2 (rs1662845), which encodes the cGMP-dependent protein kinase II (cGKII), showed strong association with height in our meta-analysis of GWA scans (P = 5.7 × 10-5), and in the same direction in the European American height panel (P = 8.5 × 10-6) and the FUSION stage 2 sample (P = 0.001), but not in the FINRISK97 (P = 0.93, opposite direction) and PPP (P = 0.16, opposite direction) panels.

PMC2764366	A01000	In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants influencing LDL-C in an isolated population from Kosrae, we observed associations for SNPs in the gene encoding HMG-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase).
PMC2764366	A01002	We followed up the association results and identified a functional SNP in intron13 (rs3846662), which was in linkage disequilibrium with the SNPs of genome-wide significance and affected alternative splicing of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA.
PMC2764366	A01003	In vitro studies in human lymphoblastoid cells demonstrated that homozygosity for the rs3846662 minor allele was associated with up to 2.2-fold lower expression of alternatively spliced HMG-CoA reductase mRNA lacking exon13 and minigene transfection assays confirmed that allele status at rs3846662 directly modulated alternative splicing of HMG-CoA reductase exon13 (42.9±3.9 vs. 63.7±1.0 %Δexon13/total HMGCR mRNA, p=0.02).
PMC2764366	A01004	Further, the alternative splice variant could not restore HMG-CoA reductase activity when expressed in HMG-CoA reductase deficient UT-2 cells.

PMC2764366	D00000	We identified variants in the HMG-CoA reductase gene that were among our top hits for LDL-C in a GWAS in a population from the Island of Kosrae.
PMC2764366	D00001	We then conducted in vitro studies to follow-up the association signals and to identify a functional variant at the HMG-CoA reductase locus.
PMC2764366	D00002	We present evidence that a common intronic SNP (rs384662) that is in linkage disequilibrium with the variants typed in the genome scan modulates alternative splicing of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA.
PMC2764366	D00003	The resulting splice variant could not restore enzyme activity when expressed in HMG-CoA reductase deficient UT-2 cells.
PMC2764366	D01000	HMG-CoA reductase is a key enzyme in cholesterol homeostasis and catalyzes the rate limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis 21.
PMC2764366	D01001	In contrast to other well known determinants of cholesterol homeostasis, e.g. LDL-receptor or Apolipoprotein E, associations between variants in HMG-CoA reductase and LDL-C have only recently emerged in the context of GWAS.
PMC2764366	D01002	As in the Kosrae study, the initial results of the DGI GWAS in 2758 Caucasians supported associations between SNPs in HMG-CoA reductase and LDL-C, but did not meet the statistical threshold of genome-wide significance by themselves (best associated SNP rs12654264: p=4.09×10−4) 13.
PMC2764366	D01003	In this study, genome-wide significance was clearly established for HMG-CoA reductase SNP rs12654264 after validation in three additional Caucasian cohorts, resulting in a combined p-value of 1×10−20 in a total of ~18000 subjects 13.
PMC2764366	D01004	However in a separate study, the associations between SNPs in HMG-CoA reductase and LDL-C that were observed in the DGI study were not strengthened by a meta analysis approach, consisting of the DGI and two other Caucasian GWAS (best associated SNP rs3846663: p=2.79×10−4 ) 12.
PMC2764366	D01006	Combining the association results from the Kosrae and DGI studies revealed three variants in LD (r2>0.81) with genome-wide significance at the HMG-CoA reductase locus, including the two SNPs mentioned above (rs12654264, rs3846663) and SNP rs7703051.
PMC2764366	D01007	Our data obtained in the Kosrae isolate thereby adds important evidence about the generalizibility of genetic associations at the HMG-CoA reductase locus, demonstrating that these associations also extend to other ancestries.
PMC2764366	D01008	Interestingly, two pharmacogenetic studies investigating if genetic variants in HMG-CoA reductase influence response to statin therapy demonstrated that common SNP haplotypes in HMG-CoA reductase contribute to variation in statin response 24, 25.
PMC2764366	D02000	A major aspect of our study was to follow-up the findings from the GWAS and to identify the putative functional variant at the HMG-CoA reductase locus.
PMC2764366	D02002	Our efforts were facilitated by a near complete inventory (99%) of all common (>5% minor allele frequency) regional sequence variations, resulting from resequencing of the complete HMG-CoA reductase locus in 23 Caucasians 19.
PMC2764366	D02003	Since the only known common coding SNP in HMG-CoA reductase (rs5908, I638V) is not in LD with any of the genotyped SNPs, we consider it to be unlikely that this variant is responsible for the association signal.
PMC2764366	D02004	Likewise, since we did not detect significant differences in total HMG-CoA reductase mRNA expression, we consider it to be unlikely that the causal SNP is located in a regulatory element affecting HMG-CoA reductase transcription.
PMC2764366	D02005	On the other hand, we provide mutually supportive evidence that a common intronic variant (rs3846662) in LD with the genotyped variants is functional and alters the efficiency of HMG-CoA reductase exon13 alternative splicing: We could demonstrate that (1.) expression levels of alternatively spliced Δexon13 HMG-CoA reductase mRNA were significantly lower in lymphoblastoid cells from homozygotes for the rs3846662 minor allele and (2.) allele status at rs3846662 directly modulated alternative splicing of HMGCR mRNA in minigene constructs.
PMC2764366	D02006	Further, alternative splicing of HMG-CoA reductase appeared to be regulated and was present in vivo, as we could detect Δexon13 HMG-CoA reductase mRNA in all eleven human tissues that we studied.
PMC2764366	D03000	HMG-CoA reductase mRNA lacking exon13 was described in a survey of alternative pre-mRNA splicing by Johnson et al 20, however its function and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.
PMC2764366	D03002	The most likely explanation for the observed differences in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA splicing between major and minor allele homozygotes at rs3846662 is that this SNP is located in a binding motif for a splice auxiliary protein and allele status changes the binding affinity of this protein.
PMC2764366	D03003	Homozygosity for the major allele at rs3846662 increased the proportion of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA lacking exon13.
PMC2764366	D03005	When we stably expressed both HMG-CoA reductase variants in CHO cells deficient of endogenous HMG-CoA reductase activity, the Δexon13 variant appeared to be non-functional and was not able to restore cell growth in the absence of mevalonate.
PMC2764366	D03008	Thus, deletion of exon13 could potentially impact the stability of the enzyme, since experiments in which monomeric soluble proteins were fused to the HMG-CoA reductase membrane domains illustrated that the protein was degraded faster when it was smaller than tetrameric 30.
PMC2764366	D03010	Therefore, alternative splicing of HMG-CoA reductase appears to result in altered enzymatic activity and could also lead to more rapid degradation of the protein.
PMC2764366	D03011	A decrease in HMG-CoA reductase activity would lead to lower cellular cholesterol synthesis and subsequently a counter-regulatory increase of cholesterol uptake from the plasma via the LDL-receptor pathway to maintain intracellular cholesterol homeostasis.
PMC2764366	D03012	In accordance with this hypothesis the allele at rs3846662 that was causing higher levels of Δexon13 HMG-CoA reductase mRNA in our in vitro studies was sharing a haplotype with the alleles that were associated with lower LDL-C in the genome-wide association studies.
PMC2764366	D03013	HMG-CoA reductase activity is subject to multivalent control on transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels and alternative splicing may be an additional regulatory mechanism.
PMC2764366	D04000	Modulation of alternatively spliced HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels could be of pharmacologic interest with regard to response to statin therapy or as target for antisense-mediated exon skipping.
PMC2764366	D05000	Therefore, identification of specific factors that regulate HMG-CoA reductase alternative splicing and elucidating the underlying mechanism may lead to a better understanding of its impact on regulating cellular cholesterol homeostasis and plasma cholesterol levels.

PMC2764366	I02004	During the preparation of this manuscript, four GWAS for LDL-C in Caucasian cohorts were published 10–13 and one of them 13 included an association between the same SNPs in HMG-CoA reductase and plasma LDL-C in Caucasians.
PMC2764366	I04000	In this manuscript, we report associations of SNPs in HMG-CoA reductase with LDL-C in Kosraens that, in combination with similar findings from studies in Caucasians, indicate that the same genetic variants at HMG-CoA reductase contribute to differences in LDL-C across populations.

PMC2764366	R00003	The second best locus for LDL-C mapped to a region on chromosome 5q13 containing the HMG-CoA reductase gene (Table1).
PMC2764366	R00004	This gene encodes HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis and thus represents an interesting candidate gene with high plausibility.
PMC2764366	R02000	Combining p-values across both studies, we validated multiple SNPs at the HMG-CoA reductase locus, three of which surpassed a genome-wide significance of p<5 ×10−8 (rs7703051, rs12654264 and rs3846663) (Table 1 and supplemental Fig.II).
PMC2764366	R02001	A regional association plot for the combined results showed a peak of association signal over a 47 kb region containing the HMG-CoA reductase gene (Fig.II).
PMC2764366	R03000	We also combined the p-values of the association analysis results for plasma total cholesterol from the Kosrae and DGI studies and found genome-wide significance for the same three SNPs at the HMG-CoA reductase locus (supplemental Table I).
PMC2764366	R04000	To follow-up the association results, we next aimed to discover functional variants at the HMG-CoA reductase locus and study their molecular mode of action.
PMC2764366	R04001	We used existing resequencing data of the region containing the entire HMG-CoA reductase gene from 23 Caucasians - estimated to have >99% power to detect variants with a minor allele frequency of >5% 19- to identify candidate functional SNPs.
PMC2764366	R04002	Under our hypothesis driven model we focused on SNPs that would have strong potential for changing HMG-CoA reductase function or levels.
PMC2764366	R05001	The lack of LD (r2≤0.02) between these SNPs and the only known non-synonymous SNP in HMG-CoA reductase, rs5908 (I638V) in exon15, suggested that the association was not due to this protein coding mutation (Fig.1).
PMC2764366	R05002	Since the existence of a second HMG-CoA reductase mRNA transcript resulting from alternative splicing had been reported in humans 20, we looked for SNPs in the vicinity of exon-intron borders.
PMC2764366	R06000	To analyze whether rs3846662 was associated with HMG-CoA reductase splicing efficiency we obtained lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from Caucasian CEU individuals of the HapMap collection, who were either homozygous for the major (rs3846662/AA) or minor allele (rs3846662/GG).
PMC2764366	R06003	We first analyzed if total HMG-CoA reductase mRNA expression differed between both groups.
PMC2764366	R06004	As shown in Fig.2A, we did not detect significant differences in total HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels between the two groups at any time point, indicating that total HMG-CoA reductase mRNA expression is not influenced by allele status at these SNPs.
PMC2764366	R07000	We went on to determine the amounts of full-length and alternatively spliced HMG-CoA reductase (Δexon13) mRNA separately.
PMC2764366	R07001	Δexon13 HMG-CoA reductase mRNA was detectable in all samples and showed significant variation along the time course (Fig.2B).
PMC2764366	R07002	We observed a distinct decrease in the percentage of Δexon13 HMG-CoA reductase mRNA in both genotype groups over the first 10h.
PMC2764366	R07003	However, the decrease in percentage of Δexon13 HMG-CoA reductase mRNA was significantly less pronounced in LCLs from homozygotes for the rs3846662 major allele.
PMC2764366	R07004	Hence, the percentage of Δexon13 HMG-CoA reductase mRNA per total HMG-CoA reductase mRNA was significantly higher in homozygotes for the major allele as compared to homozygotes for the minor allele at 10h, 24h and 48h (10h: 23.0±7.6 vs. 10.4±3.4, 24h: 23.1±7.9 vs. 11.6±3.8, 48h: 27.1±9.4 vs. 15.7±9.1, % Δexon13/total HMGCR mRNA, major vs. minor allele, Fig.2B).
PMC2764366	R09000	We next quantified the expression levels of both HMG-CoA reductase transcripts in vivo, using cDNA samples from various human tissues.
PMC2764366	R09002	The percentage of Δexon13 HMG-CoA reductase mRNA per total HMG-CoA reductase mRNA varied between 7 and 18%, with the exception of peripheral blood leukocytes.
PMC2764366	R09003	In peripheral blood leukocytes, Δexon13 HMG-CoA reductase mRNA accounted for 79% of total HMG-CoA reductase mRNA transcripts (Fig.3).
PMC2764366	R10000	Our studies in LCLs demonstrated that the amount of Δexon13 HMG-CoA reductase mRNA was associated with allele status at SNP rs3846662.
PMC2764366	R10002	We created exon-trapping vectors containing the genomic DNA sequence of HMG-CoA reductase from intron12 to intron14 of rs3846662/AA (major allele) and rs3846662/GG (minor allele) individuals, respectively and transfected them into HEK293 cells.
PMC2764366	R11000	In accordance with our previous results in human LCLs, we found significantly lower levels for Δexon13 HMG-CoA reductase mRNA in cells transfected with the minor allele minigene (rs3846662/G) as compared to cells transfected with the major allele minigene (rs3846662/A) (Fig.4).
PMC2764366	R11001	The difference in exon13 splicing efficiency between the two minigenes was 20.8% (42.9±3.9 vs. 63.7±1.0 %Δexon13 HMG-CoA reductase mRNA/total HMG-CoA reductase mRNA, p=0.02).
PMC2764366	R11002	This difference in splicing efficiency was abolished when we transfected a construct in which we had used site directed mutagenesis to convert rs3846662/A to the minor G allele (Fig.4), further corroborating that allelic variants at rs3846662 directly modulate the efficiency of HMG-CoA reductase exon13 splicing.
PMC2764366	R12000	Alternative splicing of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA leads to an in-frame deletion of 53 amino acids in the catalytic domain of the protein.

PMC4915629	A04001	Our results suggest that, since kynurenine monoxygenase diverts the kynurenine pathway toward the synthesis of xanthurenic acid, its inhibition may also contribute to glucose homeostasis.
PMC4915629	D03000	The enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (kynurenine 3-monooxygenase) is located at a critical branching point in the kynurenine pathway such that the inhibition of this enzyme by either pharmacological or genetic means may shift the flux towards the formation of kynurenic acid rather than to the synthesis of xanthurenic acid.
PMC4915629	D03001	The inhibition of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase has suggested that kynurenine 3-monooxygenase regulates the production of downstream KP metabolites.
PMC4915629	D03002	We have previously shown that the adipose tissue expression of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase was associated with higher HbA1c in women with obesity and was expressed preferentially in pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages [7].

PMC5097088	A00005	Validation studies revealed cyclophilin A, annexin A2, and aldolase A mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly higher in cancer regions than in non-cancer regions.
PMC5097088	A00006	Moreover, an in vitro study showed that secretion of aldolase A into the culture medium was clearly suppressed in CRC cells compared to normal colon epithelium.
PMC5097088	A00007	These findings suggest that decreased aldolase A in blood may be a novel biomarker for the early detection of CRC.
PMC5097088	D01002	These criteria led us to select aldolase A, cyclophilin A, and annexin A2 as candidates.
PMC5097088	D03000	Although mRNA and protein expression of aldolase A were detected in all tested cell lines (Fig. ​(Fig.7a7a and d), aldolase A protein was not detected in the culture medium of the three CRC cell lines, while it was clearly detected in the culture medium of normal colon epithelial cells (Fig. ​(Fig.7e).7e).
PMC5097088	D03001	Moreover, aldolase A was detected in normal human serum (Fig.
PMC5097088	D03003	These results suggest that secretion of aldolase A may be suppressed by dysfunction of aldolase A due to accumulated genetic mutations during the carcinogenesis process of CRC.

PMC6531881	A00002	We compared the performance of high fidelity polymerases and various numbers of rounds of amplification when amplifying a mock community and human stool samples.
PMC6531881	A00004	Namely, using a polymerase with the highest possible fidelity and minimizing the number of rounds of PCR reduced the sequencing error rate, fraction of chimeric sequences, and bias.
PMC6531881	A00009	However, the results indicate that the variation in human stool samples is generally larger than that introduced by the choice of polymerase or number of rounds of PCR.
PMC6531881	A01003	We quantified the effects of the choice of polymerase and number of PCR cycles on the quality of downstream data.
PMC6531881	A01005	The effects are relatively small compared to the variation in human stool samples; however, care should be taken to use polymerases with the highest possible fidelity and to minimize the number of rounds of PCR.
PMC6531881	D00000	Our results suggest that the number of rounds of PCR and to a lesser degree the choice of DNA polymerase impact the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data from bacterial communities.
PMC6531881	D01000	The observed sequencing error rates and alpha diversity metrics followed the manufacturers’ measurements of their polymerases’ fidelity (Fig. 1).
PMC6531881	D01002	Among these polymerases, the KAPA polymerase consistently resulted in a lower error rate, lower chimera rate, and lower bias across rounds of PCR for the mock community samples.
PMC6531881	D01003	Furthermore, among the human samples, the KAPA polymerase consistently had the lowest detected chimera rate and intercycle bias.
PMC6531881	D01005	However, in our experience and despite efforts to optimize the yield with the KAPA polymerase, the reactions typically had a high proportion of primer-dimer products and low yield of correctly sized products.
PMC6531881	D01006	Although the error rate with the Accuprime polymerase was not as low as that with KAPA, we consider it to be an acceptable alternative.
PMC6531881	D01007	Considering that polymerase development is an active area of commercial development with potential new polymerases becoming available, it is important for researchers to understand how changing the polymerase impacts downstream analyses for their type of samples.
PMC6531881	D02008	Minimizing the level of DNA shearing, controlling for template concentration across samples, and using the fewest number of rounds of PCR with a polymerase that has the highest possible fidelity are strategies that can be employed to minimize the formation of chimeras.

PMC6531881	I02000	The influence that the choice of DNA polymerase has on the formation of PCR artifacts has not been well studied.
PMC6531881	I02001	There has been recent interest in how the choice of the hypervariable region and data analysis pipeline impact the sequencing error rate (15, 18,–20); however, these studies use the same DNA polymerase in the PCR step and implicitly assume that the rate of nucleotide misincorporation from PCR are significantly smaller than those from the sequencing phase.
PMC6531881	I02003	A recent study found differences in the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and chimeras between normal and high fidelity DNA polymerases (38).
PMC6531881	I02004	The authors of the study reduced the difference between two polymerases by optimizing the annealing and extension steps within the PCR protocol (38).
PMC6531881	I02005	Yet this optimization was specific for the community they were analyzing (i.e., captive and semicaptive red-shanked doucs) and assumed that if the two polymerases generate the same community structure that the community structure was correct.
PMC6531881	I02011	Given the large number of DNA polymerases available to researchers, it is unlikely that a specific recommendation is possible.
PMC6531881	I03000	This study investigated the impact of choice of high fidelity DNA polymerase and the number of rounds of amplification on the formation of PCR artifacts using a mock community and human stool samples.
PMC6531881	I03002	We tested (i) the effect of the polymerase on the error rate of the bases represented in the final sequences, (ii) the fraction of sequences that appeared to be chimeras and the ability to detect those chimeras, (iii) the bias of preferentially amplifying one fragment over another in a mixed pool of templates, and (iv) intersample variation in community structure of samples amplified with the same polymerase across the amplification process.
PMC6531881	I03006	To better understand the impact of DNA polymerase choice on PCR artifacts, we selected five high fidelity DNA polymerases and amplified the communities using 20, 25, 30, and 35 rounds of amplification.
PMC6531881	I03007	Collectively, our results suggest that the number of rounds and to a lesser extent the choice of DNA polymerase used in PCR impact the sequence data.
PMC6531881	M02000	Five high fidelity DNA polymerases were tested, including AccuPrime (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), KAPA HIFI (Roche, IN, USA), Phusion (New England Biolabs, MA, USA), Platinum (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and Q5 (New England Biolabs, MA, USA).
PMC6531881	M03000	Each PCR condition (i.e., combination of polymerase and number of rounds of PCR) was replicated four times for the mock community and one time for each fecal sample.
PMC6531881	R00005	Regardless of the polymerase, the error rate increased with the number of rounds of amplification (Fig. 1).
PMC6531881	R00007	Among the data generated using 30 rounds of PCR, the Accuprime polymerase had the highest error rate (i.e., 0.124%), followed by the Platinum (i.e., 0.094%), Phusion (i.e., 0.064%), KAPA (i.e., 0.062%), and Q5 (i.e., 0.060%) polymerases (Fig. 1).
PMC6531881	R00008	When we applied a preclustering denoising step, which merged the counts of reads within 2 nt of a more abundant sequence (19), the error rates dropped considerably such that the Platinum polymerase had the highest error rate (i.e., 0.014%), followed by the Accuprime (i.e., 0.012%), Q5 (i.e., 0.0053%), Phusion (i.e., 0.0049%), and KAPA (i.e., 0.0049%) polymerases (Fig. 1).
PMC6531881	R00009	Although specific recommendations are difficult to make because the phylogenetic diversity of the initial DNA template is likely to have an impact on the results, it is clear that using as few PCR cycles as necessary and a polymerase with the lowest possible error rate is a good guide to minimizing the impact of polymerase on the error rate.
PMC6531881	R03004	We compared the vendor-reported relative abundance of the 16S rRNA genes from each bacterium in the mock community to the data we generated across rounds of amplification and polymerase (Fig. 3).
PMC6531881	R04000	With the exception of the sequence data generated using the KAPA polymerase, the ratios of the two Salmonella enterica V4 sequences from the mock community were lower than the expected ratio of 6:1.
PMC6531881	R05000	Because the variation in bias between polymerases and across rounds of PCR could be artificially inflated due to sequencing errors and chimeras, we analyzed the alpha and beta diversity of the mock community data at different phases of the sequence curation pipeline (Fig. 4).
PMC6531881	R06001	To study this further, we calculated alpha and beta diversity metrics using the human stool samples for each of the polymerases and rounds of amplification.
PMC6531881	R06004	When we characterized the variation between rounds of amplification using human stool samples, the distance between the 25 and 30 rounds and 25 and 35 rounds varied considerably between samples and polymerases (Fig.
PMC6531881	R07001	To test this, we determined the average Bray-Curtis distance between replicate reactions using the same polymerase and number of rounds of amplification (Fig. 6).
PMC6571926	D02001	In the alimentary canal, unabsorbed EGCG and ECG were hydrolyzed by the esterases in saliva, gastric and pancreatic juices, and microbiota to form EGC and EC, respectively, and release gallic acid [10,11,27,28].
PMC6571926	D03000	Formation of GTP-derived urinary metabolites: Absorbed EGC, either directly from the GTP supplement, or from the hydrolysis of EGCG, likely underwent catechol-O-methyltransferase-mediated methylation followed by uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)-mediated glucuronidation to form methyl epigallocatechin glucuronide (Vu).

PMC6708594	I03002	The goals of these studies were to evaluate the feasibility of quantitating F-ara-ATP accumulation rate after ex vivo fludarabine exposure of CD4+ or CD8+ T-lymphocytes; to quantitate F-ara-ATP accumulation and variability in CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes isolated from healthy volunteers and patients awaiting HCT; and to assess possible mechanisms underlying the interindividual variability by analyzing gene expression levels of transporters (hENT1, hENT2, and hCNT3) and enzymes (deoxycytidine kinase, 5’-nucleotidase, and dNT-1) involved in fludarabine uptake and activation.
PMC6708594	M05004	Gene-specific TaqMan® Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) were used to quantitate gene expression of key transporters and enzymes involved in F-ara-ATP accumulation (see Figure 1): hENT1 (Hs00191940_m1), hENT2 (Hs00155426_m1), hCNT3 (Hs00223220_m1), deoxycytidine kinase (Hs00176127_m1), 5’-nucleotidase (Hs00366992_m1), and dNT-1 (Hs00274359_m1) relative to an internal endogenous control β-glucuronidase (GUS) (4333767F) on a 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).
PMC6708594	M05015	Analysis was performed using the 3 predictors of the two main determinants of F-ara-ATP accumulation: the genes of the uptake transporters pathway (hENT1, hENT2, and hCNT3) and the genes involved in the intracellular formation of F-ara-AMP (deoxycytidine kinase, 5’-nucleotidase, and dNT-1).
PMC6708594	R04000	We then evaluated the mRNA expression levels of the transporters (hENT1, hENT2, hCNT3) and enzymes (deoxycytidine kinase, 5’-nucleotidase, and dNT-1) important in the uptake of fludarabine and subsequent formation of F-ara-ATP (see Figure 1).
PMC6708594	R04002	We observed wide variability in the expression levels of several of the genes, with hCNT3 displaying the highest variability, followed by hENT1 and deoxynucleotidase-1.
PMC6708594	R04003	Less variability was observed in the expression of hENT2, deoxycytidine kinase, and 5’-nucleotidase.
PMC6708594	R04005	The difference in variability between healthy volunteers and HCT was particularly evident in the hENT1, hCNT3, and deoxynucleotidase-1 genes.
PMC6708594	R04008	The mRNA expression of deoxynucleotidase-1 was associated with F-ara-ATP accumulation in CD8+ cells (p < 0.0005), but the slope of the association was very small; therefore, it is unlikely that deoxynucleotidase-1 mRNA expression is a good marker for T-lymphocyte F-ara-ATP accumulation.

PMC6716427	I02000	Several classes of DHA-derived LMs, arising from different lipoxygenases as well as aspirin-inactivated cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), such as resolvins (Serhan et al., 2002), protectins (Marcheselli et al., 2003; Serhan et al., 2011), and maresins (Serhan et al., 2009), and their aspirin-triggered epimers, have been identified as potentially important factors in the resolution phase of the inflammatory reaction (Serhan, 2014).
PMC6716427	R04002	This correction was particularly evident when focusing on 15-HETE and 17OH-DHA, metabolites arising from the same enzymatic activities, namely, 15-LOX or aspirin-inactivated COX-2, on AA and DHA, respectively.

PMC6789025	A00006	Myo-inositol treatment ameliorated the decreased expression of ZO-1 and synaptopodin in an in vitro FSGS model, and as myo-inositol increased, myo-inositol oxygenase tissue expression decreased proportionally to eGFR.
PMC6789025	D00003	Moreover, we investigated the effects of myo-inositol treatment in an in vitro FSGS model, and we found that myo-inositol oxygenase increased in proportion to eGFR in FSGS human kidney tissue, while it was inversely related to urinary myo-inositol.
PMC6789025	D02006	Moreover, Dutta RK et al.22 demonstrated that overexpression of myo-inositol oxygenase promotes degradation of myo-inositol and decreases myo-inositol levels, worsening cisplatin-induced acute kidney injury.
PMC6789025	D02007	These results are consistent with our findings that urinary myo-inositol is increased in FSGS patients with reduced renal function (increased suPAR level) or reduced myo-inositol oxygenase expression and that treatment with myo-inositol in the in vitro FSGS model resulted in an increase in the expression of various markers, which was similar to the attenuation of the disease.

PMC6791832	R10001	Therefore, the acute toxicity of Tem on the nervous system may be mainly attributed to Tem-oxons as a product of the biotransformation after oxidative desulfuration likely catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (cytochrome P450)14, as well as to the exposure of Tem-oxidized metabolites generated under oxidative environmental conditions8 and enhanced by water chlorination9.
PMC6791832	R10002	The in vitro results on the inhibition of human RBC AChE by Tem-oxidized metabolites could help clarify the mechanism of action of Tem in mammals, since all of the latter possess the ability to inhibit AChE.

PMC6815137	I01000	Family-wide chemical proteomic probes are particularly useful because they can report on the activity of large swaths of the active proteome simultaneously, with published examples available for serine hydrolases (6, 7), kinases (8, 9), metalloproteases (10), cysteine proteases (11), and other functionalities that regulate protein activity (12–14).
PMC6815137	R01000	To pilot sADPL, we targeted proteins associated with cancer phenotypes in 2 well-characterized enzyme families, serine hydrolase and cathepsin cysteine protease enzymes, using widely available fluorophosphonate-biotin (FP-Bio) (15) and an acyloxymethylketone-based cathepsin probe (19), respectively.
PMC6815137	R01002	Using monoacylglycerol lipase (MGLL) as a model enzyme, we optimized the absolute and relative concentrations of Ab-oligo and SA-oligo conjugates required for the sADPL signal and dynamic range in whole-cell proteome (SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
PMC6815137	R01003	We then tested the sensitivity and dynamic range of sADPL quantification for diverse protein targets, including the serine hydrolase enzymes neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1), MGLL, fatty acid
PMC6815137	R01004	amide hydrolase 1 (fatty acid amide hydrolase 1), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4), as well as the cysteine protease enzymes cathepsin B (CTSB) and cathepsin L (CTSL).
PMC6815137	R01007	Indeed, side-by-side comparison of sADPL, which by design detects only active protein, and Western blot analysis for neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 confirmed a limit of detection at least 6 orders of magnitude lower for sADPL, which could detect active protein in picogram quantities of whole proteome (Fig. 2 C and D).
PMC6815137	R02002	Each cell line was pulsed with either vehicle control (DMSO) or a combination of serine hydrolase and cathepsin protease probes, followed by sADPL profiling and relative activity quantification of 6 biomarker enzymes (Fig. 2E).
PMC6815137	R02003	neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 and MGLL activities were 12.5- and 13.3-fold higher, respectively, in SKOV3IP1 cells relative to OVCAR3 cells, which matched previous reports using MS-based, gel-based, and imaging-based activity measurements in these cell lines (15, 21, 22).
PMC6815137	R02004	In contrast, fatty acid amide hydrolase 1 activity was approximately 2-fold higher in the nonaggressive OVCAR3 cells relative to SKOV3IP1 cells, consistent with previously published bulk activity-based profiling data in several cancer cell lines (Fig. 2E) (24).
PMC6815137	R02005	Finally, the activity states of both cathepsin enzymes and the peptidase dipeptidyl peptidase-4 were significantly increased in the more aggressive SKOV3IP1 cells (Fig. 2E).
PMC6815137	R03002	Cathepsin abundance and activity ratios between cell lines were almost identical for cathepsin B, but the cathepsin L activity ratio was moderately increased relative to abundance (Fig. 2F).
PMC6815137	R03003	Significant differences were found for neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 and MGLL, with abundance ratios of 37.7-fold and 50.2-fold for each enzyme, respectively, compared with the more modest activity ratios of slightly above 10-fold (Fig. 2F).
PMC6815137	R03004	In contrast, the activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase 1 was 2-fold lower in SKOV3IP1 cells compared with OVCAR3 cells, whereas abundance was nearly 4-fold lower in SKOV3IP1 cells, indicating that a higher percentage of fatty acid amide hydrolase 1 is active in SKOV3IP1 cells relative to OVCAR3 cells.
PMC6815137	R03005	Finally, the correlation between MS-based abundance and activity of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 was highly divergent, with nearly 350-fold higher protein levels observed in SKOV3IP1 cells by LC-MS/MS, contrasted with just a 3.2-fold increase in activity.
PMC6815137	R04000	To further verify the differences observed for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and cathepsin L, we measured their protein levels by Western blot analysis.
PMC6815137	R04001	The dipeptidyl peptidase-4 level was 3.7-fold higher in SKOV3IP1 cells, which closely matched the activity difference measured by sADPL (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
PMC6815137	R04002	The cathepsin L level was 4.1-fold higher in SKOV3IP1 relative to OVCAR3; however, this measurement recognizes both precursors and mature cathepsin L, again supporting a significant difference between activity and abundance (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
PMC6815137	R05001	To test this, we first treated cultured cells with selective small molecule inhibitors of neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (JW480) (28) and fatty acid amide hydrolase 1 (PF3845) (29), followed by FP-Bio probe treatment and sADPL processing.
PMC6815137	R05004	In addition, sADPL detected graded changes in neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 activity levels in response to increased JW480 concentrations, an indication of direct occupancy of this enzyme by its small molecule inhibitor (IC50 = 10.5 nM; Fig. 3C).
PMC6815137	R05005	Parallel quantification of MGLL activity in response to JW480 treatment showed no effect (Fig. 3C), confirming the specificity of each sADPL signal within the serine hydrolase family.
PMC6815137	R06002	In agreement with previously published pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data on JW480 (28), the neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1-dependent sADPL signal was reduced in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3F).
PMC6815137	R06003	Parallel quantification of the activity of fatty acid amide hydrolase 1 and MGLL, 2 related off-target serine hydrolases, showed no significant inhibition of either target at either dose, consistent with previous gel-based profiling in mice treated with JW480 (28).

PMC7005843	M09003	Microorganisms can synthesize siderophores via the non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (non-ribosomal peptide synthetase) or NIS (non-ribosomal peptide synthetase-independent siderophore) pathways (Carroll and Moore, 2018).
PMC7005843	M12000	Heme oxygenase and transport genes define another strategy that microorganisms, especially pathogens, use to obtain iron from their environment.
PMC7005843	M12001	In particular, heme oxygenases enable pathogens to obtain iron from a host through oxidative cleavage of heme, thereby releasing iron (Wilks and Heinzl, 2014).
PMC7005843	M12002	Heme oxygenases are categorized into two groups: (1) “canonical” heme oxygenases (HmuO, PigA, and HemO), which degrade heme to biliverdin and carbon monoxide, and (2) “non-canonical” heme oxygenases (IsdG, IsdI, MhuD, and Isd-LmHde), which degrade heme to products like staphylobilin (IsdG and IsdI) and mycobilin (MhuD) (Wilks and Heinzl, 2014).
PMC7005843	M12003	All these heme oxygenase genes are included in FeGenie’s HMM library.
PMC7005843	R02003	This same operon also encodes a catalase (not included in FeGenie), which is a heme-containing protein that deals with oxidative stress and may potentially be expressed together with the iron-reduction genes to deal with the oxidative stress of high intracellular iron concentrations (Touati, 2000), likely resulting from dissimilatory iron reduction.
PMC7005843	R03001	This gene has been confirmed as an iron-oxidase in Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans (Castelle et al., 2008) and is also encoded by neutrophilic, obligate iron-oxidizers (Barco et al., 2015).
PMC7005843	R03002	We note that only one of these cluster 3-affiliated Cyc2 homologs, Cyt572, has been biochemically characterized and determined to have iron oxidase activity (Jeans et al., 2008).
PMC7005843	R04004	Without any other candidate iron reductases in AMB-1’s genome, this indicates that MtrAB may be utilized in iron reduction without the outer-membrane component.
PMC7005843	R05000	FeGenie was also used to identify iron acquisition and transport genes in model microorganisms, including siderophore transport and synthesis genes, heme transport and oxygenases, and Fe(II)/Fe(III) transport.

PMC7542363	A00001	However, pathogenic, and commensal bacteria have evolved specific glycoproteases that overcome the steric impediment posed by carbohydrates, cleaving glycoproteins precisely at their glycosylation site(s).
PMC7542363	A00002	Medically relevant Acinetobacter strains employ their type II secretion system (T2SS) to secrete the glycoprotease CpaA, which contributes to virulence.
PMC7542363	A00008	Similar bacterial glycoproteases have recently gained attention as tools for proteomic analysis of human glycoproteins, and CpaA appears to be a robust and attractive new component of the glycoproteomics toolbox.
PMC7542363	A00009	Combined, our work provides insight into the function and possible application of CpaA, a member of a widespread class of broad-spectrum bacterial glycoproteases involved in host-pathogen interactions.
PMC7542363	D00002	However, there is growing evidence that bacterial pathogens and commensals have evolved specific proteases that overcome the steric impediment posed by carbohydrates and indeed use glycans as recognition determinants to cleave glycoproteins right at the glycosylation site.
PMC7542363	D00003	In this work, we functionally characterized CpaA, a metzincin glycoprotease and T2SS-secreted virulence factor of several medically relevant Acinetobacter strains (4, 7, 8, 12).
PMC7542363	D00006	Our MS analysis of proteolytic fragments resulting from glycoprotein treatment with CpaA revealed that CpaA has a consensus target sequence consisting of a Pro residue followed by a glycosylated Ser or Thr (P-S/T), which is unprecedented for bacterial glycoproteases.
PMC7542363	D00007	Unlike other secreted glycoproteases, CpaA activity is not affected by sialic acid and is not restricted to highly O-glycosylated proteins (mucins).
PMC7542363	D00009	Although broad-spectrum secreted or surface-exposed glycoproteases appear to be widespread in bacteria, their identification cannot be assigned based on sequence homology, and biochemical and structural analyses are required to designate them as glycoproteases.
PMC7542363	D01006	Considering the different domain organization of the two proteases, it is not surprising that the proteins are classified in different metzincin subfamilies and target different proteins.
PMC7542363	D05006	Mucin domains are resistant to most commercially available proteases, which makes them difficult to analyze by traditional MS strategies.

PMC7542363	I03000	Few glycoprotein-targeting zinc metallo-endopeptidases have been structurally characterized.
PMC7542363	I03002	Metzincin proteases have a characteristic extended zinc-binding motif (HEXXHXXGXXH) and a conserved Met turn, whereas gluzincin proteases have a glutamate residue in the zinc-binding motif (HEXXHE) (18).
PMC7542363	I03006	Interestingly, these repeats share fold similarities to a domain present in the metzincin protease StcE, a secreted glycoprotease from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), though their detailed sequence and structural similarities are very limited (13, 20).
PMC7542363	I03007	StcE is also a T2SS-secreted protease known to target highly O-glycosylated epithelial substrates, such as CD55 (16, 17, 21,–23).
PMC7542363	M02002	PCR was carried out using Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific).
PMC7542363	M05003	Protein samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with polyclonal anti-CpaA (1:1,000) (8) and/or monoclonal anti-RNA polymerase (1:2,000; BioLegend).
PMC7542363	M14002	This protein arranges its C-terminal tail into the CpaA catalytic site, similar to zymogens of related metallopeptidases (62), and we assume that this portion of CpaB is displaced by substrate.
PMC7542363	R00004	Glycoproteases targeting mucins show a wide variability in terms of substrate preferences, even among members of the same family, and therefore, prediction of their targets is not possible (16, 21,–23, 26,–29).
PMC7542363	R00006	CpaA and CpaAE520A were incubated overnight with several medically relevant and commercially available glycoproteins (CD55, CD46, TIM1, TIM4, and C1 esterase inhibitor [C1-INH]), for which their glycosylation is at least partially characterized.
PMC7542363	R01000	The activity of glycoproteases is differentially impacted by many factors, such as O-glycosylation density and glycan composition.
PMC7542363	R01001	For instance, StcE and TagA, a secreted glycoprotease from Vibrio cholerae, uniquely cleave heavily glycosylated proteins, such as mucins, but they cannot digest less O-glycosylated proteins, such as fetuin (Ft).
PMC7542363	R01003	In contrast, the activity of other glycoproteases, such as the gluzincin IMPa from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is unaffected by the degree of O glycosylation (16).
PMC7542363	R03000	The activity of various glycoproteases can be dependent on, inhibited by, or unaffected by the presence of sialic acid, a negatively charged 9-C sugar with key biological functions (34).
PMC7542363	R03001	For example, glycoproteases from Mannheimia haemolytica and Clostridium perfringens require sialic acid for activity, whereas other glycoproteases are inhibited by this sugar (16, 35, 36).
PMC7542363	R03002	StcE is an example of a glycoprotease that is indifferent to sialic acid (22).
PMC7542363	R07005	A similar lack of binding has been reported for other glycoproteases, which may be due to low-affinity or transient interactions with the glycans (41).
PMC7542363	R10001	CD55 and CD46 levels remained unchanged when cells were infected with A. nosocomialis M2 secreting CpaAE520A, indicating that A. nosocomialis M2 does not secrete any other proteases targeting either glycoprotein (Fig. 5).

PMC7542363	R18004	RNA polymerase was used as loading and lysis controls for whole cell and supernatant samples, respectively.
PMC7542363	R21000	Mounting evidence indicates that both commensal and pathogenic species produce and secrete glycoproteases to modulate adherence, penetrate the inner mucus layer, or evade the host immune response (18, 21, 47).
PMC7542363	R21006	These examples are indicative of the pivotal role of glycoproteases in modulating host-pathogen interactions by targeting various host proteins.
PMC7542363	R21007	Despite their relevance, only a relatively small number of bacterial glycoproteases have been biochemically characterized to various extents (Table 1).
PMC7542363	R21009	These glycoproteases differ in their secretion mechanisms, protease class, domain organization, catalytic site, and recognized targets.
PMC7542363	R21011	CpaA, IMPa, and ZmpC display broad O-glycoprotease activity targeting mucins, regardless of their glycosylation density, as well as O-glycoproteins with low O-glycan chain density (fetuin).
PMC7542363	R21013	In contrast, other glycoproteases can target only a subset of mucins.
PMC7542363	R22000	Due to low amino acid sequence conservation, it is not possible to differentiate proteases from glycoproteases solely on the basis of primary amino acid sequence.
PMC7542363	R22002	Moreover, several factors impact substrate targeting by glycoprotease, including glycan chain identity and density, as well as amino acid composition (Table 1).
PMC7542363	R22004	Thus, even if structural analyses identify putative glycan-binding domains in a protein of interest, it is difficult to predict the specific substrates targeted by the putative glycoprotease.
PMC7542363	R22005	Together with the functional analysis, these studies define a functional class of secreted O-glycoproteases that mediate host-pathogen and host-commensal interactions.
PMC7677002	A00009	The results of antioxidant analyses and antibiotic sensitivity, blood survival, lipase, and hemolysis assays validated the proteomic results.

PMC7677002	D09004	In addition, a glycosyl hydrolase family protein was found to be upregulated upon treatment with citral, and it is involved in the disassembly of existing biofilms (49).
PMC7677002	D09005	Hence, the upregulation of the glycosyl hydrolase family protein could increase biofilm disruption in citral-treated samples.

PMC7677002	M22000	For catalase activity, after electrophoresis, the gel (8%) was washed three times with 50 mM KPi buffer.
PMC7677002	M23000	For superoxide dismutase activity, the 12% gel was incubated in 100 ml of freshly prepared 50 mM KPi buffer with substrates such as 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mg riboflavin, and 16 mg nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT).
PMC7677002	M23003	The superoxide dismutase activity was assessed by the appearance of achromatic bands in the gel with a purple background, and the gel was immediately imaged.
PMC7677002	M26000	The extracellular lipase production of control and citral-treated A. baumannii was assessed using p-nitrophenyl palmitate (pNPP) as the substrate.

PMC7928900	A00001	SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host is mediated by binding of viral spike protein to the Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptor.
PMC7928900	A00002	Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is an essential member of the Renin–Angiotensin system (RAS) involved in maintaining the blood pressure and vascular remodelling.
PMC7928900	A00003	Although Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor is the entry point to the host, recent studies show activation of Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 to modulate the host to develop a suitable environment for its replication.
PMC7928900	A00004	However, the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 activating the immune signals on SARS-CoV-2 attachment is still under investigation.
PMC7928900	A00005	We have used systems biological approach to construct the host regulatory network upon SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.

PMC7928900	D00015	From the knowledge which is gathered from the available literature, it can be conceived that the functional hubs involved in Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2/AGT-axis not only modulated host environment for viral entry and replication, but also secondarily can lead to inadvertent signalling leading to exaggerated immune response.

PMC7928900	I01014	The altered host regulatory signal and the mechanism mediating the immune process on SARS-CoV-2 attachment with the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor is still under investigation.
PMC7928900	I02000	In this study, we use systems biological approach to identify the host regulatory network upon SARS-CoV-2 attachment to the human Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.
PMC7928900	I02002	Interestingly, we have identified the proteins mediating immune signals on SARS-CoV-2 interaction with the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.
PMC7928900	I02003	Additionally, the generated Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 regulatory network will help in understanding the immune molecular regulatory networks influenced by the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 mediated interaction in other body tissues, which may aid in identifying the secondary health complications associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
PMC7928900	M00000	The proteins interacting with the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor were collected from the databases such as BioGRID (https://thebiogrid.org/), Intact (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact/), Human Proteinpedia (http://www.humanproteinpedia.org/) and HPRD (https://www.hprd.org/).
PMC7928900	M00002	The final lung-specific regulatory network was developed to capture the possible downstream signaling events that can be initiated upon the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 mediated modulation that occurs in the human lungs.
PMC7928900	R00000	Regulatory network was constructed, highlighting the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2–protein interaction that represents the modulated host signalling mechanism initiated upon binding of SARS-CoV-2 with the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (Fig. 1).
PMC7928900	R00001	Using a protein interaction database, several host proteins that connect directly or indirectly with the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor was obtained.
PMC7928900	R00004	Particularly, we have identified proteins such as AGT (Angiotensinogen), NTS (Large neuromedin N) and GHRL (Ghrelin and obestatin prepropeptide) that directly connect other proteins in the network, that are assumed to be activated upon viral binding to the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (Fig. 1).

PMC7928900	R02004	We captured the immune signals in the network influenced by the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor.
PMC7928900	R02006	For instance, upon receptor modulation, the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 was found to directly influence the AGT, AGTR2 and AGRT1 through which the immune proteins such as THOP1, GRB2, NOS3 and PRCP were signalled (Fig. 4).

PMC8021180	D01004	The most abundant transcripts found in this extensive study included proteins we have now definitively identified in the EE proteome, such as two WAP domain containing SLP-like proteins, protease inhibitors such as cystatin-domain containing protein and nematode cuticle collagen N-terminal domain containing proteins and chitin binding domain containing proteins such as CBM14 domain containing proteins (Tables ​(Tables11 and S1).
PMC8021180	D04001	One of the most represented groups of proteins we found in the egg proteome were those related to energy and metabolism and included proteins associated with glycolysis (enolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), gluconeogenesis (triosephosphate isomerase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase GTP) and other metabolic enzymes such as alpha-1,4 glucan phosphorylase and malic enzyme (S1 Table).
PMC8021180	D06002	The Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase) was found in the EE proteome (S1 Table) and has also been identified on the adult surface and larval extracts (secreted and somatic) of Toxocara canis [38], in the somatic extract of adults of Fasciola hepatica, and the S. mansoni egg secretome
PMC8021180	D13000	We identified certain glycolytic enzymes such as enolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, as immunoactive components of the T. trichiura EE and FE.
PMC8021180	D13002	Furthermore, enolase plays a vital role in the degradation of the intracellular matrix through the activation of plasminogen facilitating the invasion, migration, and fixation in the host [15,17,33,44] all essential mechanisms to ensure T. trichiura prolonged survival.
PMC8021180	D13004	Enolase and heat shock proteins have also been classified as exosome markers [26,72] in accordance with our findings of enolase lacking signal peptide.
PMC8021180	D13005	Likewise, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase has been previously linked to fibronectin, laminin, entactin, and collagen binding [73] and Cass and collaborators [17] suggested that in the case of S. mansoni this protein could be involved in the attachment of the eggs to host tissues or aid the passage of live eggs across host tissues to the external environment.
PMC8021180	D13006	Our results suggest glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as having a relative abundance in both EE and FE that could align with Cass [17] findings and warrant further study.

PMC8021180	R02006	Proteins with kinase and intracellular cholesterol transport functions were also identified (Table 1).
PMC8021180	R08000	Analysis of band 2W identified poly-cysteine and histidine-tailed protein isoform 2 (PCHTP-2), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), actin, actin 5C, enolase, and epididymal secretory protein E1 (Table 2) and confirmatory analysis with LC-MS/MS also indicating there were other proteins present such as phosphoglycerate kinase, the dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase 48 kDa subunit, adenosylhomocysteinase, tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen, calponin domain containing protein, 3 ketoacyl coenzyme A thiolase, elongation factor 1-alpha and serpin domain containing protein (Table 3) while actin 5C and epididymal secretory protein E1 were not confirmed.
PMC8021180	R09002	The proteomic results of both sections of the band 4W showed some proteins shared between the EE and FE, such as PCHTP-2, Actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, suggesting they are likely to be the major ones in both samples.
PMC8021180	R10004	Although the 2W and 4W major antigenic bands of the EE and FE, respectively, both had a molecular weight of 37 kDa and shared several proteins (PCHTP-2, Actin and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), there were also specific proteins which appeared in only the egg or adult female stage.

PMC8036917	A00002	MPN patients with high risk scores are treated by hydroxyurea (HU), interferon-α, or ruxolitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor.
PMC8036917	D00008	Indeed, HU increases nitric oxide levels causing soluble guanylyl cyclase activation, subsequently increasing cGMP levels and leading to the activation of the gamma globin gene [25].
PMC8036917	D00009	HU also increases the expression of the Lu/BCAM adhesion protein on the surface of RBCs in SCD [26,27] and modulates cell signaling pathways by regulating key effectors such as phosphodiesterase 9 in neutrophils [28] and phosphodiesterase 4A in endothelial cells [29].
PMC8036917	D01000	Ruxolitinib is a widely used drug in PV and myelofibrosis patients where it must be imported in the intracellular compartment in order to block Janus kinase 2 phosphorylation.

PMC8036917	D01006	Although it is interesting to speculate on a similar phenomenon for ruxolitinib, it is unlikely to take place as ruxolitinib binds with high affinity to the ATP-binding site of Janus kinase 2, and no other binding partners or iron-chelating abilities have been documented for this drug.

PMC8045895	A00000	Paraoxonase 1 (paraoxonase 1) enzyme has antioxidative properties and is present in mammalian blood and several other body fluids.
PMC8045895	A00001	In blood, paraoxonase 1 is usually integrated into the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.
PMC8045895	A00002	paraoxonase 1 is a highly versatile enzyme displaying diverse functions such as arylesterase, lactonase, and paraoxonase, among others.
PMC8045895	A00003	paraoxonase 1 activities are usually investigated with artificial substrates, for example, dihydrocoumarin and thiobutyl butyrolactone for lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	A00004	The paraoxonase 1 enzyme activities measured with different substrates tend to be falsely assumed as being equivalent in the literature, although there are poor or weak correlations among the paraoxonase 1 enzyme activities with different substrates.
PMC8045895	A00005	In addition, and despite our knowledge of the factors influencing paraoxonase 1 paraoxonase and arylesterase activities, there is little knowledge of paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity variations and attendant mechanisms.
PMC8045895	A00006	This is important considering further that the lactonase activity is the native activity of paraoxonase 1.
PMC8045895	A00007	We report here a multi-omics analysis of paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	A00008	The influence of genetic variations, particularly of single nucleotide polymorphisms and epigenetic, proteomic, and lipidomic variations on paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity are reviewed.
PMC8045895	A00009	In addition, the influence of various environmental, clinical, and demographic variables on paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity is discussed.
PMC8045895	A00010	Finally, we examine the associations between paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity and health states and common complex diseases such as atherosclerosis, dementias, obesity, and diabetes.
PMC8045895	A00011	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-omics analysis of paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity with an eye to future applications in basic life sciences and translational medicine and the nuances of critically interpreting paraoxonase 1 function with lactones as substrates.
PMC8045895	I00000	Numerous articles have been published in the last decades about serum paraoxonase 1 (paraoxonase 1), an enzyme found in different mammal species and other animals, including fishes, amphibians, and birds, and its association with various medical conditions in humans.
PMC8045895	I00001	Various biological and environmental/social factors can influence paraoxonase 1 expression and activity.
PMC8045895	I01000	The association between paraoxonase 1 and medical conditions is usually investigated with three most common approaches: (1) genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), (2) quantification of enzyme in a biological sample, and (3) measurement of enzymatic activity of paraoxonase 1 as determined using different substrates (Ceron et al., 2014).
PMC8045895	I01001	Gene polymorphisms, enzyme quantity, and enzyme activity are different parameters that may or may not correlate with each other (Costa et al., 2005); however, it is less well understood that different enzymatic activities of paraoxonase 1 may or may not correlate with each other as well.
PMC8045895	I02000	The three main activities of paraoxonase 1 are aryldialkylphosphatase, more commonly known as paraoxonase activity, arylesterase and lactonase activity (Harel et al., 2004).
PMC8045895	I02001	Each of these can be investigated with several different artificial substrates (Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2005); however, the exact physiological substrates of paraoxonase 1 are poorly understood.
PMC8045895	I02003	A possible candidate for a physiological substrate is homocysteine thiolactone, which is a known risk factor in atherosclerotic vascular diseases; however, paraoxonase 1 has rather low thiolactonase activity (Aharoni et al., 2004).
PMC8045895	I03000	Paraoxonase activity is unlikely to be a native activity of paraoxonase 1, as organophosphates are uncommon in nature (Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2005; Metcalf and Bruno, 2016).
PMC8045895	I03001	Structure-reactivity studies suggest that the primary function of paraoxonase 1 in terms of evolutionary development is lactonase activity (Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2005).
PMC8045895	I03002	Especially paraoxonase activity is often poorly correlated with the other two enzymatic activities (Gugliucci et al., 2015; Kowalska et al., 2018; Martinelli et al., 2013; Romani et al., 2009; Rosenblat et al., 2006).
PMC8045895	I03003	Thus, the experimental results of paraoxonase 1 can be grouped by enzymatic activity and those research articles in which the same activity has been investigated, preferably with the same substrate, can be compared.
PMC8045895	I04000	An extensive review on paraoxonase and arylesterase activities has already been published (Dardiotis et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	I04001	However, the literature lacks analyses on paraoxonase 1's native (lactonase) activity.
PMC8045895	I04002	Although different research groups have focused on SNP variation in the paraoxonase 1 gene and its association with enzymatic activity (Dardiotis et al., 2019; Darney et al., 2020), factors besides genotype may also influence the enzymatic activity of paraoxonase 1.
PMC8045895	I04003	Hence, in this study, we examine different -omics levels that have been associated specifically with the lactonase activity of paraoxonase 1.
PMC8045895	I04004	This article is the first to specifically address and review the lactonase activity of paraoxonase 1.
PMC8045895	I05000	In this analysis, we also examine and synthesize the associations between various medical conditions and the lactonase activity of paraoxonase 1.
PMC8045895	I05001	As paraoxonase 1 has antioxidative activity, its lactonase activity may be correlated with oxidative stress- and inflammation-related diseases, primarily those associated with aging.
PMC8045895	I05002	Indeed paraoxonase 1 activity is shown to be associated with neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), as well as diabetes, cancer, and other disorders (Shunmoogam et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	I06000	Most of the research on paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity has been performed on humans; however, some research groups also investigated lactonase activity in mice, rats, and cows (Farid et al., 2013;
PMC8045895	I06002	A number of studies also focused on recombinant variants of paraoxonase 1 (rePON1).
PMC8045895	I06003	Because rePON1 variants, unlike native paraoxonase 1, are water soluble, they are preferred instead of native paraoxonase 1 for the investigation of general properties of paraoxonases and for biotechnological applications.
PMC8045895	I06004	However, these investigations are not included in this study because they are of limited relevance to this article's focus on biological influences of paraoxonase 1 activity, and on paraoxonase 1's influence on the phenome in turn.
PMC8045895	I07000	The two most common lactone substrates used on paraoxonase 1 are dihydrocoumarin (DHC) and thiobutyl butyrolactone (TBBL), which have been cited in at least 100 research articles.
PMC8045895	I08001	Some of the factors discussed in this article (e.g., variations in the promoter sequence of the paraoxonase 1 gene) are likely to primarily affect the amount of paraoxonase 1 that is present in an organism, whereas others (e.g., the presence of drugs interacting with PON1 in the bloodstream) are likely to primarily influence PON1's affinity for its substrates.
PMC8045895	I08002	Because almost all the studies cited in this article used specific activity as the only measure of paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity, it is usually not possible to disentangle these two components.
PMC8045895	M00002	paraoxonase 1, paraoxonase 1, TBBL, TBL, DHC, dihydrocoumarin, valerolactone, and the combinations of these.
PMC8045895	M00003	We also searched the references of all the articles thus obtained for additional articles that might discuss paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	M01000	It has been emphasized that in any study investigating paraoxonase 1 activity, cases and controls should be matched for paraoxonase 1 haplotype, as the amount of PON1 activity is mainly determined by SNP distribution (Mackness and Mackness, 2015).
PMC8045895	M01001	As the overall number of articles dealing with lactonase paraoxonase 1 activity is limited, this criterion could not be fulfilled in this analysis, which is structured according to the omics taxonomy proposed previously (Pirih and Kunej, 2017).
PMC8045895	R00001	Of the 46 articles in question, 17 discuss the various effects on paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R01001	The influences of genetics, epigenetics, proteomics, and the lipid environment of paraoxonase 1 were grouped together as “biological” effects.
PMC8045895	R01003	The most thoroughly studied influence on paraoxonase 1 activity has been that of genetics, followed by molecular environment.
PMC8045895	R01004	The latter is particularly connected to the lipids and proteins that together compose high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and associate with paraoxonase 1 protein.
PMC8045895	R02000	The two most frequently reported polymorphisms on the human paraoxonase 1 gene are SNPs that change the amino acid sequence of paraoxonase 1, rs662 and rs854560, also referred to as Q192R and L55M, respectively (Shunmoogam et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R02001	There is one more SNP in the coding region of paraoxonase 1, rs13306698 or R160G, with a rather low minor allele frequency of 0.02–0.11; there are no studies investigating it in connection with paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R02002	There are also several other SNPs present either in introns or the promoter region of paraoxonase 1, of which the best known is rs705379 (also referred as -107 C/T or -108 C/T) (Shunmoogam et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R03000	Two different articles provided numbers for the percentage of variation of activity that is explained by each of the main parameters, such as genetic variations and sex, affecting paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity (Quillen et al., 2012; Rainwater et al., 2009).
PMC8045895	R03003	The genetic factors explained 67% of all the observed interindividual variation, of which 47% of the variation was traced back to chromosome 7, on which the paraoxonase 1 gene is located (Rainwater et al., 2009).
PMC8045895	R04001	Five loci on chromosomes 3, 4, and 17 explained 7.8% of genetic variation in paraoxonase 1 activity where lactone was used as a substrate.
PMC8045895	R04002	Genetic polymorphisms Q192R and L55M account for 8.3 and 4.1% of interindividual variation in paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity, respectively, whereas four other SNPs in promoter region, rs854522, rs854534, rs757158, and rs7803148, account for 1.8%, 3.8%, 9.2%, and 1.1% of variability, respectively.
PMC8045895	R05001	Chen et al. (2020) investigated the effect of ncRNA on paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R05002	Two ncRNAs were studied in association with paraoxonase 1, namely long ncRNA Linc-OIP5 and short ncRNA micro-RNA miR-616.
PMC8045895	R05003	It was shown that low levels of Linc-OIP5 correspond to lower levels of paraoxonase 1 expression and lactonase activity, whereas high levels of miR-616 gene expression had the opposite effect and decreased paraoxonase 1 expression and lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R06000	The activities of paraoxonase 1 toward lactones, phosphotriesters, and arylesters were suggested to all reside in the same active site (Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2005); however, different changes to paraoxonase 1 structure might have an uneven effect on different PON1 activities.
PMC8045895	R06001	Hernandez et al. (2009) and Ferretti et al. (2010) investigated the effect of changes in paraoxonase 1 structure on lactonase activity (Ferretti et al., 2010; Hernandez et al., 2009).
PMC8045895	R07001	Hernandez et al. (2009) investigated this hypothesis by adding different metals in vitro in concentrations that could also be encountered in vivo (e.g., after prolonged exposure) and analyzing paraoxonase 1 activity in the sera of healthy volunteers.
PMC8045895	R07002	Of the seven metals investigated, only zinc had a statistically significant influence on paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity, and at the same time lactonase was the only activity affected by addition of zinc.
PMC8045895	R07003	The authors suggest that zinc inhibits paraoxonase 1 activity by binding to several histidines (His-115, -134, -155 and -243) that are essential amino acids for the arylesterase and paraoxonase activities of paraoxonase 1 (Josse et al., 2002).
PMC8045895	R08000	A similar analysis was carried out investigating the effect of in vitro homocysteinylation of HDL particles, which is known to occur in vivo, on paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity (Ferretti et al., 2010).
PMC8045895	R08001	The authors demonstrated a decrease in lactonase activity with increasing addition of homocystein thiolactone.
PMC8045895	R08002	The concentrations they used were from 10 to 1000 μM, and the last of them led to a two-third decrease in lactonase activity compared with the control HDL, where HcyT was absent.
PMC8045895	R09000	The lipidomic context of paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity was investigated with DHC as a substrate in two articles (Rosenblat et al., 2006, 2012).
PMC8045895	R10001	They analyzed arylesterase, paraoxonase, and lactonase activities, and as expected, no activity was observed in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), whereas all three activities were observed in the HDL fraction.
PMC8045895	R11000	Of interest, paraoxonase activity was similar in HDL and LPDS, whereas arylesterase and lactonase activities were significantly higher in HDL compared with LPDS.
PMC8045895	R11001	With lactonase, the difference in activity between HDL and LPDS was greatest.
PMC8045895	R11002	Rosenblat et al. (2006) suggested that the environment in HDL stabilizes paraoxonase 1's structure; displacement from HDL causes conformational changes that reduce lactonase and arylesterase activity, whereas paraoxonase activity is less sensitive to such changes.
PMC8045895	R12000	In the second article, Rosenblat et al. (2012) reported the influence of VLDL and free triglycerides on the activity of serum paraoxonase 1.
PMC8045895	R12001	The authors distinguished paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity in the total serum and in HDL-bound paraoxonase 1.
PMC8045895	R12002	The addition of VLDL caused a decrease in HDL-bound paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R12004	The authors also investigated bezafibrate as a compound, which reverses the effect of VLDL on paraoxonase and arylesterase activity (Rosenblat et al., 2012).
PMC8045895	R13000	All the macroscopic, behavioral, and personal parameters with which researchers have attempted to explain interindividual variation in paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity, such as age, gender, exercise, diet/nutriomics, medications, and exposure to chemicals, were grouped together as “Environmental/Social effects.”
PMC8045895	R14000	Although the influence of age on paraoxonase 1 activity in humans is still not entirely clear for adolescents and adults, it has been shown that neonatal paraoxonase 1 arylesterase activity is much lower than that of toddlers (Cole et al, 2003).
PMC8045895	R14001	For lactonase activity, Gugliucci et al.
PMC8045895	R14003	Although the difference between the two categories of women was not significant, newborns had on average 23% and 37% of the paraoxonase 1 lactonase and arylesterase activity of their mothers, respectively (Gugliucci et al., 2014).
PMC8045895	R15000	In several articles, the authors grouped their results on lactonase activity into categories, including age.
PMC8045895	R15001	An example of such a study is the genome-wide association approach by Quillen et al. (2012), where the authors identified that age accounts for 1.4% of interindividual variation in paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity (Quillen et al., 2012).
PMC8045895	R16000	Among other factors that influence paraoxonase 1 activity, Quillen et al. (2012) also focused on the effect of gender on lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R16001	Although the authors' model indicates that 0.4% of the interindividual difference in both paraoxonase and arylesterase activities can be explained by gender, we suggest that gender does not appreciably explain interindividual variation in DHC lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R17000	A more recent article also focused on the influence of gender on paraoxonase 1, with TBL as a substrate, and concludes that gender does influence lactonase activity (Trentini et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	R17001	Trentini et al. detected higher paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity among women than among men, even after accounting for confounders such as concentrations of HDL and cholesterol, age, smoking, body mass index, and waist circumference.
PMC8045895	R17002	The authors reported a significant difference between genders for both lactonase and arylesterase activities (Trentini et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	R18001	When investigating the association between paraoxonase 1 activity and medical conditions, the influence of diet on enzymatic activity is thus a major potential confounder.
PMC8045895	R18002	One foodstuff, which has been associated with paraoxonase 1 activity in several articles, is pomegranate.
PMC8045895	R18003	Rock et al. (2008) measured the effect of pomegranate juice on lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R18004	The authors concluded that pomegranate juice consumption temporarily and significantly increases serum paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity, both in HDL and LPDS, when both DHC and TBBL were used as substrates.
PMC8045895	R19000	Aviram and Rosenblat (2012) also investigated how the consumption of several different juices impacts paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity for DHC.
PMC8045895	R19001	They found that in healthy subjects, consumption of currant juice and pomegranate juice both led to an increase in paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity after 1 week.
PMC8045895	R19002	Acai, grape juice, and wine however did not significantly impact paraoxonase 1 activity (Aviram and Rosenblat, 2012).
PMC8045895	R20000	Kameyama et al. (2016) studied the impact of diet on paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R20001	In their study, male volunteers who consumed three different meals and lactonase activity, with TBBL as a substrate, was determined after consumption of these meals.
PMC8045895	R20003	paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity was significantly decreased by 5% in the postprandial period after all test meals.
PMC8045895	R20004	Conversely, arylesterase activity was increased by 10% in all three groups.
PMC8045895	R20005	However, the type of meal did not influence subsequent lactonase and arylesterase activities.
PMC8045895	R21000	Model organisms have also been used to perform experiments about the impact of diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R21001	No significant difference in lactonase activity of rat serum before and after a PUFA-rich meal has been demonstrated.
PMC8045895	R21002	Moreover, authors also found no difference in lactonase activity between the nondiabetic control without oil administration and the diabetic group (Kopál et al., 2014).
PMC8045895	R22000	Although the interactions of paraoxonase 1 with various mediations have been established and are displayed in databases such as DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2017), only few of these studies investigated lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R22001	For example, of the 12 articles focusing on association of paraoxonase 1 activity and medications for schizophrenia, which were analyzed in a recent review (Moreira et al., 2018), only Gilca et al. (2014) investigated lactonase activity using DHC as a substrate.
PMC8045895	R23001	compared lactonase activity in patients taking clozapine, patients taking risperidone, and with healthy individuals.
PMC8045895	R23002	The authors demonstrated that taking risperidone resulted in significantly lower lactonase activity than the healthy control group.
PMC8045895	R23003	The authors also showed that the patients taking clozapine in turn had a significantly lower lactonase activity than the patients taking risperidone.
PMC8045895	R24000	Another group of medications, which has been associated with paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity in one study, are oral contraceptives (Kowalska et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R24001	The authors concluded that taking contraceptives correlated with a significant increase in lactonase and arylesterase activity, but with a significant decrease in paraoxonase activity.
PMC8045895	R25000	paraoxonase 1 is among the few enzymes that offer protection against organophosphate pesticides.
PMC8045895	R25001	Lozano-Paniagua et al. (2016) conducted a study in which they addressed the effect of pesticide exposure on paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity for DHC.
PMC8045895	R25002	The authors concluded that while lactonase activity is not significantly affected by the amount of exposure to pesticides, there is a significant decrease in lactonase activity in greenhouse workers in comparison with the healthy controls with no occupational exposure to pesticides.
PMC8045895	R25003	The authors tested several different organophosphate substrates and reported that higher exposure to pesticides did however lead to a significant decrease in arylesterase activity and, interestingly, to a nonsignificant increase in paraoxonase activity (Lozano-Paniagua et al., 2016).
PMC8045895	R26000	A study followed the effects of an exercise regimen in a group of obese human subjects on the DHC lactonase and paraoxonase activities of their serum paraoxonase 1 (Russo et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R27003	A significant increase in paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity was found in physically active and physically active stressed rats with respect to the sedentary and sedentary-stressed rats.
PMC8045895	R27004	Significant increase in arylesterase activity was found in physically active rats in comparison with the sedentary, sedentary-stressed, and physically active stressed rats.
PMC8045895	R28000	paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity has been studied regarding several diseases and other medical conditions.
PMC8045895	R28003	Of the 46 articles listed in Table 1 and discussed in this study, 28 concern themselves with various medical condition that have been associated with paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R29000	Of all the medical conditions studied in association with paraoxonase 1 activity, one of the most frequently investigated one is CVD: coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis.
PMC8045895	R29001	Many articles have been published investigating the association of these with paraoxonase 1, including six articles that included lactonase activity, four of which have been carried out on humans (Gugliucci et al., 2015; Martinelli et al., 2009; Murillo-González et al., 2020; Ponce-Ruiz et al., 2020) and two on animals (De Keyzer et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010).
PMC8045895	R30001	The authors concluded that DHC lactonase activity was similar between the CRF and CVD groups, and both of which were significantly lower than the lactonase activity of the control group.
PMC8045895	R31001	At first, the difference in TBBL lactonase activity between both groups was nonsignificant.
PMC8045895	R31002	The authors then normalized TBBL activity by dividing it with 7-O-diethyl phosphoryl,3-cyano,4-methyl,7-hydroxycoumarin (DEPCyMC) activity, which has been indicated as a surrogate marker for determining paraoxonase 1 concentration (Gaidukov and Tawfik, 2007).
PMC8045895	R32000	The resulting normalized lactonase activity was significantly higher in the group with CAD, especially noticeable in individuals with the paraoxonase 1 192QQ genotype.
PMC8045895	R32001	When they grouped the CAD patients into those with and without myocardial infarction, however, they found no significant difference for any measure of lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R32002	Other paraoxonase 1 enzyme activities were not significantly different between any two categories of patients that they compared.
PMC8045895	R33000	Gugliucci et al. (2015) compared two different ethnic populations, Palestinians and Israelis, and their paraoxonase 1 enzymatic activities.
PMC8045895	R33001	They found that Palestinians had significantly lower DHC lactonase and arylesterase activities, whereas paraoxonase activity was similar in both populations.
PMC8045895	R33002	From this finding, the authors concluded that the lower lactonase paraoxonase 1 activity in a Palestinian population is a risk factor for CAD and diabetes.
PMC8045895	R34000	Another study investigated paraoxonase 1 activity in apolipoprotein-deficient mice expressing human paraoxonase 1 by adenovirus-mediated insertion of human paraoxonase 1 (hPON1) into mice cells (Zhang et al., 2010).
PMC8045895	R34001	The authors investigated the size of atherosclerotic lesions, which are a risk factor for CVD, and found that transgenic mice with overexpressed hPON1 had significantly higher DHC lactonase activity in their serum, and reduced atherosclerotic lesion size.
PMC8045895	R35000	The paraoxonase 1–atherosclerosis association has also been investigated in pigs (De Keyzer et al., 2009).
PMC8045895	R35002	As the group fed with a cholesterol-rich diet had both significantly higher paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity for TBBL and larger atherosclerotic plaques, the authors concluded that paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity correlates with atherosclerosis.
PMC8045895	R36000	paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity has also been investigated in association with liver illnesses.
PMC8045895	R36002	It was found that paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity for DHC was significantly lower in alcoholic hepatitis compared with controls, and being significantly lower in viral hepatitis compared with alcoholic hepatitis.
PMC8045895	R36003	Both significant differences were the same for arylesterase activity.
PMC8045895	R37000	In another article, the authors investigated TBBL lactonase activity of paraoxonase 1 in individuals with liver cirrhosis and patients with mild-to-moderate changes in liver function (Marsillach et al., 2009).
PMC8045895	R37001	The authors did not find a statistically significant correlation between enzymatic activities of paraoxonase 1 and the presence and/or severity of disease.
PMC8045895	R38000	Serum lactonase activity for DHC was also investigated in dairy cows (Samir Farid et al., 2013).
PMC8045895	R38002	The authors concluded that paraoxonase, DHC lactonase, and arylesterase activity were all significantly lower in animals with fatty liver compared with the control group.
PMC8045895	R39000	Another factor that has been thoroughly studied in association with paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity is body weight.
PMC8045895	R39001	Three articles reported on the association between body weight and DHC lactonase activity (Alaminos-Castillo et al., 2019; Bacchetti et al., 2019; Rupérez et al., 2013), Ferré et al. (2013) investigated TBBL and Cervellati et al.
PMC8045895	R39004	Of these five articles, three of them found a significant correlation between paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity and obesity (Alaminos-Castillo et al., 2019; Bacchetti et al., 2019; Ferré et al., 2013).
PMC8045895	R40000	Alaminos-Castillo et al. (2019) reported that DHC lactonase activity is significantly decreased in obese subjects compared with nonobese controls, and increases after surgery.
PMC8045895	R40001	Bacchetti et al. (2019) grouped cases into two categories, overweight women and obese women, and detected that DHC lactonase activity is significantly decreased in each subsequent category compared with healthy individuals (Bacchetti et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	R40002	Ferré et al. (2013) showed a significant decrease in TBBL lactonase activity in obese children compared with nonobese controls.
PMC8045895	R40003	paraoxonase 1 concentration was the same in both groups, based on which the authors suggested that in obese children, there is higher oxidative stress, which leads to partial inhibition of paraoxonase 1 by lipid peroxides.
PMC8045895	R41000	Rupérez et al (2013) did not find an association between paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity and obesity.
PMC8045895	R41001	Although the authors did not find an association between childhood obesity and any of paraoxonase 1's enzymatic activities, they did find a positive correlation of DHC lactonase activity with HDL, as well as with concentration of antioxidants.
PMC8045895	R41004	demonstrated a significant decrease in arylesterase activity in very obese subjects; however, they did not show any difference in paraoxonase activity and TBBL lactonase activity between the groups.
PMC8045895	R41005	Hence, the authors concluded that the apparent obesity-associated decrease of paraoxonase 1 activity might simply reflect the decrease in concentration of HDL.
PMC8045895	R42000	Five articles reported on paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity in the context of diabetes (Craciun et al., 2016, Rosenblat et al., 2006, Passaro et al., 2018, Zhou et al., 2020a, 2020b).
PMC8045895	R43000	In women with gestational diabetes mellitus, no significant difference was found in either TBBL lactonase activity or paraoxonase 1 concentration between women with diabetes and healthy controls (Zhou et al., 2020a).
PMC8045895	R44001	A significant decrease in δ-valerolactone lactonase activity was noted between controls and patients who had both type 1 diabetes and a high amount of hemoglobin glycation.
PMC8045895	R44002	No difference was found between cases and controls for any other type of paraoxonase 1 activity (paraoxonase or arylesterase).
PMC8045895	R45000	DHC lactonase activity was also investigated in a study that compared patients with diabetes, patients with hypercholesterolemia, and healthy controls.
PMC8045895	R45001	The conclusion was that lactonase activity was significantly reduced in both groups of patients, where diabetic patients had the lowest activity.
PMC8045895	R45002	The same results were acquired for both paraoxonase activity and arylesterase activity (Rosenblat et al., 2006).
PMC8045895	R46001	compared paraoxonase 1 activity for TBL in patients with type 2 diabetes and in healthy controls.
PMC8045895	R46002	The authors concluded that there is no correlation between lactonase activity and presence of diabetes, whereas diabetic patients on average had significantly lower arylesterase activity than healthy controls (Passaro et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R47001	compared paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity for TBBL in neonates with diabetic mothers and in neonates with mothers without diabetes (Zhou et al., 2020b).
PMC8045895	R47002	They found a significant increase in both lactonase activity and DEPCyMC-normalized lactonase activity in children of diabetic patients compared with healthy controls.
PMC8045895	R48000	paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity for DHC was also compared for Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy controls.
PMC8045895	R48001	The researchers measured lactonase activity and calculated the quotients lactonase activity/HDL concentration and lactonase activity/LDL concentration.
PMC8045895	R49000	Several other medical conditions were studied in association with paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity: among them are intestinal cancer, psoriasis, celiac disease, hereditary hemochromatosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD), renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPB), bronchial asthma, and acute pancreatitis.
PMC8045895	R50000	Bains et al. (2019) compared paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity in patients with intestinal cancer before and after treatment.
PMC8045895	R50001	The authors concluded that both arylesterase and DHC lactonase activity significantly decreased after the surgery (compared with before treatment), and then increased again with time (Bains et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	R51000	In psoriatic children, DHC lactonase activity of paraoxonase 1, as well as arylesterase and paraoxonase activities were found to all be significantly reduced compared with healthy controls (Bacchetti et al., 2020).
PMC8045895	R51001	The authors also measured the concentration of myeloperoxidase (myeloperoxidase), another enzyme in HDL, which can interact with paraoxonase 1 and influence its activity.
PMC8045895	R51002	myeloperoxidase concentration and activity were both significantly decreased and negatively correlated with a decrease in all paraoxonase 1 enzymatic activities in psoriatic patients.
PMC8045895	R52000	A significant decrease in paraoxonase 1 DHC lactonase activity was shown in celiac disease (Ferretti et al., 2012).
PMC8045895	R52001	Lactonase activity was lower in diet-treated patients compared with healthy controls, and even lower in patients at diagnosis, when they had not yet begun their diet.
PMC8045895	R52002	Similar results were obtained for paraoxonase 1 arylesterase and paraoxonase activities.
PMC8045895	R53000	In hereditary hemochromatosis, paraoxonase 1 paraoxonase activity was significantly decreased in patients with the condition compared with healthy controls, but DHC lactonase and arylesterase activities were not decreased significantly (Martinelli et al., 2013).
PMC8045895	R53001	The authors also subdivided patients into those undergoing treatment through phlebotomy and those not undergoing it, and found that none of the paraoxonase 1 activities correlated with presence of treatment, except for DEPCyMCase activity.
PMC8045895	R54000	In CKD, a significant decrease in paraoxonase 1 benzopiran-2-one lactonase activity was reported in cases compared with healthy controls (Mohammed et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	R54001	After adjusting for concentration, the authors showed that lactonase activity was significantly higher in patients compared with non-CKD controls.
PMC8045895	R54002	The authors also compared the groups of CKD patients with high and low lactonase activity in terms of survival rate and reported that patients with higher lactonase activity also had a higher survival rate.
PMC8045895	R54003	No such difference in survival rate was shown when comparing the group with a high paraoxonase 1 enzyme concentration against the group with a low paraoxonase 1 concentration.
PMC8045895	R55000	For end-stage renal patients, a study compared DHC lactonase before and after dialysis and found that activity increases significantly after dialysis, as do arylesterase and paraoxonase activities (Gugliucci et al., 2011).
PMC8045895	R56001	Both groups of patients had significantly lower TBBL lactonase activities than controls.
PMC8045895	R56002	The same trend was present with paraoxonase activity (Soler et al., 2013).
PMC8045895	R57000	In the case of bronchial asthma, both arylesterase and DHC lactonase paraoxonase 1 activities were shown to be lower in asthmatics compared with healthy controls (Chen et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R57001	The authors verified this by addition of paraoxonase 1 to the serum sample, which resulted in a very significant rise in lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R58001	In both the smoking- and the nonsmoking group, pancreatitis patients had significantly lower paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity upon admission to hospital than healthy controls.
PMC8045895	R58002	Both the smoking and nonsmoking patients' paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity significantly declined on both day 3 and day 7 of hospitalization compared with day 1.
PMC8045895	R58003	When the authors measured paraoxonase 1 arylesterase activity, they found significantly lower activity in pancreatitis patients compared with healthy controls for both subgroups.
PMC8045895	R58004	For paraoxonase 1 paraoxonase activity, there was significantly lower activity in pancreatitis patients in comparison with healthy controls, for the nonsmoking subgroups (Marek et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R59000	Different approaches for measuring paraoxonase 1 lactonase activity do not produce the same results.
PMC8045895	R59002	Ceron et al. (2014) published an extensive and systematic review on measurement of serum paraoxonase 1 activity, presenting the main reference for paraoxonase 1 experimental conditions.
PMC8045895	R59003	In their articles, the authors focused on two lactone substrates, TBBL and DHC, two arylesterase substrates, phenyl acetate and 4-nitrophenyl acetate, and paraoxon.
PMC8045895	R60000	paraoxonase 1 activity that was reported in the studies cited by the present review was always presented as specific enzyme activity.
PMC8045895	R65001	Billecke et al. (2000) compared the specific activities of human paraoxonase 1 isoforms Q and R for DHC and found a difference of <20% between these two isoforms, whereas the difference between the highest and the lowest observed specific activity in Table 2 of this article is more than an order of magnitude.
PMC8045895	R66001	EDTA binds calcium, which is a cofactor of paraoxonase 1, and thus irreversibly inhibits the enzyme.
PMC8050915	D02000	Liver enzymes, especially Alanine Aminotransferase and Aspartate Aminotransferase, are the first laboratory tests every clinician will consider worth evaluating in a patient with liver diseases.
PMC8050915	F45002	Higher concentrations of alanine aminotransferase within the reference interval predict nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.
PMC8050915	I01005	Alanine aminotransferase (Alanine Aminotransferase) and aspartate aminotransferase (Aspartate Aminotransferase) are the most common blood indicators; however, such liver enzymes may not elevate until histological injury of the liver occurs [14].
PMC8050915	I01006	A number of patients with normal Alanine Aminotransferase levels may also have NAFLD and even advanced fibrosis.
PMC8050915	M07001	Measurements of blood glucose, Alanine Aminotransferase, Aspartate Aminotransferase, TB, DB, TP, ALB, Che, ALP, γ—GT, TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C and other serum indicators were performed on an automated chemistry analyzer (Hitachi 7600d-210, Japan).
PMC8050915	R01000	From Table ​Table1,1, we found that there was no remarkable difference in biochemical indexes (including TBA, CHE, TB, DB, TP, ALB, γ-Glutamyltransferase, ALP, Aspartate Aminotransferase, ALT and GLU) between the NAFLD group and the control group (p > 0.05).
PMC8125016	A01005	These effects were mainly caused by increased cyclin dependent kinase 1 and 2 (cyclin dependent kinase 1 and 2), LIM domain kinase 1 and 2 (LIM domain kinase 1 and 2), mitogen-activated protein kinase 7 (MAPK7) and protein kinase C delta (PRKCD) activity in responder cells.
PMC8125016	D04010	Finally, immune-mediated mechanisms may also be important for chemosensitivity because ATRA/VP reduces the levels of circulating T cells [5] and members of the neutrophil degranulation network are regarded as a possible leukemia-associated antigen (proteinase 3, PRTN3) and as a regulator of antileukemic immune reactivity (major histocompatibility complex, class I, B; HLA-B).
PMC8125016	D06003	However, the regulation of ELANE, NME/NM23 nucleoside diphosphate kinase 3, NME3, and hydroxyesteroid 17-beta dehydrogenase 11, HSD17B11, by both -omics approaches, well represent the biological mechanisms that are affected in the two patient groups (Table A1).
PMC8125016	D07005	Third, experimental studies suggest that the expression of lysine acetyltransferase 2B (GCN5) and lysine demethylase 1A (LSD1) may be important for the antileukemic effect of ATRA
PMC8125016	D07007	Finally, aldehyde dehydrogenases are important for both the synthesis of retinoids and the metabolism of reactive aldehydes.
PMC8125016	D07008	However, aldehyde dehydrogenase activity may be generally high among our patients because both high-risk chemoresistance and AML in the elderly are associated with high protein levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 family member (ALDH2)
PMC8125016	D08007	Our present study suggests that the AML cell biology for a subset of NPM1-insertion (INS)/fms-related receptor tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplications (FLT3-ITD) negative non-responders differs from other non-responders, including NPM1-INS positive non-responders.
PMC8125016	D10001	Histone deacetylase inhibitors and DNA methylation inhibitors also seem to have overlapping effects on gene expression [98].
PMC8125016	D11002	Our kinase prediction analyses identified an enrichment of LIMK1/K2 and cyclin dependent kinase substrates in the responder group.
PMC8125016	D11004	LIMK1 expression was significantly correlated with shorter survival of AML patients along with FLT3 mutations, lysine methyltransferase 2A (KMT2A) rearrangements and elevated homeobox D10 (HOXD10) gene expression [101].
PMC8125016	D11005	Furthermore, it was observed a reciprocal regulation between LIM kinases and CDK6.
PMC8125016	D11006	Our present work observed a high activity of both kinase types (not reciprocity) although LIM domain kinase 1 and 2 activity was enhanced in treatment-responders.
PMC8125016	D11007	As the LIMK1-mediated cofilin pathway appeared to modulate retinoid receptor functionality, the role of LIM kinases in the survival of patients treated with AML-stabilizing therapy requires further investigations [102].
PMC8125016	D12006	A dependency of the prognostic impact of a certain biomarker on the received treatment has also been described in other diseases, e.g., the impact of the BCR-ABL translocation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treated with kinase inhibitors [103] and especially the Burkit B cell variant of ALL that was originally regarded as a high-risk variant but was later classified as a favorable variant when new therapeutic strategies were introduced [104].
PMC8125016	D13003	Moreover, several proteins (ANO6, PLD1, ARSA, myeloperoxidase and CPNE3) of the neutrophil degranulation cluster upregulated in PRE-R patients, with the exception of ARSA, were also found to be regulated in the paired sample study with AML cells derived at both first diagnosis and first relapse time points and in the high-risk vs. low-risk comparison (Figure S5b and S5c)
PMC8125016	D15011	Finally, the most important additional effects on phosphoproteomic profiles also involved GTPase activity and G-protein signaling for responders and non-responders, respectively.
PMC8125016	D15013	In our previous phosphoproteomics study on relapse-free and relapse patients CSNK2A1, CDKs and PRKCA/protein kinase C delta were found to influence AML prognosis [26].
PMC8125016	D15014	Herein, while PRKCA/protein kinase C delta were predicted to be activated in responders and non-responders in earlier stages of the triple combination, CSNK2A1 seemed to be activated in non-responders at day 8 of the treatment (Figure 7c) suggesting a CSNK2A1-VP crosstalk that might influence cell cycle progression.

PMC8125016	M13006	Kinase activity estimates were predicted with the online KSEA App.
PMC8125016	M13009	Significantly regulated kinases with false discovery rate (FDR) <0.05 were shown in bar plots created with Prism8.
PMC8125016	M13010	Kinase prediction analysis by deep learning with the DeepPhos architecture was performed in the piNET web platform [48,49].
PMC8125016	M13011	The kinase activation loop analysis was carried out with the online tool at http://phomics.jensenlab.org (accessed on October 2020).
PMC8125016	R05001	These terms include proteins such as myeloperoxidase (myeloperoxidase), elastase, neutrophil expressed (ELANE), FGR proto-oncogene, Src family tyrosine kinase (FGR), serpin family B member 1 (SERPINB1), chitinase 3 like 1 (CHI3L1)
PMC8125016	R06000	In contrast, levels of proteins involved in processes such as hematopoietic or lymphoid organ development (e.g., sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase 1, SGPL1; SBDS ribosome maturation factor, SBDS), transcription by RNA polymerase II and cell death were higher in PRE-NR patients (Figure 2b, bottom plot; Table 2).
PMC8125016	R06002	The sphingolipid metabolism was the most significant KEGG pathway in this group with higher levels of SGPL1 and arylsulfatase A (ARSA).
PMC8125016	R07002	One of them was composed of 10 proteins mostly involved in catalytic antimicrobial activity and described in the GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis (Figure 2b, top plot) while the other was composed of four proteins connected to specific granule membrane (i.e., ANO6, phospholipase D1, PLD1; mast cell expressed membrane protein 1, MCEMP1; motile sperm domain containing 2, MOSPD2).
PMC8125016	R10002	In regard to the PRE-NR group, several phosphoproteins involved in mRNA splicing/binding (e.g., heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein M, HNRNPM; NPM1; microtubule associated protein 4, MAP4; matrin 3, MATR3) and in protein tyrosine kinase binding (interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein, IL1RAP; phosphoprotein membrane anchor with glycosphingolipid microdomains 1, PAG1) were significantly overrepresented.
PMC8125016	R11001	One of them involved RNA splicing factors such as serine/arginine repetitive matrix protein 2, SRRM2; splicing factor 3b subunit 1, SF3B1; splicing factor 1, SF1; and serine and arginine rich splicing factor 11, SRSF11; while the other one was composed of ribosomal protein S10, RPS10; ribosomal protein S6, RPS6; and RIO kinase 2, RIOK2.
PMC8125016	R11002	A sequence logo of the amino acid sequence windows surrounding the phosphorylation sites of the splicing factor network (Figure S1) identified the SP and the SXR/K motifs for mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and protein kinase C delta/protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha protein kinase C delta/PRKACA, respectively, although RNA polymerase II subunit A (POLR2A) S1920 and SRSF11 S207 are phosphorylated by cyclin dependent kinase (cyclin dependent kinase)1 and CDK2, respectively [46].
PMC8125016	R11003	The phosphorylation of RPS6 at S236 by several members of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase family (i.e., RPS6KA1, RPS6KA3 or RPS6KB1) facilitates the assembly of the translation preinitiation complex [57] whereas polo like kinase 1 (PLK1) phosphorylation at RIOK2 S380 regulates mitotic progression [58].
PMC8125016	R12001	Among them, four phosphoproteins showed a higher phosphorylation in PRE-R patients (i.e., cofilin 1, CFL1; RPS6, protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 2, PTPN2; and MYC associated factor X, MAX).
PMC8125016	R13000	The F-actin depolymerizing activity of CFL1 is inactivated by phosphorylation on S3 by NIK related kinase (NRK)/NIK-like embryo-specific kinase (NIK-like embryo-specific kinase), testis associated actin remodeling kinase 1 (TESK1), protein kinase D1 (PRKD1) and LIM domain kinase 1/2 (LIMK1/LIMK2)
PMC8125016	R13002	Interestingly, some of these kinases were predicted to be activated in the PRE-R group by kinase–substrate enrichment analysis (KSEA) (Figure 3e, see results below).
PMC8125016	R13005	However, the role of that phosphorylated residue in its interaction with ATR serine/threonine kinase (ATR) is unknown.
PMC8125016	R15002	However, we also detected differences in kinase activity/intracellular signaling as well as in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis.
PMC8125016	R16000	In order to determine whether the protein phosphorylation levels were due to changes in protein abundance or to kinase activation, we investigated the expression of 85 phosphoproteins to the 107 differentially regulated phosphosites.
PMC8125016	R16004	This demonstrated that most of the differentially regulated phosphorylation sites in the PRE-R vs. PRE-NR study could not be explained by protein expression changes, which suggested an increased kinase-specific phosphorylation in the AML proteome.
PMC8125016	R17000	To identify protein kinases differentially activated in the PRE-R and PRE-NR groups, we performed phosphorylation site motif analysis (IceLogo)
PMC8125016	R17002	We found basophilic RXXpS/pT and RPPS motifs characteristics of PRKCA/protein kinase C delta and dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2), respectively, in PRE-R patient samples when compared to the PRE-NR group (Figure 3d).
PMC8125016	R17003	Furthermore, the KSEA [44,45], which is based on phosphorylation FCs to estimate kinase’s activity, confirmed the higher activity of these kinases together with LIM domain kinase 1 and 2 and CDK2 in the PRE-R group (Figure 3e).
PMC8125016	R18000	CDK2 appeared to phosphorylate a large number of phosphosites in this dataset according to the KSEA search (e.g., PTPN2 S304, POLR2A S1920; stathmin 1, STMN1 S25, SRSF11 S207 and lamin A/C, LMNA S392).
PMC8125016	R18001	Only two kinases, protein kinase cGMP-dependent 2 (PRKG2) and microtubule affinity regulating kinase 1 (MARK1) involved in the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases in osteoblasts and cell polarity, respectively [64,65], were predicted to be more active in the PRE-NR group.
PMC8125016	R18002	The prediction of phosphorylation sites by a novel deep learning architecture based on multi-layer convolution neural networks (i.e., DeepPhos) installed in the piNET web platform [48,49] confirmed the higher number of activated kinases on substrates more phosphorylated in PRE-R patients when compared with the PRE-NR group (Figure S3) as previously observed in the KSEA analysis.
PMC8125016	R18003	Among them, cyclin dependent kinase 1 and 2, MAPK4 (displayed as ERK1 in the figure) and protein kinase C delta were again predicted to be more activated in the PRE-R group.
PMC8125016	R19000	The search of our phosphosite dataset by the kinase activation loop tool (see Materials and Methods) did not find any phosphorylated residue in the domain activation loops.
PMC8125016	R19001	However, we identified two kinases (in addition to the RIOK2 identified previously), CDK13 and pre-mRNA processing factor 4B (PRPF4B) more phosphorylated at S395 and S397 in PRE-NR and at S578 and S580 in PRE-R patients, respectively.
PMC8125016	R24001	Descending (cluster 5) and ascending (cluster 7) temporal proteomic profiles where enriched with chromatin binding/histone modification (e.g., HDAC2; CREB binding protein, CREBBP) and T cell receptor signaling pathway/proteasome complex (e.g., proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 11, PSMD11; proteasome 20S subunit alpha 2, PSMA2) GO terms, respectively (Figure 4a, right plot).
PMC8125016	R26001	Clusters with low protein expression in the non-responder proteome at 8D (cluster 1 and 2) were enriched with extracellular organelle (e.g., ras homolog family member A, RHOA; cell division cycle 42h, CDC42) and the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization GO terms, whereas clusters with high protein expression at 8D (cluster 3 and 4) were enriched with nucleic acid binding (e.g., high mobility group nucleosomal binding domain 2, HMGN2; DNA methyltransferase 1, DNMT1; lysine demethylase 2A, KDM2A) (Figure 5a, right plot).
PMC8125016	R26002	Clusters with the highest protein expression at 3D (cluster 5 and 6) were enriched with a nuclear part and RNA splicing (e.g., HNRNPC, HNRNPL and HNRNPK; SF1, SF3A2 and SF3A3) GO terms, whereas clusters with the lowest protein expression at 3D, cluster 7 and 8, were enriched with hydrolase activity/hydrolyzing O-glycosyl compounds and clathrin complex, respectively, when compared to pre-treatment and 8D conditions.
PMC8125016	R29001	Clusters corresponding to ten different response patterns were identified in the responder group; two of them with low site-specific phosphorylation at 8D (cluster 1–4) were enriched with RNA processing, mRNA splicing, via spliceosome (e.g., SRRM1/2; RNA binding motif protein 15, RBM15; serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2, SRSF2) and nuclear speck (e.g., SRSF1; RB binding protein 6, ubiquitin ligase, RBBP6) GO terms whereas clusters with high site-specific phosphorylation at 8D (cluster 5–7) were enriched with Rho GTPase binding, cytoplasmic mRNA processing body assembly and actin filament binding (Figure 6a, right plot).
PMC8125016	R29002	Clusters with high and low site-specific phosphorylation at 3D were enriched with the negative regulation of vasculature development/RNA polymerase I core binding (e.g., PML nuclear body scaffold, PML; programmed cell death 4, PDCD4; nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1, NOLC1) and cyclin/CDK positive transcription elongation (i.e., RB transcriptional corepressor 1, RB1; CDK12) GO terms, respectively.
PMC8125016	R31000	To identify protein kinases differentially activated in the temporal pair-wise comparisons we performed phosphorylation site motif analysis with WebLogo [43].
PMC8125016	R31001	We found the basophilic R/KXpS/pT and the SP motif characteristics of PRKCA/protein kinase C delta and MAPK3/1, respectively, in pre-treatment patient samples when compared to the 3D group (Figure 6c, left plot).
PMC8125016	R31002	Furthermore, the basophilic RRRSXpS/pT, the SP and the acidic SXD/ED/E motif characteristics of AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), MAPK3/1 and casein kinase 2 alpha 1 (casein kinase 2 alpha 1), respectively, were observed in the 8D when compared to the pre-treatment group (Figure 6c, middle plot).
PMC8125016	R32000	To briefly summarize the important observations from this part of our study, we observed again that the triple combination altered the phosphorylation of proteins, especially those involved in the regulation of translation/transcription/RNA metabolism, but additional effects were also observed for cytoskeletal/actin proteins and Rho GTPase binding.
PMC8125016	R33001	Clusters with an increasing temporal phosphorylation profiling (clusters 1 and 8), i.e., from PRE to 8D, in the non-responder phosphoproteome were enriched with cyclin dependent kinase activity (e.g., CDK1, CDK2, CDK11B, CDK12) and RNA splicing (e.g., DEAH-box helicase 16, DHX16) whereas clusters with a decreasing temporal phosphorylation profiling (clusters 2 and 5) were enriched with G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway (e.g., IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 2, IGGAP2; Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 7, ARHGEF7) and RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity (e.g., high mobility group protein HMG-I/HMG-Y and HMGA1) GO terms (Figure 7a, right plot).
PMC8125016	R34000	Clusters with the highest protein phosphorylation at 3D (cluster 3, 4 and 6) were enriched with RNA splicing, protein–DNA complex assembly (e.g., H1.4 linker histone, cluster member, H1-4; heterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3, HP1BP3; remodeling and spacing factor 1, Rsf-1, RSF1) and the sites of the DNA damage (e.g., replication timing regulatory factor 1, RIF1) GO terms, whereas clusters with the lowest protein phosphorylation at 3D (clusters 7, 9 and 10) were enriched with a negative regulation of the cellular catabolic process (e.g., PML, dyskerin pseudouridine synthase 1, DKC1), nuclear chromosome, telomeric region and the negative regulation of T cell activation (e.g., CD74 molecule, CD74; sialophorin, SPN) when compared to pre-treatment and 8D conditions.
PMC8125016	R35003	Several phosphosites on proteins belonging to the metabolism of RNA Reactome pathway (e.g., EIF4G1 S1188; tankyrase 1 binding protein 1, TNKS1BP1, S1666) showed higher phosphorylation at 8D of the ATRA–VP–TP treatment when compared to the pre-treatment condition.
PMC8125016	R35005	Phosphorylation at EIF4G1 S1188 by PRKCA induces binding to MAPK interacting serine/threonine kinase 1 (MKNK1), an interaction that has been linked to malignant transformation [67].
PMC8125016	R36000	The analysis of kinase substrates using the WebLogo tool found an enrichment of basophilic R/KXpS/pT and the SP motif characteristics of PRKCA/protein kinase C delta and MAPK3/1, respectively, in the 3D-NR and 8D-NR patient samples when compared to the pre-treatment group (Figure 7c, left and middle plot).
PMC8125016	R36001	The acidic SXD/ED/E kinase motif of CSNK2A1 was clearly observed in the 8D-NR when compared to the 3D-NR group (Figure 7c, right plot).
PMC8125016	R37000	Taken together, the non-responder group differed from the responders both with regard to the phosphorylation events on the actin/cytoskeleton but also with regard to transcriptional regulation and GTPase/G-protein coupled signaling.

PMC8396559	A00006	Moreover, the candidate genes and locus of the studied serum (vitamin D-binding protein, lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase, apolipoprotein E, etc.) and urine proteomic biomarkers (uromodulin, alpha-1-microglobulin, zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein, etc.) of MOH are presented in this review.
PMC8396559	D02001	Thus, lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase) is both a serum and urine proteomic biomarker.
PMC8396559	D02004	lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase is expressed in various tissues, such as the brain, retina, cochlea, and male reproductive organs, and it is found in different biological fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), ascites, seminal plasma, serum, urine, and amniotic fluid.
PMC8396559	D02005	Alongside hematopoietic-type PGDS (H-PGDS), lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase is related to a group of prostaglandin D synthases (PGDS) responsible for converting PGH2 to PGD2 [57], which is involved in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions, such as sedation, nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and PGD2-allodynia.
PMC8396559	D02006	In addition to synthesizing PGD2, a potent endogenous nociceptive modulator [58] within the cells, in the extracellular space and body fluids lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase binds various small nonsubstrate lipophilic molecules such as retinal, retinoic acid [59], bilirubin, biliverdin [60], gangliosides [61], amyloid β peptides [62].
PMC8396559	D02007	Therefore, lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase can potentially be a promising proteomic biomarker as the entire prostaglandin system plays a huge role in pain and central sensitization development.
PMC8396559	D03008	Moreover, by inhibiting nitric oxide (NO) synthase expression, vitamin D reduces the production of NO, a key endogenous mediator in headaches, such as migraine [70] and tension-type headaches [71], deficient levels of VDBP in MOH patients can be associated with a decreased level of vitamin D, which can be one of the mechanisms of chronic headache development.
PMC8396559	D05000	Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT), also known as alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, is an acute phase reactant and serine protease inhibitor (serpin) whose targets are elastase, plasmin, thrombin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasminogen activator, and is mostly produced in the liver and expressed by hepatocytes [76].
PMC8396559	D11004	However, some reports have suggested that AMBP may be involved in oxidant-scavenging and have enzymatic reductase properties as an antioxidant [84].
PMC8396559	D15000	Nonsecretory ribonuclease (RNAS2) is a pyrimidine specific nuclease with a slight preference for cytotoxin and helminthotoxin.

PMC8396559	R01001	Few studies have shown the potential biomarkers of headache chronicity caused by medication overuse, such as SNVs of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, brain-derived neurotropic factor, catechol-O-methyltransferase genes, altered neurotransmitters metabolism, neurophysiological and neuroimaging changes [27].
PMC8396559	R02000	Thus, Pellesi et al. (2019) showed the overexpression of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase) in the serum of MOH patients compared to healthy controls (219.2 ± 58.2 vs. 188.7 ± 39.2 ng/mL, p = 0.0038) and a not significant increase of apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) (49.8 ± 23.7 vs. 46.9 ± 17.5 μg/mL, p = 0.546).
PMC8396559	R02002	This finding of a higher level of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase in a serum shows that it may be the proteomic biomarker of headache chronicity associated with excessive intake of AHMs.
PMC8396559	R02003	It is interesting to note that according to the prevalent acute headache medication, patients who assumed mixtures had a higher serum level of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase compared to those who assumed NSAIDs or triptans (266.0 ± 44.6 vs. 214.9 ± 53.5 and 209.4 ± 57.5 μg/mL)
PMC8396559	R05001	Researchers have found seven proteins oversecreted by the kidneys in MOH patients, especially NSAIDs abusers, compared to healthy controls: uromodulin (UROM), alpha-1-microglobulin (AMBP), zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein (ZAZG), inter-alpha-trypsin heavy chain H4 (ITIH4), Ig kappa chain C region (IGKC), non-secretory ribonuclease (RNAS2), and cystatin C (CYTC) (OR = 49, 95% CI 2.53–948.67 vs. controls; OR = 11.6, 95% CI 0.92–147.57 vs. triptans and mixtures groups).
