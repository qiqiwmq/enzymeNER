PMC3208743	D06002	The increase in ChoCC has been associated with progressive alteration of membrane choline phospholipid metabolism during malignant transformation.62 It has been reported that the activity of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase D (PLD), the enzymes responsible for the degradation of phosphatidylcholine was higher in human mammary epithelial and epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines.62, 63 These findings suggest that both biosynthetic and catabolic pathways of the phosphatidylcholine cycle contribute to the accumulation of ChoCC in tumor tissues.

PMC3584211	D02000	This contention is corroborated by our observation that the protease mutant strain is more sensitive to AMPs.
PMC3584211	D02002	Herein, we show that extracellular proteases facilitate resistance to agents other than LL-37, as we observed increased sensitivity to both indolicidin and histatin-5.
PMC3584211	D03000	To further understand these findings, we performed FACS analyses using GFP-labeled variants of the wild-type and protease-null strain grown in human blood.
PMC3584211	D03001	After 4 h of incubation we observed increased phagocytosis of protease-null cells compared with the parental strain.
PMC3584211	D04000	We also observed significant influence of the secreted proteases on in vivo pathogenesis.
PMC3584211	D06000	In stark contrast to this, we in fact observe increased killing by the protease-null mutant when mortality was used as a measure of infection.
PMC3584211	D06001	This finding is of primary importance, and speaks strongly to a major role for the secreted proteases in controlling, and tightly regulating the infectious process.
PMC3584211	D06002	Herein, we show major increases in virulence-determinant stability upon inactivation of extracellular proteases.
PMC3584211	D06003	Specifically, we show that α-toxin, γ-hemolysin, PSMs, LukE, LukAB, PVL, and others are all more abundant in the protease-null strain.
PMC3584211	D07000	A major consideration with each of our phenotypic and growth-related studies is that the data presented may be skewed by elevated aggregation of the protease-null strain.
PMC3584211	D07001	It has previously been reported that secreted extracellular proteases have been shown to cleave surface and adhesive proteins by other groups (McGavin et al.
PMC3584211	D07003	Therefore it is reasonable to project that the protease-null strain may display elevated clumping compared with the parental strain, as we intimate above.
PMC3584211	D08000	Therefore, this presents a scenario where, in addition to their own, independent virulence-affecting roles, the secreted proteases exist as key check point enzymes to control the severity and intensity of infection via modulating the stability of other toxins and virulence determinants.
PMC3584211	D08001	Indeed, one could suggest that the regulatory control of secreted proteases by the agr system is no accident, but in fact evolutionary design.
PMC3584211	D09000	In summary, we demonstrate that the extracellular proteases of S. aureus play a variety of key roles in the virulence process.
PMC3584211	I02000	A number of studies have been conducted to determine the contribution of extracellular proteases to the disease process; however, many have been contradictory.
PMC3584211	I03000	In addition to these more general functions, S. aureus exoproteases have been shown to cleave specific host proteins.
PMC3584211	I03002	Secreted proteases can also cleave human α1-proteinase inhibitor (Potempa et al. 1986), the heavy chains of all human immunoglobulin classes (Prokesova et al. 1992), and elastin (Potempa et al. 1988), which aids in tissue invasion.
PMC3584211	I04000	Consequently, while there is a wealth of information on the role of secreted proteases in S. aureus disease causation, the specific role of these enzymes as virulence factors remains unclear.
PMC3584211	M00004	Once confirmed, this strain was used for the subsequent inactivation of sspAB, followed by scpA, using the pJB38 plasmids referred to above, and a protocol established for pKOR1 gene inactivation (Bae and Schneewind 2006).
PMC3584211	M05000	Phagocytosis of the wild-type and protease-null mutant was analyzed using pooled, whole human blood coupled with flow cytometry.
PMC3584211	M06000	Liquid cultures of LAC and its protease-null mutant were grown in Luria–Bertani (LB) media without NaCl.
PMC3584211	R00000	An extracellular protease-null strain of S. aureus has previously been generated and described in USA300 LAC (Wormann et al. 2011).
PMC3584211	R00001	As it forms the basis of the work described herein, we first set out to confirm the lack of secreted proteases in this strain using a targeted proteomics method.
PMC3584211	R01000	We first sought to assess whether loss of extracellular proteases affected viability of the USA300 LAC strain.
PMC3584211	R02000	We next set out to assess the fitness of the wild type and protease mutant during growth in a more pathogenically relevant medium, in this case pig serum.
PMC3584211	R03000	The specific mechanism by which the reduced viability of the protease-null strain in serum is mediated is unclear.
PMC3584211	R03007	Specifically, we observed a twofold decrease in protease-null cells compared with the parental strain at a concentration of 45 μg/mL, which increased to >fourfold at 65 μg/mL, and more than 7.5-fold at 85 μg/mL. Similar findings were observed with indolicidin, with a 2.5-fold decrease in viability observed for the mutant strain at 4 μg/mL, a more than sevenfold observed at 6 μg/mL, and >10-fold at 7 μg/mL. Finally, when these analyses were performed using histatin-5 we observed a >2.5-fold decrease in mutant viability at 3 μg/mL, a >8.5-fold at 5 μg/mL, and >11-fold at 6 μg/mL.
PMC3584211	R03008	Collectively, it is apparent that extracellular protease deletion results in heightened sensitivity of S. aureus cells to the effects of antimicrobial peptides; and that this observation is not limited to a single peptide example.
PMC3584211	R03009	As such, these findings strongly suggest that secreted proteases are a major mechanism by which S. aureus resists the toxic effects of AMPs.
PMC3584211	R04000	The in vitro AMP sensitivity assays suggest that extracellular proteases are important for survival during interaction with elements of the immune system.
PMC3584211	R04008	These strains were incubated under identical conditions to the whole human blood survival assay, before white blood cells were isolated and subjected to separation and analysis by FACS (Fig. 3).
PMC3584211	R05000	There are conflicting results regarding the role of extracellular proteases in S. aureus virulence (Coulter et al. 1998;
PMC3584211	R05005	Accordingly, 10 mice were subcutaneously inoculated with either the LAC wild type or protease-null mutant, and the infection was allowed to proceed for 6 days.
PMC3584211	R08008	Other well-known virulence determinants were also found to be more abundant in the protease-null strain, including two Lipases (Geh = 3.8-fold, SAUSA300_2603 = 2.5-fold), components of the γ-hemolysin (HlgA = 2.4-fold, HlgC = 2.1-fold), α-toxin (twofold), leukotoxin LukE (twofold), and enterotoxin Q (1.5-fold).

PMC3811377	M03000	Five hundred microliters of BAL fluid or a homogenate (02-542; Fisher Healthcare, Houston, TX) of 100 mg lung tissue in 2 ml of 0.9% NaCl was incubated with 500 μg/ml DNase I (10104159001; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Manheim, Germany) or DNase I buffer at 37°C for 10 min, followed by DNase I inactivation at 75°C for 10 min.

PMC3811377	R03002	In order to determine whether bacterial DNA quantified with qPCR corresponded to intact or dead bacteria, we treated samples with DNase I and followed this with heat inactivation before cell lysis as the initial step for sample DNA extraction; comparison of treated and untreated samples would determine the ratio of DNA from intact bacteria to that from total bacteria.
PMC3811377	R05000	To determine whether DNase I treatment directly results in bacterial death, we incubated S. aureus with DNase I and determined viability after incubation by dilution plating (Fig. 3C).
PMC3811377	R05001	DNase I treatment of S. aureus resulted in an increase of 15 to 20% in counts using the plate dilution method.
PMC3811377	R05004	We speculate that this effect could be caused by DNase improving individual cell dispersion prior to plating, perhaps by dissolving biofilms, but this does not seem to enhance bacterial growth.

PMC3882906	D03006	Interestingly, vascular injury and immune deregulation, which are both SSc hallmarks, are related to cell damage and deregulated apoptosis.66 Therefore, the association between SSc (especially ACA+ SSc) and the rs35677470 loss-of-function variant in DNASE1L3 might provide a link between a defective apoptotic DNA breakdown and the production of ACA.

PMC3943323	D03000	A number of findings indicate that this mechanism may be working in the generation of MP in TI patients: (i) HMC are contained in MP found in patients’ plasma or are released from TI-RBC in vitro; (ii) the degree of band 3 oxidation and phosphorylation in TI-RBC correlates with the amount of membrane-bound HMC; (iii) in TI-RBC and phenylhydrazine-treated RBC there was microscopy evidence that HMC are bound to protruding areas of the membrane that can be easily shed following moderate mechanical stress; (iv) in TI-RBC, Syk inhibitors diminished both band 3 phosphorylation and the rate of MP release; and (v) phenylhydrazine, which induces HMC formation in control RBC without directly oxidizing band 3, caused a Syk kinase-dependent release of MP accompanied by oxidation, phosphorylation and clustering of band 3.

PMC5426060	A02000	Three intronic variants located within DSE (dermatan sulfate epimerase) on 6q22 were associated with fast beta EEG at a genome wide significant level (p<5×10−8).
PMC5426060	R00000	Three highly correlated (i.e., in high linkage disequilibrium; r2 =1.0; D-prime=1.0 based on hg19 1000 Genomes from the CEU sample) intronic SNPs (rs10456907, rs13214667, rs2252790) located within DSE (dermatan sulfate epimerase) on 6q22 were associated with fast beta EEG at a genome wide significant level (p<5×10−8).
PMC5426060	R01000	Braineac indicates that rs2252790 is nominally associated with the mRNA expression of DSE/TSPYL1 (TSPY like 4), and ROS1 (ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase) in several brain regions.

PMC5511775	A00000	Remission induction therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) includes medications that may cause hepatotoxicity, including asparaginase.
PMC5511775	A00001	We used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify loci associated with elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) levels after induction therapy in children with ALL enrolled on St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (SJCRH) protocols.
PMC5511775	A00003	Adjusting for age, body mass index, ancestry, asparaginase preparation and dosage, the PNPLA3 rs738409 (C>G) I148M variant, previously associated with fatty liver disease risk, had the strongest genetic association with ALT (P = 2.5×10−8).
PMC5511775	D00000	Patients with ALL are at increased risk for the development of toxicities, including hepatotoxicity, which is partly reflected by elevated serum aminotransferase levels.(3)
PMC5511775	D02000	Patatin-like Phospholipase Domain Containing Protein 3 (PNPLA3 or adiponutrin) is a member of the family of patatin-like lipolytic enzymes involved in triacylglycerol metabolism and signaling.(23)
PMC5511775	D03000	We confirmed that asparaginase exposure in mice indeed led to an accumulation of hepatic lipids and neutral triglycerides (Figure S7).
PMC5511775	D03001	The results suggest that the mechanism of asparaginase-induced hepatotoxicity may be similar to that of hepatic steatosis, and may be attenuated by therapies that can mitigate hepatic triglyceride accumulation.
PMC5511775	D03002	These results may have particular implications for adults with ALL, in whom hepatotoxicity is common.(26) Interestingly, an early postmortem study from 31 pediatric ALL patients that received native E. coli asparaginase found that 87% had developed steatosis after exposure to asparaginase.(27)
PMC5511775	D06000	Although we think asparaginase was the most likely cause of post-induction ALT elevations in this study, we acknowledge that other elements of ALL induction therapy can also cause increases in ALT.
PMC5511775	D08000	In summary, we have identified that elevated post-induction chemotherapy ALT levels were likely due primarily to asparaginase, and we found that the same PNPLA3 I148M variant that was previously shown to be the most important determinant of NAFLD in a general population of adults is associated with drug-induced increases in serum ALT.
PMC5511775	I01000	Some treatment regimens for adults with ALL avoid using and/or dose modify asparaginase and high-dose methotrexate in order to minimize treatment-related hepatotoxicity,(8, 9) which may contribute to the lower cure rates for adults with ALL.
PMC5511775	I02000	We investigated coding and non-coding genetic variants associated with the elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) after remission induction therapy.
PMC5511775	M03000	During induction therapy, patients enrolled on the SJCRH Total XV or Total XVI protocols received asparaginase, prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and thiopurine (Table 1, Figure S9).(39, 40) Total XV patients received native E. coli asparaginase (Elspar) at 10,000 units/m2 IM, three times weekly for six doses and Total XVI patients received a single dose of PEGylated E. coli asparaginase (Oncaspar) at 3,000 units/m2 IV.
PMC5511775	M03001	Patients on Total XV with day 19 MRD ≥ 5% received three additional doses of native E. coli asparaginase over a week’s period, and patients on Total XVI with day 15 MRD ≥ 1% received an additional dose of PEGylated E. coli asparaginase (Table 1, Figure S9).
PMC5511775	M04000	During induction therapy, patients enrolled on COG AALL0232 received vincristine, daunorubicin, dexamethasone or prednisone, and PEGylated E. coli asparaginase.(43)
PMC5511775	M04001	Patients with day 29 MRD between 1% and 25% received extended induction consisting of additional doses of vincristine, daunorubicin, dexamethasone or prednisone, and PEGylated E. coli asparaginase.
PMC5511775	M04002	During consolidation, patients received cytarabine, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, mercaptopurine, and PEGylated E. coli asparaginase (Table S7).
PMC5511775	M07000	Male Balb/cJ mice (4-week-old) (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) received 1,500 IU/kg of PEGylated E. coli asparaginase by intraperitoneal injection twice weekly for 6 weeks.
PMC5511775	R00002	Patients enrolled on Total XV received mercaptopurine, whereas most on Total XVI received thioguanine; those on Total XV received pre-induction window therapy with methotrexate, whereas those on Total XVI did not (Table 1).
PMC5511775	R00003	In both protocols, patients with higher minimal residual disease (MRD) at day 15–19 of induction received additional asparaginase compared to those without.
PMC5511775	R01001	By univariate analysis (Table S1), treatment protocol (Figure 1A), additional asparaginase during induction (Figure 1B), race group (Figure 1C), age (Figure 1D), body mass index (BMI) percentile (Figure 1E), and gender were associated with post-induction ALT levels.
PMC5511775	R01002	In multivariate analysis (Table 3), higher ALT levels were associated with Total XVI treatment protocol (P = 0.041), receiving additional induction asparaginase (P = 2.7×10−4), non-black race (P = 8.7×10−13 for whites and P = 2.6×10−7 for Hispanics), older age (P = 1.4×10−6), and higher BMI (P = 2.9×10−3).
PMC5511775	R02000	To identify genetic variants associated with post-induction ALT levels in the SJCRH discovery cohort, we used a multivariate linear regression model including treatment protocol, use of additional asparaginase doses, percentage of Northern European ancestry, West African ancestry and Native American ancestry, age, and BMI percentile as covariates along with genotypes.
PMC5511775	R06000	Because the PNPLA3 variant rs738409 has been previously linked to elevated ALT levels and to the development of hepatic steatosis in the general population,(13) its association with elevated ALT after remission induction therapy suggested that asparaginase may influence blood ALT levels through dysregulation of hepatic lipids.
PMC5511775	R06001	We confirmed that PEGylated E. coli asparaginase caused hepatic steatosis in mice, as evidenced by a doubling in Oil-red O (ORO) staining in livers of mice treated with the drug compared to control (Figure S7).

PMC5994036	D02002	Alternatively, arginase activity may not elicit a significant effect on the RA pathogenesis per se, but may influence the induction of subclinical endothelial dysfunction in patients with RA.
PMC5994036	D02004	Interestingly, the disconnect was further supported by our observation that seronegative subjects had statistically significant elevated levels of SDMA and ArgMI compared with seropositive patients (Table ​(Table3),3), although the latter showed higher extraarticular disease manifestations.
PMC5994036	I01000	l-arginine is the common substrate of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginases [8].
PMC5994036	I01001	NOS catalyzes l-arginine to generate nitric oxide (NO) and l-citrulline, whereas arginases catalyze the conversion of l-arginine to l-ornithine and urea (Fig. 1a).
PMC5994036	I01002	Elevated arginase activity therefore can diminish the bioavailability of l-arginine by substrate competition and decrease NO production, which can lead to endothelial dysfunction [9, 10] and eventually result in adverse cardiovascular issues [11].

PMC5994036	R06001	Interestingly, elevated arginase activity did not show an association with traditional risk factors such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking.
PMC6019644	D04007	In light of evidence that antibodies against citrullinated protein and peptides (ACPA) precede the clinical onset of RA by several years, have high specificity for RA at over 95%24,25 and that we previously observed antibodies characteristic of RA, including citrullinated and uncitrullinated peptides of the RA autoantigens in individuals with periodontitis3, the ability of C.curtum to degrade arginine via the arginine deiminase pathway and to produce substantial amounts of citrulline is of particular interest.

PMC6193488	A00001	Platelets and coagulation proteases, interacting with circulating cells and in different vascular beds, modify several complex pathologies including atherosclerosis.
PMC6193488	A03000	Coagulation proteases, fibrin(ogen) and thrombus form ation: The role of factor (F) XI in thrombosis including the lower margins of this factor related to safe and effective antithrombotic therapy needs to be established; FXI is a key regulator in linking platelets, thrombin generation, and inflammatory mechanisms in a renin-angiotensin dependent manner; however, the impact on thrombin-dependent PAR signaling needs further study; the fundamental mechanisms in FXIII biology and biochemistry and its impact on thrombus biophysical characteristics need to be explored; the interactions of red cells and fibrin formation and its consequences for thrombus formation and lysis need to be addressed.
PMC6193488	A04001	The role of protease-activated receptor (PAR)-4 vis á vis PAR-1 as target for antithrombotic therapy merits study; ongoing trials on platelet function test-based antiplatelet therapy adjustment support development of practically feasible tests; risk scores for patients with atrial fibrillation need refinement, taking new biomarkers including coagulation into account; risk scores that consider organ system differences in bleeding may have added value; all forms of oral anticoagulant treatment require better organization, including education and emergency access; laboratory testing still needs rapidly available sensitive tests with short turnaround time.
PMC6193488	A05000	Pleiotropy of coagulation proteases, thrombus resolution and ischaemia-reperfusion: Biobanks specifically for thrombus storage and analysis are needed; further studies on novel modified activated protein C-based agents are required including its cytoprotective properties; new avenues for optimizing treatm ent of patients with ischaemic stroke are needed, also including novel agents that modify fibrinolytic activity (aimed at plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor.
PMC6193488	R113001	One promising drug candidate currently in phase II clinical studies for treatment of ischaemic stroke is the activated protein C (APC) variant 3K3A-APC.221 APC provides natural anticoagulant function by inactivating the coagulation cofactors Va and VIIIa.
PMC6193488	R120001	The standard of care for acute ischaemic stroke now involves IV alteplase (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator [tPA]) within 4.5 hours, followed by antiplatelet treatm ent (acetylsalicylic acid or clopidogrel) 24 hours after infusion of thrombolytics, to avoid excess risk of intracerebral haemorrhage.225,226 The major goal of thrombolytic treatm ent is to rapidly establish oxygenated blood flow to limit brain damage.
PMC6193488	R140000	Activated protein C mutants are increasingly interesting for their cytoprotective properties (e.g. in the management of patients with ischaemic stroke).
PMC6193488	R16002	C5 nevertheless is crucial for outer membrane phosphatidylserine exposure and activating TF prothrombotic activity, as previously also demonstrated for complement fixing antibodies causing thrombotic complications in stem cell therapy.51 Protein disulphide isomerase pathways are necessary for affinity maturation of TF and phosphatidylserine exposure but is not sufficient to render MV-associated TF fully prothrombotic.52 Complement-dependent release of MV from monocytes in LPS-stimulated whole blood produces TF which due to its high affinity is already in complex with its ligand FVIIa.

PMC6193488	R41001	In contrast to humans, mice have two kininogen genes and ablation of kininogen 1 (mkng1–/– mice) protects from experimental arterial thrombosis without causing bleeding.106 Consistently, a patient with plasma kininogen activity of less than 1% did not bleed.106 While serine proteases are targetable by small molecule inhibitors that bind into the enzymatic pocket, strategies for interference with HK or HK expression should be further investigated.
PMC6193488	R55000	Undertake further studies on FXI induced increased thrombin production and PAR-mediated cell signaling; these should consider upregulation of PK-mediated activation of the bradykinin pathways; population-based cohorts or large trials with anticoagulants should be explored for signals of blood pressure lowering effects or changes in incident CVD linked to FXI or other clotting protease activity.
PMC6193488	R89002	VKAs exert their anticoagulant effect by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase, which requires absorption from the gut into the systemic circulation, whereas NOACs are only partially absorbed from the gut and residual drug can exert effects locally on the GI mucosa leading to bleeding.174,179,182
PMC6247389	A00000	Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) and lipoprotein phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) may exert an important protective role by preventing the oxidative transformation of high- and low-density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL, respectively).
PMC6247389	A00005	Arylesterase, but not lactonase or Lp-PLA2 activities, was inversely associated with TD2M after adjusting for potential confounding factors such as age, sex, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, and lipoprotein subclasses (odds ratio = 3.389, 95% confidence interval 1.069–14.756).
PMC6247389	A00006	Marked difference between controls and T2DM subjects emerged from the analyses of the associations of the three enzyme activities and lipoprotein subclasses.
PMC6247389	A00007	Arylesterase was independently related with large HDL-C and small intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDL-C) in controls while, along with lactonase, it was related with small low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL-C, all IDL-C subspecies, and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) in T2DM (p < 0.05 for all).
PMC6247389	A00009	Our study showed that T2DM subjects have lower levels of PON1-arylesterase compared to controls and that T2DM occurrence may coincide with a shift of PON1 and Lp-PLA2 towards the more proatherogenic lipoprotein subclasses.
PMC6247389	C00000	In conclusion, the present community-based population study showed that PON1-arylesterase activity is inversely associated with T2DM.
PMC6247389	D00000	In overall agreement with previous reports [13, 14, 23], our study showed that PON1-arylesterase, but not PON1-lactonase or Lp-PLA2, activity was decreased in T2DM patients compared to controls.
PMC6247389	D00002	The subsequent analysis of the association between the enzyme activities and lipoprotein subclasses revealed that (1) Lp-pLA2 was associated with small LDL-C, large IDL-C, and VLDL-C in the T2DM group but not in controls and (2) arylesterase was associated only with large/medium HDL-C in controls and only with some of the more proatherogenic ApoB lipoproteins in T2DM subjects.
PMC6247389	D02000	One of the few certainties in this confusing landscape is the intimate interaction between the lipoprotein environment surrounding PON1 or Lp-PLA2 and their activities [9, 27, 42]; these two accessory proteins are anchored to lipids and some apolipoproteins which also coordinate and modulate their catalytic activity [43].
PMC6247389	D02001	Recent improvements in separation techniques have highlighted that PON1 and Lp-PLA2 have a preferential, but not exclusive, distribution within HDL or LDL subclasses [20, 21, 23, 26, 44].
PMC6247389	D02002	This may depend on the “broad” affinity of the enzymes with various apolipoproteins and lipid subspecies that may reach the most suitable combination in the small HDL3 in the case of PON1 and small LDL for Lp-PLA2.
PMC6247389	D03000	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated whether the inverse association between arylesterase and T2DM is independent from such large spectrum of lipoprotein subclasses.
PMC6247389	D04000	In order to address the possibility of influence of the diabetic state over the distribution of Lp-PLA2 and PON1 activities across lipoprotein subspecies, we assessed the simple and adjusted correlation coefficients separately in controls and T2DM subjects.
PMC6247389	D04001	The finding that Lp-PLA2 was associated to the small LDL-C, one of the most important risk factors of CVD, is consistent with some studies on isolated lipoproteins showing that in healthy people [51, 52] and, mostly, in diabetics [21], the enzyme is preferentially located in this LDL subclass.
PMC6247389	D04002	Failure in detecting a significant correlation of Lp-PLA2 with small LDL-C in controls may be the result of the low levels of this subclass in this group (Table 2).
PMC6247389	D04003	Alternatively, it can also be hypothesized that ApoB lipoproteins may be enriched in active Lp-PLA2 in T2DM patients and this could reflect in a further selective increase in proatherosclerotic potentials of these particles.
PMC6247389	D06001	Within this assumption, the lack of correlation between arylesterase and large/medium HDL-C in the T2DM group may be the result of the marked decrease in the concentration of these subclasses (Table 2) and, thus, of the fraction of PON1 complexed with these particles.
PMC6247389	D06002	On the other hand, the exclusive association of arylesterase and lactonase with large/medium IDL, small LDL, and VLDL among T2DM patients might simply reflect the concomitant increase in the levels of these lipoproteins.
PMC6247389	D07001	In T2DM patients, PON1 is still bound in HDL, as suggested by the strong correlation between arylesterase and total HDL-C, but most likely, it is more evenly distributed among the subspecies of this lipoprotein compared to controls.
PMC6247389	I04000	To address this still open question, the present population-based study sought to determine the link of T2DM with PON1 and Lp-PLA2 activities and, most importantly, to evaluate whether the disease might affect the distribution of these two enzymes across lipoprotein subclasses.
PMC6247389	M05000	Arylesterase and lactonase activities of PON1 and Lp-PLA2 activity in serum were measured by UV-VIS spectrophotometric assays in a 96-well plate format by using a Tecan Infinite M200 microplate reader (Tecan Group Ltd., Switzerland).
PMC6247389	M06000	Arylesterase activity was measured by using phenylacetate as substrate [31].
PMC6247389	M07000	Lactonase activity was assessed using gamma-thiobutyrolactone (TBL) as substrate, and Ellman's procedure was used to spectrophotometrically monitor the accumulation of free sulfhydryl groups via coupling with 5,5-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid)
PMC6247389	M08000	Lp-PLA2 was assessed by using 2-thio PAF as substrate, which is hydrolyzed by the enzyme in sn-2 position, and the consequent formation of free thiols was detected by Ellman's procedure.
PMC6247389	M11000	Since the distribution of arylesterase, lactonase, and Lp-PLA2 analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was skewed, the values were log transformed in order to approximate a normal distribution before being analyzed by parametric tests.
PMC6247389	R01000	Among the three serum enzyme activities assessed in this study, only PON1-arylesterase exhibited a significant change between groups.
PMC6247389	R01001	More specifically, as compared to controls, arylesterase was significantly (p < 0.001) decreased by 20% in participants with T2DM (78 ± 25 vs. 99 ± 31 kU/L) (Figure 1(a)).
PMC6247389	R01002	In contrast, either lactonase (p = 0.220) or Lp-PLA2 (p = 0.280) was not significantly different between the two groups (Figures 1(b) and 1(c)).
PMC6247389	R02000	In order to check whether the observed decrease in arylesterase activity was influenced by confounding factors of PON1 such as age and gender, we compared this activity between subgroups of 85 controls and 85 diabetics with similar age and prevalence of women/men (Supplementary Table 1).
PMC6247389	R02001	From this analysis, it emerged that the difference in arylesterase was less marked than that found in the whole sample (11%), but still significant (p = 0.003).
PMC6247389	R03000	The quantification of lipoprotein subfraction distribution was carried out on a subsample, Lipoprint, including 202 controls and 90 T2DM subjects, in order to (1) identify additional potential confounders of the association between arylesterase activity and T2DM and (2) explore the effect of T2DM on the distribution of PON1 activities and Lp-PLA2 on lipoprotein subclasses.
PMC6247389	R03002	Arylesterase, lactonase, and Lp-PLA2 activities also followed a similar trend, with only arylesterase showing a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in diabetics compared to controls (75 ± 20 vs. 96 ± 31 kU/L) (Supplementary Table 2).
PMC6247389	R05000	The above results along with the reports showing that PON1 reside in various lipoprotein subclasses [20, 23] prompted us to consider their relative serum concentration as possible confounders of the observed relationship between arylesterase and T2DM.
PMC6247389	R06000	We next performed multivariable logistic regression to evaluate whether the independent correlates of arylesterase that emerged from the previous analysis could influence the association between this activity and T2DM (Figure 2).
PMC6247389	R06001	This analysis showed that low arylesterase (i.e., activity level in the lower quartile) confirmed the inverse association between this activity and T2DM that emerged from between-group comparison (Figure 1(a)).
PMC6247389	R07000	To investigate the possible effect of T2DM on the distribution of PON1-arylesterase, PON1-lactonase and Lp-PLA2 across lipoprotein subclasses, we measured the correlation between these variables separately in both controls and T2DM subjects Table 4.
PMC6247389	R07003	The pattern changed among DM patients, where the correlations persisted for total cholesterol and HDL-C (p < 0.05 for both), small LDL-C (p < 0.05), all three IDL-C subclasses (p < 0.01 for all), and VDL-C (p < 0.01).

PMC6336684	D00000	In an effort to identify CXCR4 effector proteins involved in cellular migration and invasion, we performed SILAC proteomics analysis and identified PI4KIIIα as one of the proteins whose expression is tightly linked to CXCR4 in the prostate cancer cell line PC3.
PMC6336684	D00001	Here we have characterized the novel cross-talk between CXCR4 and PI4KIIIα, and revealed that both proteins localize to lipid rafts together, participating in cancer cell invasion.
PMC6336684	D00002	Our studies also conclude that CXCR4 does not directly bind PI4KIIIα, but interacts through PI4KIIIα adaptor proteins, EFR3 and TTC7.
PMC6336684	D00004	EFR3 and TTC7 interaction with PI4KIIIα is evolutionarily conserved (34, 35), where EFR3B is a peripheral membrane protein targeted to PM through a palmitoylated anchor (36), which interacts with soluble adaptor protein TTC7 bound PI4KIIIα.
PMC6336684	D00005	Structural studies demonstrate that TTC7 binds with both EFR3 and PI4KIIIα (26), and membrane anchored EFR3 serves as a docking site for this complex in PM.
PMC6336684	D00006	Binding studies demonstrate highly specific interaction between CXCR4 and both EFR3B and TTC7B (Figure 3 and ​and4).4).
PMC6336684	D01000	Among phosphatidylinositol 4 kinases, PI4KIIIα has been demonstrated to be critical for maintenance of PI4P pools in PM (23, 40), where it serves as a major precursor for the bulk of PI(4,5)P2 and, subsequently, for PI(3,4,5)P3.
PMC6336684	D02000	PI4KIIIα activity has been shown to be a critical determinant of plasma membrane identity by maintaining the levels of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2.
PMC6336684	D02001	Embryonic fibroblasts lacking PI4KIIIα showed impairment of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 production at plasma membrane and relocation of several of plasma membrane PI4P/PI(4,5)P2-binding proteins to internal compartments (35).
PMC6336684	D02002	Our data indicate that PI4KIIIα activity has additional functions in prostate cancer cells, where PI4P highly localizes to invasive projections in CXCR4 overexpressing cells thereby contributing to the invasiveness of cancer cells (Figure 5).
PMC6336684	D02003	In support of this hypothesis, we show that PI4KIIIα knockdown causes a sever defect in in vitro invasion without a significant alteration in cell proliferation.
PMC6336684	D02004	Our data from the cellular invasion assay also demonstrate that PI4KIIIα has a broader role on cellular invasion as its knockdown significantly inhibited multiple members of chemokine mediated PC3 cell invasion (Figure 7).
PMC6336684	D03000	In conclusion, in this study we assign a novel role of the chemokine receptors in recruiting PI4KIIIα activity for cancer cell invasion (Figure 7).
PMC6336684	D03001	By doing so, CXCR4 regulates PI4P production on the plasma membrane via interacting with cellular PI4KIIIα machinery.
PMC6336684	I01000	Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) phosphates (PIPs), or phosphoinositides (PIs), are cellular phospholipids phosphorylated at 3, 4 and/or 5 positions on the myo-inositol ring by several types of kinases specific to each position.
PMC6336684	I01009	The phosphatases, which dephosphorylate PIPs are fairly specific to each phosphate in the myo-inositol ring, and often localize to subcellular locations where their substrates are produced.
PMC6336684	I02000	In the present study we investigate the relationship between CXCR4 and PI4KIIIα activity in terms of biochemical characterization and consequences to cancer cell invasion and metastasis.
PMC6336684	M05000	In vitro PI4KIIIα lipid kinase assays were performed as described earlier (22).
PMC6336684	M05001	Post kinase assay the chloroform-extracted PI(4)P product was separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) in n-propanol-2M acetic acid (65:35 v/v).
PMC6336684	M05003	PI4KIIIα activity was set as one fold in control PC3 cells (PC3 scr and PC3 RFP) and compared with CXCR4 manipulated cells.
PMC6336684	M05004	In other prostate cancer cells PI4KIIIα activity was set as one fold in LNCaP cells and compared with activity of C4–2B and VCaP cells.
PMC6336684	M06001	Briefly, scr and PI4KIIIα siRNA transfected PC3 CXCR4 cells were cultured overnight in inositol-free cell type-specific medium and labeled for 24–48 h with 25 μCi/ml of myo-[2-3H] inositol in an inositol free medium following previously published protocols (32).
PMC6336684	M09000	CXCR4 overexpressing cells (~50% confluent) transfected with or without 100 nM PI4KIIIα siRNA for 6 hrs in duplicate 60-mm dishes were harvested 44 hrs later and seeded in 12 wells (1×104 cells/well) of a Cell-Bind 96-well, black culture plate in complete growth medium (RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin).
PMC6336684	R01000	To determine the significance of CXCR4 and PI4KIIIα association in lipid rafts, we first assessed whether CXCR4 regulates PI4KIIIα expression in prostate cancer cells.
PMC6336684	R01001	Data from Western-blotting experiments in CXCR4-overexpressing cells showed approximately a 2-fold increase in PI4KIIIα levels vs. the control PC3 parent cell line (Figure 2A,B).
PMC6336684	R01002	Concordantly, CXCR4 knockdown cells had reduced expression of both PI4KIIIα and Sac1expression.
PMC6336684	R01003	QPCR analysis of PI4KIIIα and Sac1 did not show changes in gene expresssion between parental PC3 cells and CXCR4 manipulated cells (Supplementary figure 3) suggesting a post-transcriptional mode of PI4KIIIα protein elevation in CXCR4 overexpressing PC3 cells.
PMC6336684	R01004	Cycloheximide treatment demonstrated that both CXCR4 and PI4KIIIα protein expression were decreased in PC3-CXCR4 cells compared to control PC3 cell which have lowere levels of both proteins; thus the overexpressed CXCR4 stabilizes PI4KIIIα in PC3 CXCR4 cells.
PMC6336684	R01005	The levels of both CXCR4 and PI4KIIIα in these cells were downregulated upon cycloheximide treatment in a similar fashion, further suggesting a post-transcriptional mode of their celllular regulation (Supplementary figure 4).
PMC6336684	R01006	Recent studies have indicated that CXCR4 signaling regulates the translational machinary involved in mTORC1 signaling (31), suggesting that PI4KIIIα overexpression could be due to a translational mechanism involving CXCR4/mTORC1 signaling.
PMC6336684	R01007	To identify whether the greater protein levels of PI4KIIIα is accompanied by elevated lipid kinase activity, we immunoprecipitated PI4KIIIα from prostate cancer cells with anti-PI4KIIIα antibody and subjected the immunoprecipitates to in vitro lipid kinase activity using PtdIns as a substrate.
PMC6336684	R01008	In vitro lipid kinase assays also confirmed that PI4KIIIα kinase activity was similarly elevated ~ 2 fold in the CXCR4-overexpressing cells and reduced in CXCR4 knockdown cells (Figure 2C and H).
PMC6336684	R01009	SiRNA mediated knockdown of PI4KIIIα resulted in a large downregulation of PI4KIIIα and small downregulation of Sac1 (Figure 2D) without a change in PI4KIIIβ expression (Supplementary figure 5) in PC3 cells.
PMC6336684	R01010	PI4KIIIα knock down experiments resulted in loss of PI4KIIIα lipid kinase activity (Figure 2E).
PMC6336684	R01011	Comparison of PI4KIIIα and Sac1 protein expression among three PC cell lines, namely, LNCaP, C42B and VCaP, by WB showed higher expression in VCaP cells compared to LNCaP cells (Figure 2F) and in vitro lipid kinase activity is also similarly higher in VCaP cells (Figure 2G).
PMC6336684	R01012	Comparision of PI4KIIIα expression and in vitro lipid kinase activity between the prostate cancer cells (LNCaP and C4–2B) and PC3 scr show that the latter have higher PI4KIIIα expression and in vitro lipid kinase activity (Figure 2A, F and H).
PMC6336684	R01013	VCaP cells which are TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive, where ERG factor was shown to regulate CXCR4 expression (17), had 3-fold higher PI4KIIIα lipid kinase activity vs. the other two PC cell lines (Figure 2G and H).
PMC6336684	R01014	The higher lipid kinase activity may be reflective of the more active state of the PI4KIIIα in VCaP cells, which may be dependent on the expression of accessory proteins which bind and translocate PI4KIIIα to the membrane.
PMC6336684	R02000	To further determine the role of PI4KIIIα activity in maintaining cellular PI4P levels, and the requirement of PI4P for the conversion to downstream PtdIns species, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, we monitored cellular PI profiles using our previously established procedures (32, 33).
PMC6336684	R02003	PtdIns profiles were significantly altered upon PI4KIIIα knockdown; as expected total PI4P levels were reduced suggesting the major role of PI4KIIIα in maintaining PI4P levels, whereas there is an unexpected increase in total PI(4,5)P2 levels.
PMC6336684	R02004	The minor PtdIns species PI(3,4)P2 was decreased whereas PI(3,4,5)P3 wasincreased (Table 1).
PMC6336684	R02005	These data suggest that PI4P synthetic processes in prostate cancer cells were complexly related with steady state levels of other PtdIns species, and knockdown of PM associated PI4KIIIα levels leads to significant alterations in the cellular PtdIns profiles.
PMC6336684	R03000	To further determine the mechanism of CXCR4 regulation of PI4KIIIα, first we determined whether the two proteins interact with each other.
PMC6336684	R03001	For this purpose, we performed tagged gene transfection followed by WB analysis; data show no direct interaction between PI4KIIIα and CXCR4 (Figure 3A).
PMC6336684	R03002	PI4KIIIα is localized to the inner plasma membrane through two adaptor proteins, EFR3B and TTC7B. EFR3B is a membrane bound protein and TTC7B is an adaptor protein which binds with both EFR3B and PI4KIIIα.
PMC6336684	R04000	To determine the functional significance of PI4KIIIα mediated CXCR4 regulation and its effect on cellular invasion, we determined PI4P localization in cells and performed in vitro cellular invasion studies.
PMC6336684	R05000	To determine the clinical significance of PI4KIIIα in prostate cancer progression, we extracted expression values for PI4KIIIα and Sac1 from NCBI data set GDS3289 of human PC tumor tissues.
PMC6336684	R05001	The analysis shows that PI4KIIIα expression is significantly higher and Sac1 is lower in PC metastasis compared to either localized PC or normal adjacent tissue (Figure 6A).
PMC6336684	R05002	No difference in the expression of either PI4KIIIα or Sac1 is found between low PIN and high PIN lesions in PC patients (Figure 6A).
PMC6345099	D04001	Except for Canavan disease, a genetic disorder characterized by toxic accumulation of N-acetyl aspartate caused by aspartoacylase inactivation (86), down regulation of this metabolite seems to be constant in clinical conditions that associate neuronal dysfunction, including epilepsy (87–89), multiple sclerosis (90), Alzheimer's disease (91, 92), schizophrenia (93, 94), stroke (95), brain injury (96, 97) and brain tumors (98, 99).

PMC6345099	D14000	The identification of estrogen metabolites and 17-ketosteroids in the urine of patients with PRL-secreting adenomas is most likely to be due to decreased activity of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 5α-reductase that occurs among these patients (66).

PMC6403054	I01000	The most useful biomarker to date, faecal calprotectin, has been shown to correlate with endoscopic and histopathologic remission with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 89%.9 It has been reported to predict relapse for those patients in remission, with both a sensitivity and a specificity of 69%.10 A number of other potential biomarkers have been proposed for UC including C-reactive protein11 levels in serum, along with myeloperoxidase12 and lactoferrin13 levels in faeces.
PMC6456665	R07001	Interestingly, they were harbored within more genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism: eight SNPs were located in seven carbohydrate metabolism genes including those encoding β-galactosidase, α-N-arabinofuranosidase, α-1, 2-mannosidase, rhamnulokinase, Rhamnogalacturonides degradation protein, β-galactosidase and D-lactate dehydrogenase (Table S9).
PMC6456665	R07002	These results may suggest an altered carbohydrate preference and a resulting different carbohydrate metabolism patterns in the gut bacteria of TB patients.

PMC6489687	A00004	Conclusion: These findings provide valuable insight into the distinct clinicopathological features of MBC and indicate that select serum proteomic markers may help improve MBC management.
PMC6489687	D03003	Consequently, high expression levels of ALDH directly correlate with poor clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer, since cancer stem cell s have been implicated in breast tumor initiation, metastatic spread and recurrence (19).
PMC6489687	D06000	Aromatase (CYP19A1) is responsible for the transformation of androgen precursors into estrogens.
PMC6489687	D07000	Finally, four proteins were detected only in the MBC group and not in the control samples: actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 4 (ARPC4), dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MP2K4), ectoderm-neural cortex protein 1 (ENC1), and matrix metalloproteinase-27 (MMP27).
PMC6489687	M05001	Aromatase ELISA kit was purchased from Fine Biotech (EH2665; Fine Test, Wuhan, Hubei, P. R. China).
PMC6489687	R02001	Serum aromatase (CYP19A1) concentrations in patients with MBC and healthy controls were measured using ELISA since CYP19A1 is an endoplasmic reticulum enzyme also detected in the serum.
PMC6498444	R09000	These 3 glycoside hydrolases predominantly originated from Prevotella copri (42 ± 11.1%, Figure S3B), supporting the hypothesis that loss of Prevotella strains following U.S. immigration drove loss of plant fiber degradation capability.
PMC6498444	R09001	We also observed a loss of GH5 and GH26 glycoside hydrolases from HmongThai to Hmong1st and U.S. controls, which indicates a loss of cellulose, beta-mannan and possible xyloglucan degradative potential.

PMC6507336	A00000	Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) is a Ser/Thr kinase that inactivates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase and serves a key role in aerobic glycolysis, which is a hallmark of cancer cells.
PMC6507336	M04006	The sections were washed in 1X PBS-T and incubated with 150 µl undiluted goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody with the EnVision System (Dako; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) for 1 h and the signal was developed with diamino-benzidine (Dako; Agilent Technologies, Inc.) for 5 min in the dark.

PMC6531881	D00000	Our results suggest that the number of rounds of PCR and to a lesser degree the choice of DNA polymerase impact the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data from bacterial communities.
PMC6531881	D01000	The observed sequencing error rates and alpha diversity metrics followed the manufacturers’ measurements of their polymerases’ fidelity (Fig. 1).
PMC6531881	D01005	However, in our experience and despite efforts to optimize the yield with the KAPA polymerase, the reactions typically had a high proportion of primer-dimer products and low yield of correctly sized products.
PMC6531881	D01007	Considering that polymerase development is an active area of commercial development with potential new polymerases becoming available, it is important for researchers to understand how changing the polymerase impacts downstream analyses for their type of samples.
PMC6531881	D03001	Beyond the imperfections of the best polymerases, sometimes difficult to lyse organisms require stringent lysis steps and low biomass samples require additional rounds of PCR.
PMC6531881	I02000	The influence that the choice of DNA polymerase has on the formation of PCR artifacts has not been well studied.
PMC6531881	I02001	There has been recent interest in how the choice of the hypervariable region and data analysis pipeline impact the sequencing error rate (15, 18,–20); however, these studies use the same DNA polymerase in the PCR step and implicitly assume that the rate of nucleotide misincorporation from PCR are significantly smaller than those from the sequencing phase.
PMC6531881	I02002	There has been more limited interest in the impact that DNA polymerase choice has on the formation of chimeras (23, 38).
PMC6531881	I02003	A recent study found differences in the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and chimeras between normal and high fidelity DNA polymerases (38).
PMC6531881	I02004	The authors of the study reduced the difference between two polymerases by optimizing the annealing and extension steps within the PCR protocol (38).
PMC6531881	I02005	Yet this optimization was specific for the community they were analyzing (i.e., captive and semicaptive red-shanked doucs) and assumed that if the two polymerases generate the same community structure that the community structure was correct.
PMC6531881	I03000	This study investigated the impact of choice of high fidelity DNA polymerase and the number of rounds of amplification on the formation of PCR artifacts using a mock community and human stool samples.
PMC6531881	I03002	We tested (i) the effect of the polymerase on the error rate of the bases represented in the final sequences, (ii) the fraction of sequences that appeared to be chimeras and the ability to detect those chimeras, (iii) the bias of preferentially amplifying one fragment over another in a mixed pool of templates, and (iv) intersample variation in community structure of samples amplified with the same polymerase across the amplification process.
PMC6531881	I03003	To characterize these factors, we sequenced a mock community of 8 organisms with known sequences and community structure and human fecal samples with unknown sequences and community structures.
PMC6531881	M02000	Five high fidelity DNA polymerases were tested, including AccuPrime (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), KAPA HIFI (Roche, IN, USA), Phusion (New England Biolabs, MA, USA), Platinum (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and Q5 (New England Biolabs, MA, USA).
PMC6531881	M03000	Each PCR condition (i.e., combination of polymerase and number of rounds of PCR) was replicated four times for the mock community and one time for each fecal sample.
PMC6531881	R04000	With the exception of the sequence data generated using the KAPA polymerase, the ratios of the two Salmonella enterica V4 sequences from the mock community were lower than the expected ratio of 6:1.
PMC6531881	R05000	Because the variation in bias between polymerases and across rounds of PCR could be artificially inflated due to sequencing errors and chimeras, we analyzed the alpha and beta diversity of the mock community data at different phases of the sequence curation pipeline (Fig. 4).

PMC6562671	C00000	A polysaccharide lyase AlyP1400, with high activity against alginate substrate, has been purified from marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. 1400.
PMC6562671	C00001	This enzyme had a molecular mass at 23 KDa and revealed a broad pH range for high enzyme activity and thermo-stability with a bifunctional lyase activity for both poly-M and poly-G degradation.
PMC6562671	C00002	AlyP1400 efficiently diminished P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilms when combined with conventional antibiotic, as the biofilm thickness, biovolume and surface area were reduced after treatment with carbenicillin or ciprofloxacin combined with the lyase enzyme.
PMC6562671	D01000	Recently, alginate lyase activity received much attention, because the alginate enzymatic degradation expands the potential application of this polysaccharide, not only through the industrial applications, but also for curing life threatening infections
PMC6562671	D01002	Extracting alginate lyase enzymes from marine bacteria that possessed alginate depolymerization activity could shift chronic infection treatment strategies.
PMC6562671	D01004	This is due to the alginate lyase activity, which degrades the alginate to un-saturated uronic acid-containing oligosaccharides via β-elimination of 1,4-glycosidic [42,43].
PMC6562671	D01005	Targeting mucoid biofilms with the alginate lyase enzymatic activity can reduce viscosity in clinical strains, and in CF specimens, thereby increasing the phagocytosis activities and enhance the antipseudomonal antibiotics’ effects.
PMC6562671	D02000	Using the purified alginate lyase of Pseudoalteromonas sp. 1400 under static and dynamic conditions against P. aeruginosa biofilms on polystyrene and glass surfaces, it was revealed that AlyP1400 impaired biofilm development, compared to the non-treated biofilms and led to subsequent biofilm detachment.
PMC6562671	I03002	[29], DNase (NucB) that hydrolyzes the eDNA within the extracellular matrix [30], and glycoside hydrolase that hydrolyzes the biofilm exopolysaccharide [31] have all been shown to act against P. aeruginosa biofilm.
PMC6562671	I03003	The overproduction of the polysaccharide alginate is the major cause for the mucoid phenotype of P. aeruginosa that is associated with a decline in lung function.
PMC6562671	M02001	(GPS coordinates: 44°38′05.3″N 64°01′40.6″W) at 22.5 °C and pH 8.11, were used for culturing bacterial isolates with alginate lyase activity, as follows: 10 ml water was shaken in 90 ml enrichment medium (0.5% peptone, 0.1% yeast extract, 0.5% sodium alginate, 3% NaCl, pH 6.5)
PMC6562671	M05000	Bacterial colonies with the highest lyase activity in the clear zone assay above (4.2) were selected for testing their alginolytic activity as follows: three milliliter overnight (16–18 h) bacterial culture (OD at 600 nm adjusted to 1.0) was inoculated into a 97 mL fermentation medium (selection medium with 1.8% sodium alginate) and incubated at 28 °C and 150 rpm for 24 h. After the fermentation and centrifugation for 30 min at 12,096× g at 4 °C, cell-free supernatants were filtered through 0.22 µm non-pyrogenic filters and kept at −20 °C.
PMC6562671	M07000	Alginate lyase activities were measured using an absorbance assay at the wavelength of 235 nm.
PMC6562671	M07001	The absorbance of sodium alginate solution was increased due to the formation of a carbon-carbon double bond at the end of the product generated from lyase-mediated cleavage of alginate.
PMC6562671	M10000	In order to extract sufficient quantities of lyase, we cultured isolate 1400 under different temperatures, covering the range of 10–45 °C, and pHs, covering the range of 4.0–10 in order to determine the optimum culture conditions to purify the enzyme.
PMC6562671	M10001	Both the total and specific alginate lyase enzyme activities were measured as described by Zhu and colleagues [59], and the temperature and pH resulting in the highest enzyme activities were utilized for the following purification procedures.
PMC6562671	M11000	Alginate lyase thermo-stability was determined by incubating the purified enzyme 60 µg protein/mL with sodium alginate (0.1%) in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) at different temperature (10–45 °C).
PMC6562671	M12000	The purified alginate lyase was resolved on a 10% SDS separating gel using the SDS-PAGE analysis.
PMC6562671	M15000	After confirming PA14 alginate production and AlyP1400 alginate lyase activity on the alginate, the inhibitory effects of AlyP1400 with and without antibiotics was assessed against established biofilms formed in dynamic conditions.
PMC6562671	R00000	A total of 36 bacterial strains with alginate lyase activity were isolated after enrichment on bacterial agar plates containing sodium alginate and selected for 16S rRNA sequencing (GenBank accession numbers MK377259 through MK377294).
PMC6562671	R00009	The cell-free supernatant of medium that had been used to culture this strain contained a total alginolytic activity of 70.09 ± 1.72 U/mL (Figure 1a) and significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced sodium alginate solution viscosity to 2.23 ± 0.25 centipoise with 90.81% liquefaction after 24 h incubation (Figure 1a), while sodium alginate solution (the blank) viscosity was 24.28 ± 1.12 centipoise (Figure 1b).
PMC6562671	R00011	After covering the alginate agar plate with 1 M CaCl2 solution, enzymes acting on poly-mannuronate (poly-M) will show a white halo due to gelation of the degradation products caused by the reaction of lyase with poly-M. Meanwhile, poly-guluronate (poly-G) substrate will show a white ring, due to the depolymerization of alginate to uronic acid.
PMC6562671	R02000	Isolate 1400 was selected for subsequent enzyme purification and characterization because it demonstrated the best and highest alginate lyase activity as shown by having the largest clearance zone (Table 1) and enzyme production measured in U/mL (Figure 1a).
PMC6562671	R02001	First, we set to optimize the growth conditions (including temperature and medium pH), under which Pseudoalteromonas sp. 1400 produced the highest alginate lyase activity in the supernatant.
PMC6562671	R02006	On the other hand, Pseudoalteromonas sp. 1400 grown at pH 8.0 released the highest amount of alginate lyase with specific activity of 32.85 U/mg protein and 56.5 ± 0.71 U/mL total activity, whereas we noticed that the lowest specific enzyme activity (5.92 U/mg protein) was recorded at pH 5.0 and pH 6.0.
PMC6562671	R03000	Based on the optimal alginate lyase production conditions, we set to purify this enzyme (AlyP1400) from Pseudoalteromonas sp.
PMC6562671	R04001	During the first 120 minutes of purification time, no lyase activity was observed with the collected fractions through the bio-gel column chromatography eluate with 0.2 M sodium chloride.
PMC6562671	R05000	AlyP1400 was active for both poly-M and poly-G degradation, indicating that it is a bifunctional alginate lyase (data not shown).
PMC6562671	R06000	The AlyP1400 band identified in the SDS-PAGE with alginate lyase activity was excised, subjected to trypsin digestion and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
PMC6571926	D03000	Formation of GTP-derived urinary metabolites: Absorbed EGC, either directly from the GTP supplement, or from the hydrolysis of EGCG, likely underwent COMT-mediated methylation followed by uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)-mediated glucuronidation to form methyl epigallocatechin glucuronide (Vu).
PMC6571926	D03001	Similarly, absorbed EC was metabolized by COMT-mediated methylation and sulfotransferase (SULT)-mediated sulfation reactions to form methyl epicatechin sulfate (IVu).
PMC6585303	R13000	To investigate for a special immune relationship in patients with SLE with their candidate pathobionts, we electrophoretically separated the components in extracts of eight monocultured RG strains (online supplementary table 5) after treatment with lysozyme and endonuclease.
PMC6585303	R13001	Immunoblots revealed that many patients with lupus and healthy adult controls had IgG reactivity with antigenic bands, common to a range of RG strains (figure 2A–D), and these were protease-sensitive (figure 2E).
PMC6585303	R24000	For investigations of the potential immune epitope features of the RG2 strain, we performed immunoblots with lupus IgG that detected high levels of oligomeric bands in the LG3 pool in the range of ~20–30 kDa protein markers, which resembled the reactivity pattern of protease-resistant antigens in the RG2 extract that were absent in other RG strains (figure 4A–D).

PMC6815137	D07003	This finding is consistent with previous studies implicating high CTSB and CTSL protein abundance in aggressive ovarian cancers; however, no previous studies have probed protease activity or tumor compartment-specific activity (37–39).
PMC6815137	D07004	The relatively high activity in the primary tumor site is in agreement with the roles of microenvironment remodeling factors and proteases during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in primary metastatic tumors (40), and also could be related to microenvironmental conditions in the primary tumor that may promote the activity of these enzymes.

PMC7005843	M12000	Heme oxygenase and transport genes define another strategy that microorganisms, especially pathogens, use to obtain iron from their environment.
PMC7005843	M12001	In particular, heme oxygenases enable pathogens to obtain iron from a host through oxidative cleavage of heme, thereby releasing iron (Wilks and Heinzl, 2014).
PMC7005843	M12002	Heme oxygenases are categorized into two groups: (1) “canonical” heme oxygenases (HmuO, PigA, and HemO), which degrade heme to biliverdin and carbon monoxide, and (2) “non-canonical” heme oxygenases (IsdG, IsdI, MhuD, and Isd-LmHde), which degrade heme to products like staphylobilin (IsdG and IsdI) and mycobilin (MhuD) (Wilks and Heinzl, 2014).

PMC7344724	D02004	Deletion of fmpE in A. fumigatus resulted in reduced growth and sporulation of the mutant strains but virulence was not altered as compared to the WT strain in a murine infection model [35].
PMC7344724	I03000	Statins are widely used for the control of cholesterol and act by inhibiting the action of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-Co A) reductase and thus block cholesterol biosynthesis [13,14].

PMC7542363	A00001	However, pathogenic, and commensal bacteria have evolved specific glycoproteases that overcome the steric impediment posed by carbohydrates, cleaving glycoproteins precisely at their glycosylation site(s).
PMC7542363	D00002	However, there is growing evidence that bacterial pathogens and commensals have evolved specific proteases that overcome the steric impediment posed by carbohydrates and indeed use glycans as recognition determinants to cleave glycoproteins right at the glycosylation site.
PMC7542363	D00006	Our MS analysis of proteolytic fragments resulting from glycoprotein treatment with CpaA revealed that CpaA has a consensus target sequence consisting of a Pro residue followed by a glycosylated Ser or Thr (P-S/T), which is unprecedented for bacterial glycoproteases.
PMC7542363	I03000	Few glycoprotein-targeting zinc metallo-endopeptidases have been structurally characterized.
PMC7542363	I03001	They belong to either the metzincin or gluzincin protease superfamilies (16, 17).
PMC7542363	I03002	Metzincin proteases have a characteristic extended zinc-binding motif (HEXXHXXGXXH) and a conserved Met turn, whereas gluzincin proteases have a glutamate residue in the zinc-binding motif (HEXXHE) (18).
PMC7542363	I03006	Interestingly, these repeats share fold similarities to a domain present in the metzincin protease StcE, a secreted glycoprotease from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), though their detailed sequence and structural similarities are very limited (13, 20).
PMC7542363	R01000	The activity of glycoproteases is differentially impacted by many factors, such as O-glycosylation density and glycan composition.
PMC7542363	R01001	For instance, StcE and TagA, a secreted glycoprotease from Vibrio cholerae, uniquely cleave heavily glycosylated proteins, such as mucins, but they cannot digest less O-glycosylated proteins, such as fetuin (Ft).
PMC7542363	R02001	(A) CpaA does not cleave either exclusively N-glycosylated protein RNaseB or unglycosylated proteins such as RNaseA and BSA.
PMC7542363	R02002	RNase A contains traces of RNase B. RNase B, RNase A, and BSA were incubated with and without purified CpaA. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE.
PMC7542363	R03000	The activity of various glycoproteases can be dependent on, inhibited by, or unaffected by the presence of sialic acid, a negatively charged 9-C sugar with key biological functions (34).
PMC7542363	R03001	For example, glycoproteases from Mannheimia haemolytica and Clostridium perfringens require sialic acid for activity, whereas other glycoproteases are inhibited by this sugar (16, 35, 36).
PMC7542363	R03002	StcE is an example of a glycoprotease that is indifferent to sialic acid (22).
PMC7542363	R04003	Together, these results indicate that CpaA possesses broad substrate specificity, being able to cleave multiple O-glycosylated proteins in addition to fV and fXII, and that CpaA activity is unaffected by sialylation.
PMC7542363	R21000	Mounting evidence indicates that both commensal and pathogenic species produce and secrete glycoproteases to modulate adherence, penetrate the inner mucus layer, or evade the host immune response (18, 21, 47).
PMC7542363	R22000	Due to low amino acid sequence conservation, it is not possible to differentiate proteases from glycoproteases solely on the basis of primary amino acid sequence.
PMC7542363	R22004	Thus, even if structural analyses identify putative glycan-binding domains in a protein of interest, it is difficult to predict the specific substrates targeted by the putative glycoprotease.
PMC7677002	D05006	Furthermore, Venn and network analyses showed no interactions between the DEG and downregulated genes (Fig. 11C and ​andD),D), and they suggest that citral does not affect the normal growth and metabolism of A. baumannii.
PMC7677002	M22000	For catalase activity, after electrophoresis, the gel (8%) was washed three times with 50 mM KPi buffer.
PMC7677002	M26000	The extracellular lipase production of control and citral-treated A. baumannii was assessed using p-nitrophenyl palmitate (pNPP) as the substrate.
PMC7677002	M27000	The proteolytic activity of A. baumannii control and citral-treated samples was analyzed by mixing 100 ml of a protease substrate solution (0.2% azocasein dissolved in 0.05 M Tris-hydrochloride) with 100 ml of the CFCS of A. baumannii samples, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 30 min.
PMC7677002	R13000	Native PAGE was performed to assess the effect of citral on catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) production in A. baumannii.
PMC7677002	R13001	The band intensity was reduced for catalase (Fig. 13A) and SOD (Fig. 13B) in citral-treated samples compared to the control samples.
PMC7677002	R15000	Bacteria produce extracellular lipase as a virulence factor.
PMC7677002	R15001	In this study, the effect of citral on lipase production by A. baumannii was investigated.
PMC7677002	R15002	Citral reduced lipase production by 70% compared to control cells (Fig. 13D).
PMC7805185	D04000	In terms of host factors, we focused on human protease inhibitors and immunoglobulins.
PMC7805185	D04001	Generally, intestinal protease activity increases in IBD and protease inhibition has been proposed as new therapeutic strategy for IBD
PMC7805185	D04003	In our analysis, we found human endogenous protease inhibitors such as Serpins A1 significantly increased in IBD (particularly CD) fecal and MLI samples (Additional file 1: Fig.
PMC7805185	D04004	S7a), probably because the increased protease activity triggers the production of a higher level of protease inhibitors in order to control the destructive nature of protease.
PMC7805185	R09000	At enzyme level, 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, which is involved in butyrate metabolism, showed the highest NRASP (median value > 3), followed by 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase involved in fatty acid beta-oxidation, glycine C-acetyltransferase involved in L-threonine degradation, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ATP) involved in gluconeogenesis, ketol-acid reductoisomerase (NADP(+)) involved in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), and superoxide dismutase involved in tolerance to oxidant stress (median NRASP of 2–3, Fig. ​Fig.22c).
PMC7805185	R14005	To further investigate the effect of host factors on gut microbial proteolysis, we also analyzed the correlations between gut microbial proteolysis pattern and host immunoglobulins.
PMC7805185	R14006	IgG1, IgG4, and IgM were negatively correlated with PCo1 (− 0.44
PMC7821334	A00000	Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Q (PTPRQ) was extracted from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with probable idiopathic normal‐pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) by proteome analysis.
PMC7821334	A04000	Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Q (PTPRQ) extracted from CSF of patients with probable idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) by proteome analysis was evaluated as potential biomarker for this condition.
PMC7821334	I02000	Recently, protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Q (PTPRQ) was extracted from the CSF of patients with iNPH by proteome analysis.
PMC7821334	M14000	Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Q staining was viewed under an E800 microscope (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan), and images were captured with an AxioCam HRc CCD camera using AxioVison Rel 4.7.2.0 imaging processing software (Carl Zeiss, Microimaging GmbH, Jena, Germany).
PMC7928900	A00006	Since lungs are the primary infection site, we integrate human lung gene expression profile along with the host regulatory network to demonstrate the altered host signalling mechanism in viral infection.
PMC7928900	D03004	The clinical outcome of ARDS has now well supported by the reports from patients with COVID-19 disease severity, observed with increased interleukin (IL)-2, IL-7, macrophage inflammatory protein 1-α, interferon-γ inducible protein 10, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, ferritin and tumor necrosis factor-α levels, resulting from viral induced hyperinflammation (Huang et al. 2020).
PMC7928900	R02002	Besides this, molecular function such as type 1 angiotensin receptor binding (AGTR1), G-protein coupled receptor, insulin receptor, ribonucleotide, chemokine and cytokine receptor binding were observed to be altered by the modulation in the regulatory network.
PMC8021180	D04001	One of the most represented groups of proteins we found in the egg proteome were those related to energy and metabolism and included proteins associated with glycolysis (enolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), gluconeogenesis (triosephosphate isomerase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase GTP) and other metabolic enzymes such as alpha-1,4 glucan phosphorylase and malic enzyme (S1 Table).
PMC8021180	D06002	The Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn-SOD) was found in the EE proteome (S1 Table) and has also been identified on the adult surface and larval extracts (secreted and somatic) of Toxocara canis [38], in the somatic extract of adults of Fasciola hepatica, and the S. mansoni egg secretome
PMC8021180	D13000	We identified certain glycolytic enzymes such as enolase and GAPDH, as immunoactive components of the T. trichiura EE and FE.
PMC8021180	D13002	Furthermore, enolase plays a vital role in the degradation of the intracellular matrix through the activation of plasminogen facilitating the invasion, migration, and fixation in the host [15,17,33,44] all essential mechanisms to ensure T. trichiura prolonged survival.
PMC8021180	R08000	Analysis of band 2W identified poly-cysteine and histidine-tailed protein isoform 2 (PCHTP-2), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), actin, actin 5C, enolase, and epididymal secretory protein E1 (Table 2) and confirmatory analysis with LC-MS/MS also indicating there were other proteins present such as phosphoglycerate kinase, the dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase 48 kDa subunit, adenosylhomocysteinase, tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen, calponin domain containing protein, 3 ketoacyl coenzyme A thiolase, elongation factor 1-alpha and serpin domain containing protein (Table 3) while actin 5C and epididymal secretory protein E1 were not confirmed.
PMC8036917	M04001	Samples were lysed for 45 min at 4 °C in a lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.002% NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% BSA, and phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland).
PMC8036917	M04002	Lysates containing the Laemmli buffer and 5% β-mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were size-separated in 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman-Protan, Dassel, Germany).
PMC8036917	R02003	MPN RBC samples treated ex vivo with ruxolitinib displayed high PS exposure levels measured by flow cytometry, with an average of 19% PS-positive RBCs (range: 10–30%) compared to DMSO-treated cells (15% PS-positive RBCs, range: 8–28%, p = 0.0005) (Figure 3B,C), suggesting the import of ruxolitinib into the RBCs.
PMC8045895	A00000	Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) enzyme has antioxidative properties and is present in mammalian blood and several other body fluids.
PMC8045895	A00004	The PON1 enzyme activities measured with different substrates tend to be falsely assumed as being equivalent in the literature, although there are poor or weak correlations among the PON1 enzyme activities with different substrates.
PMC8045895	A00005	In addition, and despite our knowledge of the factors influencing PON1 paraoxonase and arylesterase activities, there is little knowledge of PON1 lactonase activity variations and attendant mechanisms.
PMC8045895	A00011	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-omics analysis of PON1 lactonase activity with an eye to future applications in basic life sciences and translational medicine and the nuances of critically interpreting PON1 function with lactones as substrates.
PMC8045895	C00000	Paraoxonase activity, with the eponymous substrate, and arylesterase activity, with phenlyacetate as a substrate, had been used to characterize serum PON1 since the 1980s.
PMC8045895	C00001	Lactonase activity measurements only began to be used in the mid-2000s, after a series of articles, which suggested that lactonase is the native activity of PON1 and which launched several promising artificial lactone substrates of PON1 (Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2006).
PMC8045895	C01000	Measuring PON1 lactonase activity has always been sidelined by paraoxonase and arylesterase activities.
PMC8045895	C01002	All the studies in question included at least one substrate for paraoxonase activity and at least one for arylesterase activity; however, the authors of the meta-analysis could not find a single study in which a lactone substrate would be tested.
PMC8045895	C04001	Clinical researchers should also include measurements of lactonase activity in future PON1 studies, and studies carried out before 2000 would benefit from a remake with lactone substrate participation.
PMC8045895	C06000	(3) Researchers focusing on PON1 lactonase activity in humans are advised to conduct genotyping as well.
PMC8045895	C07000	(4) When investigating the association of PON1 lactonase activity, and other PON1 activities, with specific medical conditions, it is advisable to account for other comorbidities, especially the ones that have been associated with PON1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	C08000	(5) More generally, the different multi-omics factors that can influence PON1 lactonase activity should be kept in mind by researchers.
PMC8045895	C09000	This study contributes to better understanding of the associations among all three PON1 enzyme activities and different diseases/conditions while highlighting the importance of measuring lactonase activity in clinical studies.
PMC8045895	I00000	Numerous articles have been published in the last decades about serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1), an enzyme found in different mammal species and other animals, including fishes, amphibians, and birds, and its association with various medical conditions in humans.
PMC8045895	I02000	The three main activities of PON1 are aryldialkylphosphatase, more commonly known as paraoxonase activity, arylesterase and lactonase activity (Harel et al., 2004).
PMC8045895	I03000	Paraoxonase activity is unlikely to be a native activity of PON1, as organophosphates are uncommon in nature (Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2005; Metcalf and Bruno, 2016).
PMC8045895	I03001	Structure-reactivity studies suggest that the primary function of PON1 in terms of evolutionary development is lactonase activity (Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2005).
PMC8045895	I03002	Especially paraoxonase activity is often poorly correlated with the other two enzymatic activities (Gugliucci et al., 2015; Kowalska et al., 2018; Martinelli et al., 2013; Romani et al., 2009; Rosenblat et al., 2006).
PMC8045895	I04000	An extensive review on paraoxonase and arylesterase activities has already been published (Dardiotis et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	I04001	However, the literature lacks analyses on PON1's native (lactonase) activity.
PMC8045895	I05000	In this analysis, we also examine and synthesize the associations between various medical conditions and the lactonase activity of PON1.
PMC8045895	I05001	As PON1 has antioxidative activity, its lactonase activity may be correlated with oxidative stress- and inflammation-related diseases, primarily those associated with aging.
PMC8045895	I06000	Most of the research on PON1 lactonase activity has been performed on humans; however, some research groups also investigated lactonase activity in mice, rats, and cows (Farid et al., 2013;
PMC8045895	R03000	Two different articles provided numbers for the percentage of variation of activity that is explained by each of the main parameters, such as genetic variations and sex, affecting PON1 lactonase activity (Quillen et al., 2012; Rainwater et al., 2009).
PMC8045895	R05003	It was shown that low levels of Linc-OIP5 correspond to lower levels of PON1 expression and lactonase activity, whereas high levels of miR-616 gene expression had the opposite effect and decreased PON1 expression and lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R08000	A similar analysis was carried out investigating the effect of in vitro homocysteinylation of HDL particles, which is known to occur in vivo, on PON1 lactonase activity (Ferretti et al., 2010).
PMC8045895	R08001	The authors demonstrated a decrease in lactonase activity with increasing addition of homocystein thiolactone.
PMC8045895	R08002	The concentrations they used were from 10 to 1000 μM, and the last of them led to a two-third decrease in lactonase activity compared with the control HDL, where HcyT was absent.
PMC8045895	R09000	The lipidomic context of PON1 lactonase activity was investigated with DHC as a substrate in two articles (Rosenblat et al., 2006, 2012).
PMC8045895	R10001	They analyzed arylesterase, paraoxonase, and lactonase activities, and as expected, no activity was observed in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), whereas all three activities were observed in the HDL fraction.
PMC8045895	R11000	Of interest, paraoxonase activity was similar in HDL and LPDS, whereas arylesterase and lactonase activities were significantly higher in HDL compared with LPDS.
PMC8045895	R11001	With lactonase, the difference in activity between HDL and LPDS was greatest.
PMC8045895	R11002	Rosenblat et al. (2006) suggested that the environment in HDL stabilizes PON1's structure; displacement from HDL causes conformational changes that reduce lactonase and arylesterase activity, whereas paraoxonase activity is less sensitive to such changes.
PMC8045895	R12003	The authors reported the effect of VLDL with rePON1 as well, which indicates that neighboring proteins and lipids in HDL are not necessary for the mediation of VLDL-induced inhibition.
PMC8045895	R12004	The authors also investigated bezafibrate as a compound, which reverses the effect of VLDL on paraoxonase and arylesterase activity (Rosenblat et al., 2012).
PMC8045895	R13000	All the macroscopic, behavioral, and personal parameters with which researchers have attempted to explain interindividual variation in PON1 lactonase activity, such as age, gender, exercise, diet/nutriomics, medications, and exposure to chemicals, were grouped together as “Environmental/Social effects.”
PMC8045895	R14000	Although the influence of age on PON1 activity in humans is still not entirely clear for adolescents and adults, it has been shown that neonatal PON1 arylesterase activity is much lower than that of toddlers (Cole et al, 2003).
PMC8045895	R14001	For lactonase activity, Gugliucci et al.
PMC8045895	R15000	In several articles, the authors grouped their results on lactonase activity into categories, including age.
PMC8045895	R15001	An example of such a study is the genome-wide association approach by Quillen et al. (2012), where the authors identified that age accounts for 1.4% of interindividual variation in PON1 lactonase activity (Quillen et al., 2012).
PMC8045895	R16000	Among other factors that influence PON1 activity, Quillen et al. (2012) also focused on the effect of gender on lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R16001	Although the authors' model indicates that 0.4% of the interindividual difference in both paraoxonase and arylesterase activities can be explained by gender, we suggest that gender does not appreciably explain interindividual variation in DHC lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R17000	A more recent article also focused on the influence of gender on PON1, with TBL as a substrate, and concludes that gender does influence lactonase activity (Trentini et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	R17001	Trentini et al. detected higher PON1 lactonase activity among women than among men, even after accounting for confounders such as concentrations of HDL and cholesterol, age, smoking, body mass index, and waist circumference.
PMC8045895	R17002	The authors reported a significant difference between genders for both lactonase and arylesterase activities (Trentini et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	R19000	Aviram and Rosenblat (2012) also investigated how the consumption of several different juices impacts PON1 lactonase activity for DHC.
PMC8045895	R19001	They found that in healthy subjects, consumption of currant juice and pomegranate juice both led to an increase in PON1 lactonase activity after 1 week.
PMC8045895	R20000	Kameyama et al. (2016) studied the impact of diet on PON1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R20001	In their study, male volunteers who consumed three different meals and lactonase activity, with TBBL as a substrate, was determined after consumption of these meals.
PMC8045895	R21000	Model organisms have also been used to perform experiments about the impact of diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on PON1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R21001	No significant difference in lactonase activity of rat serum before and after a PUFA-rich meal has been demonstrated.
PMC8045895	R21002	Moreover, authors also found no difference in lactonase activity between the nondiabetic control without oil administration and the diabetic group (Kopál et al., 2014).
PMC8045895	R22000	Although the interactions of PON1 with various mediations have been established and are displayed in databases such as DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2017), only few of these studies investigated lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R22001	For example, of the 12 articles focusing on association of PON1 activity and medications for schizophrenia, which were analyzed in a recent review (Moreira et al., 2018), only Gilca et al. (2014) investigated lactonase activity using DHC as a substrate.
PMC8045895	R23001	compared lactonase activity in patients taking clozapine, patients taking risperidone, and with healthy individuals.
PMC8045895	R23002	The authors demonstrated that taking risperidone resulted in significantly lower lactonase activity than the healthy control group.
PMC8045895	R23003	The authors also showed that the patients taking clozapine in turn had a significantly lower lactonase activity than the patients taking risperidone.
PMC8045895	R24000	Another group of medications, which has been associated with PON1 lactonase activity in one study, are oral contraceptives (Kowalska et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R24001	The authors concluded that taking contraceptives correlated with a significant increase in lactonase and arylesterase activity, but with a significant decrease in paraoxonase activity.
PMC8045895	R25002	The authors concluded that while lactonase activity is not significantly affected by the amount of exposure to pesticides, there is a significant decrease in lactonase activity in greenhouse workers in comparison with the healthy controls with no occupational exposure to pesticides.
PMC8045895	R25003	The authors tested several different organophosphate substrates and reported that higher exposure to pesticides did however lead to a significant decrease in arylesterase activity and, interestingly, to a nonsignificant increase in paraoxonase activity (Lozano-Paniagua et al., 2016).
PMC8045895	R26000	A study followed the effects of an exercise regimen in a group of obese human subjects on the DHC lactonase and paraoxonase activities of their serum PON1 (Russo et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R28000	PON1 lactonase activity has been studied regarding several diseases and other medical conditions.
PMC8045895	R29001	Many articles have been published investigating the association of these with PON1, including six articles that included lactonase activity, four of which have been carried out on humans (Gugliucci et al., 2015; Martinelli et al., 2009; Murillo-González et al., 2020; Ponce-Ruiz et al., 2020) and two on animals (De Keyzer et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010).
PMC8045895	R31002	The authors then normalized TBBL activity by dividing it with 7-O-diethyl phosphoryl,3-cyano,4-methyl,7-hydroxycoumarin (DEPCyMC) activity, which has been indicated as a surrogate marker for determining PON1 concentration (Gaidukov and Tawfik, 2007).
PMC8045895	R32000	The resulting normalized lactonase activity was significantly higher in the group with CAD, especially noticeable in individuals with the PON1 192QQ genotype.
PMC8045895	R32001	When they grouped the CAD patients into those with and without myocardial infarction, however, they found no significant difference for any measure of lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R34000	Another study investigated PON1 activity in apolipoprotein-deficient mice expressing human PON1 by adenovirus-mediated insertion of human paraoxonase 1 (hPON1) into mice cells (Zhang et al., 2010).
PMC8045895	R34001	The authors investigated the size of atherosclerotic lesions, which are a risk factor for CVD, and found that transgenic mice with overexpressed hPON1 had significantly higher DHC lactonase activity in their serum, and reduced atherosclerotic lesion size.
PMC8045895	R36000	PON1 lactonase activity has also been investigated in association with liver illnesses.
PMC8045895	R36002	It was found that PON1 lactonase activity for DHC was significantly lower in alcoholic hepatitis compared with controls, and being significantly lower in viral hepatitis compared with alcoholic hepatitis.
PMC8045895	R37000	In another article, the authors investigated TBBL lactonase activity of PON1 in individuals with liver cirrhosis and patients with mild-to-moderate changes in liver function (Marsillach et al., 2009).
PMC8045895	R38000	Serum lactonase activity for DHC was also investigated in dairy cows (Samir Farid et al., 2013).
PMC8045895	R38002	The authors concluded that paraoxonase, DHC lactonase, and arylesterase activity were all significantly lower in animals with fatty liver compared with the control group.
PMC8045895	R39000	Another factor that has been thoroughly studied in association with PON1 lactonase activity is body weight.
PMC8045895	R39001	Three articles reported on the association between body weight and DHC lactonase activity (Alaminos-Castillo et al., 2019; Bacchetti et al., 2019; Rupérez et al., 2013), Ferré et al. (2013) investigated TBBL and Cervellati et al.
PMC8045895	R39004	Of these five articles, three of them found a significant correlation between PON1 lactonase activity and obesity (Alaminos-Castillo et al., 2019; Bacchetti et al., 2019; Ferré et al., 2013).
PMC8045895	R40000	Alaminos-Castillo et al. (2019) reported that DHC lactonase activity is significantly decreased in obese subjects compared with nonobese controls, and increases after surgery.
PMC8045895	R40001	Bacchetti et al. (2019) grouped cases into two categories, overweight women and obese women, and detected that DHC lactonase activity is significantly decreased in each subsequent category compared with healthy individuals (Bacchetti et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	R40002	Ferré et al. (2013) showed a significant decrease in TBBL lactonase activity in obese children compared with nonobese controls.
PMC8045895	R41000	Rupérez et al (2013) did not find an association between PON1 lactonase activity and obesity.
PMC8045895	R41001	Although the authors did not find an association between childhood obesity and any of PON1's enzymatic activities, they did find a positive correlation of DHC lactonase activity with HDL, as well as with concentration of antioxidants.
PMC8045895	R41004	demonstrated a significant decrease in arylesterase activity in very obese subjects; however, they did not show any difference in paraoxonase activity and TBBL lactonase activity between the groups.
PMC8045895	R42000	Five articles reported on PON1 lactonase activity in the context of diabetes (Craciun et al., 2016, Rosenblat et al., 2006, Passaro et al., 2018, Zhou et al., 2020a, 2020b).
PMC8045895	R43000	In women with gestational diabetes mellitus, no significant difference was found in either TBBL lactonase activity or PON1 concentration between women with diabetes and healthy controls (Zhou et al., 2020a).
PMC8045895	R44001	A significant decrease in δ-valerolactone lactonase activity was noted between controls and patients who had both type 1 diabetes and a high amount of hemoglobin glycation.
PMC8045895	R45000	DHC lactonase activity was also investigated in a study that compared patients with diabetes, patients with hypercholesterolemia, and healthy controls.
PMC8045895	R45001	The conclusion was that lactonase activity was significantly reduced in both groups of patients, where diabetic patients had the lowest activity.
PMC8045895	R45002	The same results were acquired for both paraoxonase activity and arylesterase activity (Rosenblat et al., 2006).
PMC8045895	R46002	The authors concluded that there is no correlation between lactonase activity and presence of diabetes, whereas diabetic patients on average had significantly lower arylesterase activity than healthy controls (Passaro et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R47001	compared PON1 lactonase activity for TBBL in neonates with diabetic mothers and in neonates with mothers without diabetes (Zhou et al., 2020b).
PMC8045895	R47002	They found a significant increase in both lactonase activity and DEPCyMC-normalized lactonase activity in children of diabetic patients compared with healthy controls.
PMC8045895	R48000	PON1 lactonase activity for DHC was also compared for Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy controls.
PMC8045895	R48001	The researchers measured lactonase activity and calculated the quotients lactonase activity/HDL concentration and lactonase activity/LDL concentration.
PMC8045895	R49000	Several other medical conditions were studied in association with PON1 lactonase activity: among them are intestinal cancer, psoriasis, celiac disease, hereditary hemochromatosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD), renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPB), bronchial asthma, and acute pancreatitis.
PMC8045895	R50000	Bains et al. (2019) compared PON1 lactonase activity in patients with intestinal cancer before and after treatment.
PMC8045895	R50001	The authors concluded that both arylesterase and DHC lactonase activity significantly decreased after the surgery (compared with before treatment), and then increased again with time (Bains et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	R51000	In psoriatic children, DHC lactonase activity of PON1, as well as arylesterase and paraoxonase activities were found to all be significantly reduced compared with healthy controls (Bacchetti et al., 2020).
PMC8045895	R51001	The authors also measured the concentration of myeloperoxidase (MPO), another enzyme in HDL, which can interact with PON1 and influence its activity.
PMC8045895	R52000	A significant decrease in PON1 DHC lactonase activity was shown in celiac disease (Ferretti et al., 2012).
PMC8045895	R52001	Lactonase activity was lower in diet-treated patients compared with healthy controls, and even lower in patients at diagnosis, when they had not yet begun their diet.
PMC8045895	R52002	Similar results were obtained for PON1 arylesterase and paraoxonase activities.
PMC8045895	R53000	In hereditary hemochromatosis, PON1 paraoxonase activity was significantly decreased in patients with the condition compared with healthy controls, but DHC lactonase and arylesterase activities were not decreased significantly (Martinelli et al., 2013).
PMC8045895	R54000	In CKD, a significant decrease in PON1 benzopiran-2-one lactonase activity was reported in cases compared with healthy controls (Mohammed et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	R54001	After adjusting for concentration, the authors showed that lactonase activity was significantly higher in patients compared with non-CKD controls.
PMC8045895	R54002	The authors also compared the groups of CKD patients with high and low lactonase activity in terms of survival rate and reported that patients with higher lactonase activity also had a higher survival rate.
PMC8045895	R55000	For end-stage renal patients, a study compared DHC lactonase before and after dialysis and found that activity increases significantly after dialysis, as do arylesterase and paraoxonase activities (Gugliucci et al., 2011).
PMC8045895	R57000	In the case of bronchial asthma, both arylesterase and DHC lactonase PON1 activities were shown to be lower in asthmatics compared with healthy controls (Chen et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R57001	The authors verified this by addition of PON1 to the serum sample, which resulted in a very significant rise in lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R59000	Different approaches for measuring PON1 lactonase activity do not produce the same results.
PMC8125016	D06000	A gene expression study of 28 responders and non-responders to AML-stabilizing treatment ATRA/VP identified subsets of differentially expressed genes involved in transcriptional regulation (i.e., DNA/RNA binding proteins, transcription factors and nucleases), protein degradation/activation/modulation and metabolism [30] (data available at the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository with accession code GSE106096).
PMC8125016	D10004	Our observations suggest that the DNA methylation status is not decisive for the effect of our present strategy of epigenetic targeting in the treatment of human AML and DNA methylation profiling cannot be used to predict the response to ATRA/VP therapy.
PMC8125016	I02000	Protein acetylation is regulated by the balance between histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs)
PMC8125016	R05005	The systemic lupus erythematosus Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, which represents proteins involved in the production of IgG autoantibodies that are specific for self-antigens such as DNA or nuclear proteins, was also enriched in the PRE-R patient group.
PMC8125016	R05006	Identified proteins belonging to this pathway are ELANE, cathepsin G (CTSG), H2BC21, H2A.Z variant histone 2 (H2AZ2) and H2B clustered histone 14 (H2BC14).
PMC8125016	R06000	In contrast, levels of proteins involved in processes such as hematopoietic or lymphoid organ development (e.g., sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase 1, SGPL1; SBDS ribosome maturation factor, SBDS), transcription by RNA polymerase II and cell death were higher in PRE-NR patients (Figure 2b, bottom plot; Table 2).
PMC8125016	R11002	A sequence logo of the amino acid sequence windows surrounding the phosphorylation sites of the splicing factor network (Figure S1) identified the SP and the SXR/K motifs for mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and protein kinase C delta/protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha PRKCD/PRKACA, respectively, although RNA polymerase II subunit A (POLR2A) S1920 and SRSF11 S207 are phosphorylated by cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)1 and CDK2, respectively [46].
PMC8125016	R11003	The phosphorylation of RPS6 at S236 by several members of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase family (i.e., RPS6KA1, RPS6KA3 or RPS6KB1) facilitates the assembly of the translation preinitiation complex [57] whereas polo like kinase 1 (PLK1) phosphorylation at RIOK2 S380 regulates mitotic progression [58].
PMC8125016	R11004	Four phosphoproteins belonging to the apoptotic execution phase Reactome pathway II showed higher phosphorylation in PRE-R than in PRE-NR patients.
PMC8125016	R11005	The residue S18 is part of one of the five (S/T)P(K/A)K motifs found in the H1.5 linker histone, cluster member (H1-5) sequence which becomes phosphorylated, possibly by CDKs, during chromatin decondensation [59].
PMC8125016	R11006	Clusters consisted of components of the histone deacetylation complex (i.e., nuclear receptor corepressor 1 and 2, NCOR1/2), and of RNA synthesis/elongation were observed in diseases of signal transduction and TP53 regulates transcription of DNA repair genes enriched Reactome pathways III and IV, respectively.
PMC8125016	R13000	The F-actin depolymerizing activity of CFL1 is inactivated by phosphorylation on S3 by NIK related kinase (NRK)/NIK-like embryo-specific kinase (NESK), testis associated actin remodeling kinase 1 (TESK1), protein kinase D1 (PRKD1) and LIM domain kinase 1/2 (LIMK1/LIMK2)
PMC8125016	R13002	Interestingly, some of these kinases were predicted to be activated in the PRE-R group by kinase–substrate enrichment analysis (KSEA) (Figure 3e, see results below).
PMC8125016	R16000	In order to determine whether the protein phosphorylation levels were due to changes in protein abundance or to kinase activation, we investigated the expression of 85 phosphoproteins to the 107 differentially regulated phosphosites.
PMC8125016	R17000	To identify protein kinases differentially activated in the PRE-R and PRE-NR groups, we performed phosphorylation site motif analysis (IceLogo)
PMC8125016	R17002	We found basophilic RXXpS/pT and RPPS motifs characteristics of PRKCA/PRKCD and dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2), respectively, in PRE-R patient samples when compared to the PRE-NR group (Figure 3d).
PMC8125016	R17003	Furthermore, the KSEA [44,45], which is based on phosphorylation FCs to estimate kinase’s activity, confirmed the higher activity of these kinases together with LIMK1/2 and CDK2 in the PRE-R group (Figure 3e).
PMC8125016	R18001	Only two kinases, protein kinase cGMP-dependent 2 (PRKG2) and microtubule affinity regulating kinase 1 (MARK1) involved in the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases in osteoblasts and cell polarity, respectively [64,65], were predicted to be more active in the PRE-NR group.
PMC8125016	R18002	The prediction of phosphorylation sites by a novel deep learning architecture based on multi-layer convolution neural networks (i.e., DeepPhos) installed in the piNET web platform [48,49] confirmed the higher number of activated kinases on substrates more phosphorylated in PRE-R patients when compared with the PRE-NR group (Figure S3) as previously observed in the KSEA analysis.
PMC8125016	R18003	Among them, CDK1/2, MAPK4 (displayed as ERK1 in the figure) and PRKCD were again predicted to be more activated in the PRE-R group.
PMC8125016	R19000	The search of our phosphosite dataset by the kinase activation loop tool (see Materials and Methods) did not find any phosphorylated residue in the domain activation loops.
PMC8125016	R19001	However, we identified two kinases (in addition to the RIOK2 identified previously), CDK13 and pre-mRNA processing factor 4B (PRPF4B) more phosphorylated at S395 and S397 in PRE-NR and at S578 and S580 in PRE-R patients, respectively.
PMC8125016	R29001	Clusters corresponding to ten different response patterns were identified in the responder group; two of them with low site-specific phosphorylation at 8D (cluster 1–4) were enriched with RNA processing, mRNA splicing, via spliceosome (e.g., SRRM1/2; RNA binding motif protein 15, RBM15; serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2, SRSF2) and nuclear speck (e.g., SRSF1; RB binding protein 6, ubiquitin ligase, RBBP6) GO terms whereas clusters with high site-specific phosphorylation at 8D (cluster 5–7) were enriched with Rho GTPase binding, cytoplasmic mRNA processing body assembly and actin filament binding (Figure 6a, right plot).
PMC8125016	R29002	Clusters with high and low site-specific phosphorylation at 3D were enriched with the negative regulation of vasculature development/RNA polymerase I core binding (e.g., PML nuclear body scaffold, PML; programmed cell death 4, PDCD4; nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1, NOLC1) and cyclin/CDK positive transcription elongation (i.e., RB transcriptional corepressor 1, RB1; CDK12) GO terms, respectively.
PMC8125016	R31000	To identify protein kinases differentially activated in the temporal pair-wise comparisons we performed phosphorylation site motif analysis with WebLogo [43].
PMC8125016	R32000	To briefly summarize the important observations from this part of our study, we observed again that the triple combination altered the phosphorylation of proteins, especially those involved in the regulation of translation/transcription/RNA metabolism, but additional effects were also observed for cytoskeletal/actin proteins and Rho GTPase binding.
PMC8125016	R33001	Clusters with an increasing temporal phosphorylation profiling (clusters 1 and 8), i.e., from PRE to 8D, in the non-responder phosphoproteome were enriched with CDK activity (e.g., CDK1, CDK2, CDK11B, CDK12) and RNA splicing (e.g., DEAH-box helicase 16, DHX16) whereas clusters with a decreasing temporal phosphorylation profiling (clusters 2 and 5) were enriched with G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway (e.g., IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 2, IGGAP2; Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 7, ARHGEF7) and RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity (e.g., high mobility group protein HMG-I/HMG-Y and HMGA1) GO terms (Figure 7a, right plot).
PMC8125016	R34000	Clusters with the highest protein phosphorylation at 3D (cluster 3, 4 and 6) were enriched with RNA splicing, protein–DNA complex assembly (e.g., H1.4 linker histone, cluster member, H1-4; heterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3, HP1BP3; remodeling and spacing factor 1, Rsf-1, RSF1) and the sites of the DNA damage (e.g., replication timing regulatory factor 1, RIF1) GO terms, whereas clusters with the lowest protein phosphorylation at 3D (clusters 7, 9 and 10) were enriched with a negative regulation of the cellular catabolic process (e.g., PML, dyskerin pseudouridine synthase 1, DKC1), nuclear chromosome, telomeric region and the negative regulation of T cell activation (e.g., CD74 molecule, CD74; sialophorin, SPN) when compared to pre-treatment and 8D conditions.
PMC8125016	R36000	The analysis of kinase substrates using the WebLogo tool found an enrichment of basophilic R/KXpS/pT and the SP motif characteristics of PRKCA/PRKCD and MAPK3/1, respectively, in the 3D-NR and 8D-NR patient samples when compared to the pre-treatment group (Figure 7c, left and middle plot).
PMC8125016	R36001	The acidic SXD/ED/E kinase motif of CSNK2A1 was clearly observed in the 8D-NR when compared to the 3D-NR group (Figure 7c, right plot).
PMC8125016	R37000	Taken together, the non-responder group differed from the responders both with regard to the phosphorylation events on the actin/cytoskeleton but also with regard to transcriptional regulation and GTPase/G-protein coupled signaling.
