PMC1134064	A00002	Extracellular-exposed caveolae-specific proteins CD36 and copper-containing amine oxidase were concealed inside the vesicles and resisted trypsin treatment.
PMC1134064	D00003	The copper-containing amine oxidase and CD36 are shown to be the major extracellular-orientated proteins, whereas caveolin-1 is the main cytosol-orientated protein in these caveolae.

PMC1134064	D01006	EHD2 (Table ​(Table3),3), also found in caveolae for the first time, belongs to a family of conserved EHD-containing proteins [43], which function in endocytosis and in signal-transduction pathways downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases [44].
PMC1134064	D03000	The mouse PTRF has been shown to be involved in termination of transcription by RNA polymerase I [36], hence in enhancement of this transcription [47] and in control of transcription by polymerase II [48].

PMC1134064	I00009	The N-terminal domain of caveolin can interact with and concentrate, at the caveolae surface, a number of signal transduction proteins, such as G-proteins, Src-like kinases, protein kinase C and H-Ras [1].
PMC1134064	M00002	Adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion of subcutaneous human fat tissue and homogenized as described in [7].
PMC1134064	R02005	This protein is also referred to as semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase [27] or vascular adhesion protein VAP-1 in endothelial cells [28].
PMC1134064	R02008	In addition to caveolin, CD36 and copper-containing amine oxidase were also determined as the major protein constituents of immunopurified caveolae from rat adipocytes [14].
PMC1134064	R06001	However, six of the proteins, namely annexin V, R-Ras, Ras suppressor protein 1, SRBC (serum deprivation response-related gene product that binds to C-kinase; a protein kinase Cδ-binding protein), EHD2 (EHD-containing protein 2, where EHD stands for Eps15-homology domain) and PTRF, have not been specifically localized to caveolae previous to our work.

PMC1794502	A00006	These latter spots corresponded to 11 proteins or protein fragments, including serum albumin fragments (13 spots), 5 previously recognized proteins (7 spots), and 4 proteins (3 spots) that had not been previously described in human BALF maps, namely calumenin, cytohesin-2, cystatin SN, and mitochondrial DNA topoisomerase 1 (mtDNA TOP1).
PMC1794502	A00009	Whereas levels of glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP), Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) and cystatin SN were downregulated in SScFib+ patients compared with SScFib- patients, we observed a significant upregulation of α1-acid glycoprotein, haptoglobin-α chain, calgranulin (Cal) B, cytohesin-2, calumenin, and mtDNA TOP1 in SScFib+ patients.
PMC1794502	A00010	Some of these proteins (GSTP, Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase, and cystatin SN) seem to be involved in mechanisms that protect lungs against injury or inflammation, whereas others (Cal B, cytohesin-2, and calumenin) seem to be involved in mechanisms that drive lung fibrogenesis.
PMC1794502	D01003	In SScFib+ patients, GSTP and cystatin SN were below the detection limit, whereas Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase was downregulated.
PMC1794502	D03001	Among various enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms that protect cells and tissues from oxidants [26,27], glutathione transferases [28] and SODs [29] are among such mechanisms that are thought to have a key protective role, especially in the lung.
PMC1794502	D03004	The observation that GSTP and Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase levels are severely downregulated in BALF from SScFib+ patients is in line with these findings, and confirms the relevance of these molecules as a defense tool for the lung against oxidant-induced damage and/or fibroproliferation.
PMC1794502	D04001	Cystatin SN is a secreted protein, which belongs to SD-type or type-2 cystatins [31], which are potent inhibitors of CA clan mammalian cysteine peptidases.
PMC1794502	D04003	The direct inhibition of endogenous and exogenous cysteine peptidases is the only function described so far for cystatin SN, suggesting that its function is to protect tissues against injury induced by these enzymes.
PMC1794502	D08001	Although its biological function is mostly unknown, a recent study demonstrated that cytohesin-2 is an activator of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway [44].
PMC1794502	D08002	Because MAP kinases are activator signals for lung fibroblasts [23], we suggest that cytohesin-2 might participate in the development and/or progression of lung fibrosis in SSc patients through the activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathways in lung fibroblasts.

PMC1794502	R02002	These 24 differently expressed spots corresponded to 11 proteins/protein fragments in total: 13 spots corresponded to serum albumin fragments, 7 of them corresponded to 5 previously recognized BALF proteins (α1-acid glycoprotein (2 spots), haptoglobin-α chain (2 spots), calgranulin (Cal) B, Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP)), and 3 spots corresponded to 4 proteins that, to our knowledge, had not previously been described in published BALF two-dimensional maps (calumenin and cytohesin-2 (1 spot), cystatin SN and a fragment of mtDNA TOP1).
PMC1794502	R02007	Finally, whereas Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase was significantly downregulated, GSTP and cystatin SN were not detectable in SScFib+ patients in contrast with SScFib- patients.
PMC1797627	M02000	Serum samples were sequentially passed through protein A and Cibacron blue columns to remove IgG and albumin, respectively.
PMC1850944	D03010	These results suggest that the binding of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to the IgY-12 system may be concentration dependent; however, the exact mechanism remains unclear.
PMC1850944	M01002	To generate a spiked plasma sample, bovine carbonic anhydrase II, rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and bovine β-lactoglobulin (Sigma, St Louis, MO) were added to unprocessed human plasma samples to final concentrations of 40 μg/mL, and equine skeletal muscle myoglobin and chicken ovalbumin (Sigma) were added to final concentrations of 4 μg/mL. Unless otherwise noted, all protein sample processing was performed at 4 °C.
PMC1850944	R03000	The detection of the 5 non-human protein standards (i.e., 40 μg/mL each of bovine carbonic anhydrase II, rabbit G3PDH, and bovine β-lactoglobulin, and 4 μg/mL each of equine myoglobin and chicken ovalbumin) from the replicate LC-MS/MS analyses is summarized in Table 1.
PMC1850944	R03003	While non-specific binding of rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was observed (i.e., the protein was identified in both bound and flow-through fractions), the extent of non-specific binding for this protein was reproducible, which is key for quantitative studies.
PMC1850944	R06006	A number of proteins bound significantly to the IgY-12 column, such as zinc-α2-glycoprotein, apolipoproteins (C I, CIII, D, E, and L1), CD 5 antigen-like protein, serum amyloid proteins A2 and A4, transthyretin, hemoglobin, serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1, and leucine-rich α-2-glycoprotein (Table 3).

PMC2408776	M01003	After quenching the endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H2O2, the cells were incubated with 0.5% blocking reagent for 30 min (TSA-Direct kit, Dupont-NEN, Boston, MA) and then immunolabeled with one of the following antibodies at room temperature for 1 h: mouse monoclonal anti-fibronectin (1:200), rabbit polyclonal anti-laminin (1:200), mouse monoclonal anti-vimentin (1:200), mouse monoclonal anti-neuron specific enolase (1:200), and mouse monoclonal anti-Factor VIII (1:200).
PMC2408776	M01004	After incubation with the primary antibody, the cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated for an additional 45 min with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:300; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:300, Vector Laboratories) where appropriate followed by avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex for 10 min.
PMC2408776	M01005	After a series of washes, the specimens were treated with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB)/peroxidase reaction (Vector DAB substrate kit; Vector Laboratories), washed in water, treated with hematoxylin counterstain, washed again, and then dried at room temperature.

PMC2408776	R00001	We confirmed that the primary cultures obtained from both normal and POAG individuals were indeed TM cells since they were immunopositive for TM specific molecular markers, extracellular matrix molecules (fibronectin and laminin), the cytoskeletal molecule, vimentin, and neuronal specific enolase.
PMC2408776	R01005	Spot 3 was ribosomal protein S6 kinase (MW 61.7 kDa, pI 6.42).
PMC2413104	R00003	Overall, transferrin (TRF) and transthyretin (TTR) were down-regulated and 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX), serum amyloid A1 protein precursor (SAA), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and lysine-specific histone demethylase1 (LSD1) were up-regulated in two NPC groups compared with the healthy group.
PMC2413104	R00004	Furthermore, increased expression levels of 12-lipoxygenase, sICAM-1 and SAA were observed in LNM NPC as compared with non-LNM NPC.
PMC2413104	R00005	However, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and cytochrome P450 (cytochrome P450) were expressed significantly and constantly only in LNM NPC patients.
PMC2493375	A00000	Broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitors (MMPI) were unsuccessful in cancer clinical trials, partly due to side effects resulting from limited knowledge of the full repertoire of matrix metalloproteinase substrates, termed the substrate degradome, and hence the in vivo functions of MMPs.
PMC2493375	A00007	Considered together, this is a strong predictor of biologically relevant substrates cleaved in the cellular context that led to the identification of many undescribed MMP-14 substrates, 20 of which we validated biochemically, including DJ-1, galectin-1, Hsp90α, pentraxin 3, progranulin, Cyr61, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A, and dickkopf-1.
PMC2493375	A00009	Hence, this approach describes the dynamic pattern of cell membrane ectodomain shedding and its perturbation upon metalloproteinase drug treatment.
PMC2493375	D00004	By using MMP-14 transfection, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation, and MMPI blockade, we showed the dynamic nature of proteolytic shedding and that the accumulation of cleaved ectodomains and protein fragments was metalloproteinase dependent, executed by the cell surface membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase, MMP-14.
PMC2493375	D01000	In nonbiased quantitative proteomic approaches, criteria must be set to identify which of the myriad proteins whose levels are modulated by a protease are substrates and which are indirect effects wrought by an altered cellular signaling environment due to proteolytic processing of individual components of signaling pathways or ripples in the protease web.
PMC2493375	D01006	This and the decreased MMPI/vehicle ICAT ratios are good indicators that IGFBP-7 and IGFBP-4 are also matrix metalloproteinase substrates.
PMC2493375	D02000	Here, candidate substrates were identified from a cellular environment, which supports the concept that they are indeed natural matrix metalloproteinase substrates.
PMC2493375	D02006	This likely reflects the different partitioning of these two proteases with respect to the substrate, to the cell membrane (MMP-14) and the secretome (MMP-2), emphasizing the need for cell-based analyses of proteolysis to determine biological relevance.
PMC2493375	D03001	These effects include release of a protein interactor of the processed protein or proteoglycan; the effects on a cascade in the protease web, for example, activation of a second protease by MMP-14, such as MMP-13 (59) or MMP-2 (112, 125), which then cleaves the substrate; altered signaling and hence transcriptional events; or inhibition of other metalloproteases, such as members of the ADAM/ADAM-TS families due to the broad specificity profile of some MMP-directed hydroxamate inhibitors.
PMC2493375	D03003	Elafin binds to extracellular matrix proteins via transglutaminase cross-linking mediated by its N-terminal domain (114).
PMC2493375	D03004	Thus, shedding of this inhibitor bound to the actual matrix metalloproteinase substrate is likely as elafin is also resistant to MMP-8 (48).
PMC2493375	D03005	This has been described for the chemokine KC, which binds to syndecan-1 (67), and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (cyclophilin B), which binds heparan sulfate proteoglycans (2, 27) and which was also decreased in the conditioned medium from the MMPI-treated cells (MMPI/vehicle ICAT ratio, 0.64
PMC2493375	D04001	This is exemplified by the variety of known matrix metalloproteinase substrates identified, which included chemokines (GROα, IL-8), growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs, CTGF, TGF-beta binding protein-1S), cell surface receptors (uPAR, gC1qR, integrins), enzymes (MMP-1, uPA), and proteinase inhibitors (tissue factor pathway inhibitor, cystatin C), as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (e.g., collagen [VI], laminin, fibrillin).
PMC2493375	D04003	Similarly, other proteins and novel substrates that were modulated by the MMPI are diverse, encompassing ECM proteins (epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like ECM protein 1, TSP-1, ECM-1), innate immunity and inflammatory mediators (pentraxin 3, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A), receptors (Axl receptor tyrosine kinase, CRIM-1), proteases (cathepsins A and B, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, serine protease 23, legumain), and protease inhibitors (elafin, Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor 2).
PMC2493375	D05005	The potential role of matrix metalloproteinase processing in these functions is currently under study.
PMC2493375	D06000	Proteases are not only responsible for protein degradation but, by limited and specific cleavages, can act as switches, turning protein activity on or off, or they can modulate protein function in more complex ways.
PMC2493375	D06002	For example, matrix metalloproteinase cleavage of just four amino terminal residues of chemokines that are expressed in inflammation converts agonists to antagonists (77), activates other chemokines (131), converts CXCL12 to a neurotoxin that switches receptor specificity (145), and sheds cell membrane-bound fractalkine (26).
PMC2493375	D07003	DJ-1 contains a putative active site similar to that of cysteine proteases, though the catalytic triad is orientated unfavorably, with C-terminal helix 9 blocking the putative catalytic site (53), and only a weak activity against a fluorogenic casein substrate has been reported (86).
PMC2493375	D08001	The neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities of neuron-specific enolase lie in the C-terminal 30 residues (44), and these functions could be modified by the matrix metalloproteinase processing reported here.
PMC2493375	D08003	This molecule contains within its sequence granulins 1 to 7, 6-kDa peptides released by elastase proteolysis, which have independent functions, for example promoting proliferation and inflammation (45).
PMC2493375	D09000	Targeting a protease might have unexpected positive or negative influences on a disease course, depending upon whether the enzyme is a drug target or an antitarget (92).
PMC2493375	D09006	Inhibiting shedding of other molecules may be beneficial; e.g., beta-2-microglobulin is a component of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) complex, which may be shed by tumor cells (though probably not by direct processing, since it was not a matrix metalloproteinase substrate in vitro) to prevent recognition of tumor antigens by CD8+ T cells, thus escaping immune detection (1, 105).
PMC2493375	D10000	It is clear that the substrate degradome of MMPs and other proteases must be defined during the validation of proteases as drug targets, to aid in the decision to treat disease using antiprotease drugs.
PMC2493375	D10001	Certainly, this could help to predict and minimize the side effects caused by long-term antiprotease drug administration to patients and so also aid in medicinal chemistry modification of drug leads during drug development.
PMC2493375	D10003	This requires a concerted effort at matrix metalloproteinase substrate discovery using degradomic studies which will be invaluable for the development of specific and effective anticancer drugs.

PMC2493375	I00000	The membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-14) is a member of the MMP family of zinc-dependent endoproteinases that are important in cancer (31, 92), consisting of 23 members in humans, 6 of which (including MMP-14) are membrane anchored (50, 122).
PMC2493375	I00001	The MMPs are one of four families of the metzincin clan, which includes ADAM (a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease domain) and ADAM with thrombospondin type 1 motifs (ADAM-TS) extracellular proteases (40).
PMC2493375	I00005	However, these proteases are now known to process a plethora of bioactive molecules (chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and their binding proteins, receptors, protease inhibitors, and cell adhesion molecules) (17, 75, 94), regulating processes involved in development (95) and normal cellular and extracellular homeostasis (88), as well as pathological processes such as inflammation and cancer (31, 41, 76, 91, 97, 122).
PMC2493375	I00009	Hence, high-throughput nonbiased techniques to uncover novel substrates that might reveal new functional roles for matrix metalloproteinase processing in physiological and pathological processes are required (90).
PMC2493375	I01000	Despite the fact that a large number of phase III clinical trials of small-molecule and peptidic matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPI) were reached, these inhibitors were unsuccessful in treating cancer and arthritis, with some patients experiencing adverse side effects including tendonitis and myalgia (11, 22, 92, 93, 149).
PMC2493375	I01006	For example, in rodents, there are more than 80 additional protease genes (102), a major class of enzyme drug targets (69, 92), many of which are expressed in host defense cells.
PMC2493375	I02003	ICAT is used for quantitative comparison of the proteins in two samples labeled with a heavy or light label, for example, protease versus null or inactive protease (25, 129) or drug- versus vehicle-treated cells.
PMC2493375	I03001	To investigate proteolysis in a cellular environment, protease inhibitors or RNA interference experiments can also be utilized to reduce the activity of a particular protease and thereby identify substrates which accumulate while providing information useful for drug development (14).
PMC2493375	I03005	This proteomics approach describes a complex dynamic environment of basal proteolytic shedding from the plasma membrane and pericellular matrix by using metalloproteinase activity.
PMC2493375	R00000	To gain further insight into the substrate degradome of MMP-14, we utilized the MMPI prinomastat to block metalloproteinase protein processing and ectodomain shedding in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells transfected with MMP-14.
PMC2493375	R01000	A largely unresolved concern of the unsuccessful MMPI clinical trials has been whether the matrix metalloproteinase drug targets were effectively dosed, i.e., were inhibitor concentrations systemically attained and available for a sufficient time (22)?
PMC2493375	R02005	S1D in the supplemental material) in this system with prinomastat treatment, whereas treatment with 1,10-phenanthroline, a zinc chelator and nonspecific inhibitor of metalloproteinases, was toxic at concentrations of ≥0.1
PMC2493375	R02007	Thus, the changes in ICAT ratios between MMPI and vehicle were due to metalloproteinase inhibitory effects and not due to drug-induced alterations in cell proliferation, apoptosis, or toxicity to the MDA-MB-231 cells.
PMC2493375	R04001	We hypothesized that levels of matrix metalloproteinase substrates and binding partners would change in MDA-MB-231 cell transfectants in the presence of the MMPI due to reduced processing, shedding, and clearance (Fig.
PMC2493375	R06001	Twenty-nine known matrix metalloproteinase substrates were identified.
PMC2493375	R07001	For the other 18, cleavage by MMP-14 has not been reported, but based on the redundancy of processing by the matrix metalloproteinase family, it is likely that many of these are MMP-14 substrates.
PMC2493375	R07005	Follistatin-related protein 1, cystatin C, and GROα, however, were not processed by MMP-14 in vitro (data not shown), suggesting that these ICAT ratios were lowered due to indirect effects of the MMPI, inhibition of other active metalloproteases expressed by these cells, or binding to MMP-14 exosites or suggesting that essential proteins or interactions present in the cellular context are not reproduced in the biochemical assays.
PMC2493375	R08001	Prinomastat potently inhibits MMP-14, as well as the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 and MMP-3 and MMP-13 (Ki values, 30 to 300 pM), but weakly inhibits MMP-1 and MMP-7 (see Fig.
PMC2493375	R08003	Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (83) and microarray analysis (C. J. Morrison and C. M. Overall, unpublished data), we found that MDA-MB-231 cells expressed several MMPs at the RNA level, although no soluble matrix metalloproteinase activity was detected previously by using a peptide substrate-based assay (129).
PMC2493375	R08012	However, the possibility that MMPs or metalloproteinases, such as ADAM-10, that are inhibited by prinomastat could contribute to substrate cleavage in vivo cannot be discounted.
PMC2493375	R09003	Significantly, many of these proteins, including seven that are known matrix metalloproteinase substrates, had reduced ICAT ratios when the MMP-14-transfected cells were incubated with the MMPI compared with those of the vehicle (Table ​(Table3;3; also see Table S6A in the supplemental material, MMPI/vehicle).
PMC2493375	R11000	We chose several proteins for in vitro validation by cleavage assays to determine whether the shedding was direct, that is, due to MMP-14 cleavage of the proteins themselves or due to indirect effects or other proteases.
PMC2493375	R11013	Iduronate-2-sulfatase was also processed, at higher efficiency, by MMP-2 and MMP-8 (see Fig.
PMC2493375	R12002	Although the MMPI/vehicle ICAT ratios of the protease inhibitors elafin, Kunitz-type protease inhibitor 1, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) were decreased, the elafin and Kunitz-type protease inhibitor 1 proteins were not significantly cleaved by MMPs in vitro (data not shown), and TIMP-1 is a specific matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, though it does not inhibit MMP-14 (141).
PMC2493375	R13002	These included single-pass type I and type II membrane proteins (e.g., Axl receptor tyrosine kinase and catechol-O-methyltransferase), multipass membrane proteins (e.g., chloride intracellular channel protein 1, SERCA2), and glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (e.g., CD59 and uPAR) for which a direct shedding activity can be visualized.
PMC2493375	R14001	The amount of the 68.2-kDa (apparent molecular mass) ectodomain of Axl receptor tyrosine kinase, a receptor for Gas6 which stimulates cell proliferation (78), in the conditioned medium was reduced in the presence of the MMPI, consistent with the ICAT MMPI/vehicle ratio of 0.24 (Fig. ​(Fig.4A).4A).
PMC2493375	R14004	Shedding of these two membrane proteins was enhanced by the treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which is known to upregulate cell surface expression of various proteases, including MMP-14 (71) (Fig. 4C and D), consistent with the MMP-14-transfected cell results.
PMC2493375	R15011	Although matrix metalloproteinase exosite interactions with sites present in the uPAR protein or interactions with other binding proteins might be required for cleavage, the peptide cleavage data suggest that neither MMP-14 nor MMP-1, -2, -8, or -9 directly shed suPAR.
PMC2493375	R16001	In particular, the blockade of metalloproteinase cleavage, shown by the reversal of the ICAT ratios obtained for MMP-14/vector (no MMPI) compared with those of MMPI/vehicle (Table ​(Table3),3), demonstrates that the combined analysis of cells, ICAT labeling, and MS-MS in the absence of inhibitor and then following inhibitor treatment can be used reliably to identify proteolysis-related changes in the proteome.
PMC2493375	R16003	Therefore, a number of proteins which exhibited MMPI/vehicle ratios of ≤0.77 in the conditioned medium, i.e., within the range observed for known matrix metalloproteinase substrates, were also selected for validation that might be novel substrates of MMP-14 (Table ​(Table55 shows selected proteins; Table S8 in the supplemental material for a complete list of individual peptides and ICAT ratios for these proteins).
PMC2493375	R17007	Since glutathione S-transferase is 26.4 kDa, MMP-14 cleavage occurred at more than two sites within DJ-1.
PMC2493375	R18003	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (PPI-A, also termed cyclophilin A) is an intracellular molecular chaperone that, when secreted, functions as a proinflammatory cytokine, signaling via CD147 (EMMPRIN) and activating endothelial cells (55, 144).
PMC2493375	R18007	Gamma enolase (neuron-specific enolase), the γγ form of the glycolytic enzyme enolase (57), was proteolyzed by MMP-14, but cleavage products (ranging from apparent molecular masses of 49.0 to 33.9 kDa) were faint and disappeared at higher MMP-14 concentrations, suggestive of complete degradation (Fig. ​(Fig.6E).6E).
PMC2493375	R18010	The connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), cysteine rich protein (Cyr61), and nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV) gene (CCN) family (99) includes CTGF, a known matrix metalloproteinase substrate (25, 43).
PMC2493375	R18014	Progranulin is a multifunctional glycoprotein involved in development, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and repair that contains granulins 1 to 7, which are released by proteolysis by elastase (45).
PMC2518410	A00000	Matriptase, a type 2 transmembrane serine protease, is predominately expressed by epithelial and carcinoma cells in which hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor 1 (HAI-1), a membrane-bound, Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, is also expressed.
PMC2518410	A00002	As a consequence, activation of matriptase is immediately followed by HAI-1-mediated inhibition, with the activated matriptase being sequestered into HAI-1 complexes.
PMC2518410	A00003	Matriptase is also expressed by peripheral blood leukocytes, such as monocytes and macrophages; however, in contrast to epithelial cells, monocytes and macrophages were reported not to express HAI-1, suggesting that these leukocytes possess alternate, HAI-1-independent mechanisms regulating the zymogen activation and protease inhibition of matriptase.
PMC2518410	A00007	Identification of matriptase-serpin inhibitor complexes provides evidence for the first time that the proteolytic activity of matriptase, from those cells that express no or low levels of HAI-1, may be controlled by secreted serpins.
PMC2518410	D00001	As a membrane-bound serine protease with a single-pass transmembrane domain, the bulk of the matriptase molecule, including its serine protease domain, has been believed to orient itself toward the extracellular side and to function as a protease activator on the cell surface to activate substrates extracellularly (17).
PMC2518410	D00002	However, the dual roles of HAI-1 as a conventional protease inhibitor for matriptase (1) and as a factor required for zymogen activation of the protease (27) would seem to dictate that free, active matriptase is only likely to exist for a very short time.
PMC2518410	D00004	Although it has been challenging to determine the exact cellular locations where the activation of matriptase occurs, it seems likely that it takes place either at the plasma membrane or in the secretory pathway during its trafficking toward the plasma membrane because activated matriptase was previously detected at cell-cell junctions (2, 8) and in vesicle-like structures within cells (16).
PMC2518410	D00006	Therefore, in matriptase-expressing cells that also express a comparable amount of HAI-1, free, active matriptase may never reach the extracellular environment at meaningful levels.
PMC2518410	D00010	Therefore, free, active matriptase has to reach the extracellular environment, at least on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane, for exposure to these secreted serpin-type serine protease inhibitors.
PMC2518410	D01000	Mammary epithelial cells produce most milk proteins, and, since milk-derived, immortal mammary epithelial cells express both matriptase and HAI-1, the milk-derived matriptase-HAI-1 complexes are very likely produced by mammary epithelial cells (17).
PMC2518410	D01003	Since the activated matriptase produced by mammary epithelial cells is sequestered in HAI-1 complexes and in light of the stability of HAI-1/matriptase complexes, it seems very unlikely that the activated matriptase in serpin complexes is derived from matriptase liberated from HAI-1 complexes, being inhibited by and forming complexes with these three serpins.
PMC2518410	D01004	This possibility is made more unlikely by the facts that 1) the pH of milk does not favor the dissociation of matriptase-HAI-1 complexes, 2) no free HAI-1 was detected in milk as would be expected if the serpin-bound matriptase was derived from HAI-1 complexes (Figs. 1 and 8), and 3) free α2AP was undetectable in milk and is however found in complexes with matriptase (Fig. 5).
PMC2518410	D01006	Had matriptase been dissociated from HAI-1 complexes in milk, one would expect α1AT to have a quantitative advantage in forming complexes with matriptase compared with ATIII due to the large amount of free α1AT.
PMC2518410	D01007	These observations suggest that there are complicated biological processes behind the formation of these matriptase-serpin complexes regarding the cell types that express matriptase and where the active matriptase encounters these serpins.
PMC2518410	D02000	The activated matriptase found in these serpin-complexes could be produced by cell types other than mammary epithelial cells.
PMC2518410	D02009	Therefore, an appealing hypothesis for the presence of both free and matriptase-complexed ATIII and α1AT in human milk is that matriptase is activated in migrating leukocytes and/or plasma cells when these cells are extravasating and migrating through the basement membrane of capillaries in the lactating mammary gland, where both serpins are deposited.
PMC2518410	D03003	The presence of matriptase-α2AP complexes in the absence of free α2AP in human milk suggests that α2AP may be expressed by the same cells that are expressing and activating matriptase, resulting in the formation of α2AP complexes before shedding into the extracellular milieu, in a fashion similar to HAI-1.
PMC2518410	D04003	In the case of the 110-kDa matriptase-serpin complexes, the covalent linkage between the reactive centers of the serpins and active site triad serine of matriptase held both proteins together under boiled and nonreduced conditions (Fig. 2).
PMC2518410	D04004	The binding, inhibition, and trapping of serine proteases by serpins likely significantly disrupts the active site triad and substrate binding pocket of proteases since the activation-associated epitope recognized by the mAb M69 is no longer present on the 110-kDa complexes (Figs. 2 and ​and55).
PMC2518410	D05000	In summary, in this study, we have purified three novel matriptase complexes containing secreted serpins.
PMC2518410	D05002	In addition, the presence of free, active matriptase in the extracellular milieu and the formation of matriptase-serpin complexes suggest that these serpins could be useful tools to detect active matriptase in those cells that express very low levels of or no HAI-1.

PMC2518410	I00005	More recently, significant expression correlation between matriptase and HAI-1 at the RNA level was further emphasized by a transcriptional profiling study with the use of microarray data from 2,000 human normal and cancerous samples, including tumor samples from 18 different tissue types, 59 cancer-derived cell lines, and 86 types of nonpathogenic tissues (4).
PMC2518410	I01009	Matriptase activity that is only partially opposed by endogenous HAI-1 causes increased carcinogen sensitivity and produces spontaneous tumorigenesis in the skin of keratin-5-matriptase transgenic mice (21).
PMC2518410	I01012	Enforced expression of matriptase in breast cancer cell lines that do not naturally express the enzyme only results in the production of significant amounts of protein when HAI-1 is coexpressed (24, 27).
PMC2518410	I01016	Consistent with the dual roles of HAI-1 as a conventional protease inhibitor and as a cofactor for matriptase zymogen activation, activated matriptase has been consistently detected in HAI-1 complexes (3, 14).
PMC2518410	I02003	Similar imbalances between matriptase and HAI-1 expression have been noted in other cancers of epithelial origin, particularly in the context of more advanced or aggressive disease, suggesting that this imbalance may play a significant role in carcinogenesis and tumor progression (28).
PMC2518410	I03003	Matriptase mRNA is present in mouse peritoneal macrophages but not in bone marrow macrophages; however, HAI-1 is not detectable in macrophages of either type (4).
PMC2518410	I03004	These data and the finding that some tumors of epithelial origin apparently express matriptase in the absence of HAI-1 suggest that there must be a HAI-1-independent mechanism at work that can facilitate the expression, trafficking, activation, and inhibition of matriptase in these cells.
PMC2518410	I03005	HAI-1-independent matriptase expression by cells may lead to the release of active, non-HAI-1-complexed matriptase.
PMC2518410	I04000	In the present study, we identified novel matriptase-containing complexes in human milk that contain no HAI-1.
PMC2518410	I04002	The existence of these matriptase-serpin complexes in human milk suggests that serpins may play an important role in regulating the activity of matriptase, particularly in the context of cell types that express matriptase in the absence of measurable HAI-1.
PMC2518410	R00001	Although the physiological role of matriptase zymogen activation during lactation remains to be determined, human milk is apparently one of the best systems in which to characterize the diverse roles of this type 2 transmembrane serine protease.
PMC2518410	R00006	In contrast, the minor 110-kDa matriptase-containing complexes apparently do not contain HAI-1 since they were not detected by the HAI-1 mAb M19 (Fig. 1B).
PMC2518410	R01008	These activated matriptase-specific mAbs have been used in our previous studies for the characterization of matriptase activation in vivo and in vitro (1, 2, 8, 13, 14, 16).
PMC2518410	R01009	When both the 110-kDa and 95-kDa matriptase complexes were incubated with Sepharose beads linked to the activated matriptase-specific mAb M69, only 95-kDa matriptase-HAI-1 complexes and not the 110-kDa complexes were immunodepleted from the solution (Fig.
PMC2518410	R01020	The differential binding of both matriptase-containing complexes to the HAI-1 mAb not only demonstrates the novelty of the 110-kDa matriptase-containing complexes but also provides the biochemical means for the separation and purification of the novel matriptase-containing complexes from the predominant HAI-1-containing complexes.
PMC2518410	R02000	We further purified the novel matriptase-containing complexes from the 110-kDa complex-enriched CM-Sepharose column fractions by using a matriptase mAb 21-9-Sepharose immunoaffinity column after removal of the matriptase-HAI-1 complexes with an immobilized HAI-1 mAb M19 immunoaffinity column (Fig. 2B).
PMC2518410	R03004	Interestingly, the five tryptic peptides derived from the 80-kDa bands, which matched to matriptase, were all located within the serine protease domain of matriptase, whereas, the matriptase-matching tryptic peptides from the 45-kDa bands were all localized in the noncatalytic domains of matriptase.
PMC2518410	R03005	These data suggest that the 110-kDa complexes contain disulfide-linked, two-chain, activated matriptase.
PMC2518410	R03006	Considering the molecular mass of the three serpins identified (∼55 kDa for ATIII, ∼60 kDa for α1AT, and ∼70 kDa for α2AP) and of the serine protease domain of matriptase (25 kDa), it seems very likely that the 80-kDa bands are composed of three different complexes of the matriptase serine protease domain with one or other of these three serpins.
PMC2518410	R04003	The matriptase mAb M32 did not interact with these three serpin proteins (Fig. 4A, lanes 2, 3, and 4); the serpin polyclonal antibodies only interacted with their corresponding proteins and not the other serpins (Fig. 4, B–D, lanes 2, 3, and 4).
PMC2518410	R05001	This unique feature of serpin-type inhibitors is consistent with the resistance to dissociation by boiling SDS in the absence of reducing agents exhibited by the 110-kDa matriptase-serpin complexes (Fig. 2).
PMC2518410	R05003	After releasing the 45-kDa matriptase noncatalytic domain, the 110-kDa complexes were converted into 80-kDa complexes consisting of the matriptase serine protease domain covalently linked with either ATIII, α1AT, or α2AP.
PMC2518410	R06001	Matriptase was detected predominantly in its 95-kDa HAI-1 complexes and also as a minor species at 110-kDa, which may represent a mixture of matriptase complexes with the individual secreted serpins (Fig. 5, lane 1).
PMC2518410	R06003	The activated matriptase-specific mAb M69, only detected the 95-kDa matriptase-HAI-1 complexes (Fig. 5, lane 2), further confirmed that there was no free, active matriptase in human milk.
PMC2518410	R07003	Western blotting with the matriptase mAb M32 revealed that THP-1, human monocytic cells, and two Burkitt's lymphoma cells, Daudi and ST486, were positive for the protease, whereas the seven others were negative (Fig. 6).
PMC2518410	R07004	Although low levels of HAI-1 were detected in some cells that express no matriptase, neither Daudi nor ST486 cell lines coexpressed HAI-1 with matriptase.

Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 and the far upstream element-binding proteins (FUSE-BP) 1 and 2 were identified as new antigens.
PMC2688184	A02002	Post-translational protein modifications were analyzed and potentially deiminated peptides were found on aldolase, α-enolase, PGK1, calreticulin, HSP60 and the FUSE-BPs.

PMC2736765	D01004	From the bioinformatic analysis of the MS data, the three peptides more prevalent in the urine of case patients were concluded to be derived from the ZO-3, cadherin-like protein FAT tumor suppressor 2, and inositol pentakisphosphate 2-kinase.

Figure 3 shows a representative LC-MS/MS spectra used to identify the 1838.851 m/z peptide as IPP2K. As noted already, the urinary presence of peptide 983.534 (ZO-3) and 1838.851 (inositol pentakisphosphate 2-kinase) was strongly and independently associated with the presence of ERFD.

PMC2831859	R00004	Identification of aldose reductase and SOD2 was further confirmed by Western blot (Supplemental Figure 1).
PMC2831859	R01002	Podocyte biotin labeling confirmed presence of SOD2 and aldose reductase on plasma membrane (Supplemental Figure 1A).
PMC2831859	R02001	aldose reductase and SOD2 analysis was extended to determine their serum titer, renal expression, and co-localization within glomerular structures with IgG4.
PMC2831859	R03001	The assay was based on dot-blot analysis with peroxidase detection of IgG1 to 4 linked to membrane-fixed antigens.
PMC2831859	R03002	The assay (see the Concise Methods section and supplemental material), using recombinant aldose reductase (r-AR) or SOD2 (r-SOD2) spotted as antigens, proved to be sensitive to the nanogram level.
PMC2831859	R04000	We investigated renal expression of aldose reductase and SOD2 by immunofluorescence (IF) on renal tissues from patients with MN, minimal-change disease (MCD), or IgA nephropathy or normal patients using commercially available polyclonal anti-SOD2 antibody and highly purified polyclonal anti-AR (provided by P. Kador; see supplemental material).
PMC2831859	R05003	Patients with type 2 diabetes (n = 2) showed a mild mesangial expression of aldose reductase (data not shown) and no expression of SOD2.
PMC2831859	R06001	Quantitative analysis of aldose reductase and SOD2 expression was assessed through IF morphometric evaluation (Figure 3, O and P).
PMC2831859	R07006	IEM clearly indicated presence of both aldose reductase and SOD2 within subepithelial immune deposits.
PMC2831859	R08000	Confocal microscopy further confirmed IEM results and specifically indicated co-localization of aldose reductase with both IgG4 (Figure 6, A through C and p1) and C5b-9 (Figure 7, A through C and p1) and SOD2 with the same IgG4 and C5b-9 (Figures 6, D through F and p2, and ​and7,7, D through F and p2) along GBM deposits.
PMC2831859	R09004	Overall and with the exception of vimentin, which is a cytoskeletal protein, aldose reductase and SOD2 concentration was comparable with the other components, supporting that they are major antigens in MN.
PMC2831859	R11004	Increase of aldose reductase expression on plasma membrane was not evident (Figure 11C) and was only minimally appreciable in the cytoplasm (Supplemental Figure 7).
PMC2835760	A01002	We identified phosphoglycerate kinase (PGKC), heat shock protein (HSP70), and histones H2B and H3 as possible candidate diagnostic antigens.
PMC2835760	D03003	[15] was biased by design towards abundant proteins, and the final list included mitochondrial HSP70, a ribosomal protein, a paraflagellar rod protein and two other flagellar proteins, as well as glycosomal phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase.

PMC2835760	R02005	By aligning the blots with the protein stain, we estimated that this band could either be phosphoglycerate kinase (PGKC), or another protein of similar molecular weight.
PMC2835760	R06002	Purified PGKC was available, and we expressed HSP70 as a recombinant protein, fused to glutathione S transferase (glutathione-S-transferase), and also made His-tagged histone H2B and histone H3.
PMC2842036	A00005	We find internal cleavages in plasma proteins created by endo- and exopeptidases, providing information about the activities of proteolytic enzymes in blood, which may be correlated with disease states.
PMC2842036	A00006	We also find signatures of signal peptide cleavage, coagulation and complement activation, and other known proteolytic processes, in addition to a large number of cleavages that have not been reported previously, including over 200 cleavages of blood proteins by aminopeptidases.
PMC2842036	A00007	Finally, we can identify substrates from specific proteases by exogenous addition of the protease combined with N-terminal isolation and quantitative mass spectrometry.

PMC2842036	R00004	Subtiligase exhibits absolute specificity for N-terminal α-amines over lysine ϵ-amines, making it an excellent tool for N-terminal labeling.
PMC2842036	R00005	Our group has previously described a subtiligase-based method for labeling, isolation, and enrichment of protein N termini in cell lysates (10).
PMC2842036	R02003	It is possible that some of these cleavages represent nonspecific cleavage of abundant proteins by blood proteases, although it is notable that the correlation between number of N termini discovered and protein abundance is weak.
PMC2842036	R05000	Most blood proteins are subject to proteolytic cleavage by a multitude of proteases in the secretory pathway and the extracellular environment.
PMC2842036	R09002	After an activating cleavage to C3a and C3b by C3 convertase complexes, factor I and other enzymes inactivate C3b by additional cleavages.
PMC2842036	R10005	For plasma and serum, subtiligase labeling has some advantage in that it does not rely on the absolute efficiency of internal peptide depletion or lysine blocking.
PMC2842036	R11001	Subtiligase is very promiscuous toward N-terminal sequences, but it disfavors certain N-terminal residues, including acidic side chains and proline (9).
PMC2842036	R11002	Several abundant serum proteins, including serum albumin and apolipoprotein A-I, have acidic N-terminal residues and are not efficiently labeled by subtiligase, reducing their relative abundance in our experiments.
PMC2842036	R13000	Specific proteases may be up-regulated in diverse disease states, and their activity may leave a mark on the plasma proteome.
PMC2842036	R14001	Tempst and coworkers have recently correlated exoprotease activities in blood to metastatic cancer (28).
PMC2842036	R15001	Apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death implicated in the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation, is executed by a family of cysteine proteases called caspases (25).
PMC2842036	R15002	Products of caspase proteolysis could serve as markers of successful cancer therapy.
PMC2842036	R15006	This cleavage has been reported in cell culture screens for apoptotic caspase substrates (10).
PMC2842036	R15007	In addition to this putative caspase-derived peptide, we also find some intracellular proteins with internal proteolytic cleavages, including abundant cellular proteins such as actin, as well as less abundant proteins, including the Ran-specific GTPase activating protein.
PMC2842036	R18000	In addition to identifying proteolyzed products generally present in blood, our method can also be used to identify substrates of specific proteases.
PMC2842036	R19002	However, MT-SP1 has also been shown to process a number of other substrates, including prohepatocyte growth factor activator, prourokinase plasminogen activator, and protease activated receptor 2 (39).
PMC2842036	R22000	N termini that increase in abundance after addition of MT-SP1 are not necessarily direct substrates of the protease.
PMC2842036	R22007	This observation is consistent with an active interplay between endo- and exoproteases in blood.

PMC2860233	R05002	We searched for parameters using a forward stepwise selection procedure by AIC from all the clinical and laboratory data listed in Table II (available for all 304 cases) and found that a combination of α1-antitrypsin, alkaline phosphatase, leukocyte count, and ECOG performance status provided the lowest AIC value.

PMC2889050	I00012	A limitation of PAK4 siRNA knockdown is that PAK4 has been reported to have functions dependent on and independent of kinase activity (22, 26).

PMC2889050	I01001	However, most details regarding PAK4 biology, including the nature of pathways controlling tumor cell growth and survival, are largely unknown, and no potent inhibitors of PAK-family kinases have been reported.
PMC2889050	R00001	PF-3758309 was kinetically determined to be a potent, ATP-competitive inhibitor in a PAK4-kinase domain biochemical assay
PMC2889050	R00012	Using peptide substrates, PF-3758309 had similar enzymatic potency against the kinase domains of the other group B PAKs (PAK5, Ki = 18.1 ± 5.1 nM; PAK6, Ki = 17.1 ± 5.3 nM) and group A PAK1 (Ki = 13.7 ± 1.8 nM), but was less active against the other two group A PAKs (PAK2, IC50 = 190 nM; PAK3, IC50 = 99 nM).
PMC2889050	R01008	Transfection of A549 tumor cells with 100 nM PAK4 siRNA resulted in 45% of A549 cells positive for caspase 3 activation at 72 h, whereas A549 cells transfected with control siRNAs showed less than 0.29% of cells with activated caspase 3 staining (SI Appendix).

PMC2889050	R03000	To begin to understand the potential range of biological activities, PF-3758309 was broadly profiled in enzymatic assays of recombinant kinase domains.
PMC2889050	R03001	PF-3758309 was screened at a permissive ATP concentration (Km) against 146 of the 518 known human kinases to estimate off-target activities with a potential for cellular activity (IC50 < 5,000 nM) assuming ATP-competitive inhibition, published Km,ATP values, and a cellular ATP concentration of 2 mM (SI Materials and Methods).
PMC2889050	R04005	Related potent pyrrolopyrazole inhibitors designed to inhibit PKC (36) (e.g., PF-04577806) did not inhibit PAK4 (PAK4, Ki = 52 μM, pGEF-H1 cellular IC50 = 10 μM), nor did they modulate any of the assays that constitute the PAK4 signature at 1 μM. As PF-3758309 had biochemical activity toward Src-family kinases in vitro, we compared PF-3758309 cellular signaling activity with the well-characterized Src-family inhibitor Dasatinib (Fig. 2).
PMC2889050	R05009	The observed inhibition of Mnk1/p38α complexes (Fig. 2) may also be linked to PAK biology: Mnk was previously shown to be phosphorylated by caspase-activated PAK2 and an unidentified cdc42-dependent kinase (39).
PMC2889050	R06011	In addition, PAK-family kinases and p53 expression have been reported to be coregulated (43, 44).
PMC2889050	R06013	Nevertheless, our results are consistent with PAK4, and by extension certain Rho GTPases, as upstream regulators of p53, and also indicate that pharmacologic modulation of p53 does not directly affect PAK4 expression or activity in these settings.
PMC2889050	R08007	PF-3758309 treatment showed a significant increase in the apoptotic marker activated caspase 3 in HCT116 tumors (Fig. 4), which was also observed in cellular studies (Fig. 2).

PMC2909202	I01004	Due to the restricted homology with well-characterized kinase domains, the FIKK proteins did not cluster within any of the kinase groups described in higher eukaryotes [19].
PMC2909202	I02000	In this work, we have analyzed the biological role of two members of the P. falciparum FIKK kinase family (FIKK7.1 and FIKK12) in IEs.

PMC2909202	R02000	Given the transit of several FIKK kinases via Maurer's clefts and the presence of a variable N-terminal domain in each protein we hypothesized that the kinase activity of these proteins might be involved in the trafficking of parasite-encoded variant surface molecules, such as the adhesion molecule Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1).

PMC3031520	I02002	However, the γ-glutamyl-ε-lysine cross-links are also elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia [15], indicating that increased transglutaminase activity is a common phenomenon in a variety of neurodegenerative disease and not specifically for HD
PMC3063153	A00004	Included in this differential set were Parkinson disease autosomal recessive, early onset 7 (PARK 7) and Alpha Synuclein (aSyn), both of which are known to be pathognomonic to Parkinson's disease as well as metabolic enzymes like Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (NP) which has been exploited as therapeutic target in cancers.
PMC3063153	A00008	Overall, this study for the first time describes elevated levels of aSyn in PDAC as well as highlights the potential of evaluating Nucleoside Phosphorylase protein expression and levels of its downstream metabolites to develop a multiplex panel for non-invasive detection of PDAC.
PMC3063153	D00020	However, the exact mechanism by which PARK-7 exerts its oncogenic effect is not clearly understood, although it is presumed to involve p38 mitogen activated-protein kinase signaling [60].
PMC3063153	D01001	One of these was Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (NP), the rate limiting enzyme in salvage pathway involving purines, which is operational during inflammation as well as neoplastic progression, and has been highly targeted by various chemotherapeutic agents [61], [62], [63].
PMC3063153	D01004	NP expression has also been used to determine the clinical severity of various types of leukemias and lymphomas especially as a ratio to adenosine deaminase (ADA)[64].
PMC3063153	D01010	Thus there are strong correlates to suggest that antecedent chronic inflammation could be a known factor to develop PanIN or PDAC and Nucleoside Phosphorylase may be a useful marker to monitor the progression from inflammation to PDAC.
PMC3063153	D02007	Furthermore, it will be interesting to focus future investigations on evaluating the potential of Nucleoside Phosphorylase to predict PDAC's with antecedent chronic pancreatitis and the influence on the development of PanINs in the inflammatory milieu.

PMC3063153	I01015	The latter included Alpha-Synuclein (aSyn) and metabolic enzymes like Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (NP), both of which were elevated in pancreatic juice from patients with PDAC compared to benign controls.
PMC3063153	I01020	Also higher expression of Nucleoside Phosphorylase coupled to elevated levels of its down-stream metabolites, in serum had the potential to distinguish PDAC patients from benign controls, highlighting their biomarker potential.
PMC3063153	R00006	Importantly, our data suggests existence of a Parkinson's disease protein signature in PDAC and describes the combined ability of Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase protein and its regulated metabolites in serum to distinguish PDAC patients from benign individuals.
PMC3063153	R01005	The latter included Alpha-Synuclein (aSyn) that is known to be associated with Parkinson's Disease [37], [38], [39], as well as proteins like Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (Nucleoside Phosphorylase), Valosin Containing Protein (VCP), Thrombospondin-1(THBS1) etc, all of which were found to be elevated in PDAC-derived juice specimens.
PMC3063153	R03012	Accordingly, levels of 7 metabolites namely adenine, adenosine, guanine, guanosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine and inosine which are either substrates or products of Nucleoside Phosphorylase were measured in PDAC and benign sera using targeted LC-MS/MS.
PMC3063158	A00001	Among them, the insensitive acetylcholinesterase (ace-1R allele) is widespread worldwide and confers cross-resistance to organophosphates and carbamates.

PMC3063158	I00002	Unfortunately, resistance to insecticides in C. quinquefasciatus mosquitoes emerged more than 25 years ago in Africa, America and Europe and this resistance is frequently due to a loss of sensitivity of the insect's acetylcholinesterase enzyme to organophosphates and carbamates [4].
PMC3063158	R03002	Other salivary proteins were identified including apyrase, 5′nucleotidase, antigen 5 family (30 kDa Cq, AG5-3) and adenosine deaminase, which is believed to be involved in blood feeding (Figure 3, Table 1).
PMC3063158	R04001	These proteins were identified as endoplasmin, triosephosphate isomerase and a heat shock protein (HSP83).
PMC3063158	R04003	Among other housekeeping proteins, the salivary endonuclease which belongs to the hydrolase family was also identified (Table 1): this protein is believed to reduce local blood viscosity at the bite site to enhance the feeding process [31].
PMC3066142	A01001	Treatment with trypsin, or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PiPLC), only minimally impaired membrane integrity.

PMC3066142	A03002	We have investigated whether any proteins were exposed on the surface of live worms using incubation with selected hydrolases, in combination with mass spectrometry to identify released proteins.
PMC3066142	D01001	Thus the detection of proteins such as α2-macroglobulin, saposin B, and hemoglobinase (asparaginyl endopeptidase) in the two enzymatic shaving experiments was to be expected.

PMC3067499	R06014	Previous work has shown that short synthetic peptides based on authentic PfSUB1 cleavage sites can act as good substrates for the protease, so to test our predictions, peptides based on the two predicted MSRP2 sites were assayed for sensitivity to cleavage.
PMC3067499	R07005	The protease that mediates this cleavage is unknown.
PMC3068262	A01005	Telomerase activity in SW1116cells was checked by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.
PMC3068262	A02006	The proteomic analysis showed that the 26 protein spots were differently expressed in SW1116 cells and 10 protein spots were identified as ubiquitin fusion-degradation 1-like protein, nuclear chloride channel protein, tubulin β, Raichu404X, stratifin, F-actin capping protein α-1 subunit, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 delta isoform 2, hypothetical protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and guanine nucleotide binding protein β polypeptide 2-like 1, respectively.

PMC3071361	A00005	Actin-rich cytoskeleton components, GTPases from the Rac and Rab families, filamin, α-actinin and a newly identified ezrin-moesin-radixin protein were the main factors found to potentially interact with capped receptors.
PMC3071361	A00006	A set of specific cysteine proteases and a serine protease were enriched in isolated uropod fractions.
PMC3071361	A00007	However, biological assays indicated that cysteine proteases are not involved in uropod formation in E. histolytica, a fact in contrast to the situation in human motile immune cells.
PMC3071361	A01005	In addition to the presence of several proteases and novel cytoskeleton factors, our proteomic results highlight the presence of important surface components including the Gal/GalNAc lectin, calreticulin, several adhesion molecules and the immunodominant antigen M17.
PMC3071361	A01007	Firstly, cysteine proteases are not involved in uropod formation in E. histolytica.
PMC3071361	D03003	The protease then cleaves the four last amino acids of the β2-chain, resulting in its binding to talin - a crucial step in uropod elongation and cell polarization [23].
PMC3071361	D03005	Alternatively, other proteases may have a role in uropod formation, despite the fact that knockdown of the rhomboid serine protease (which specifically localizes at the base of the cap, rather than in the cap itself) had no significant impact on cap formation [65].
PMC3071361	D03006	The fact that cysteine proteinases from the C family were highly represented in the UEF make these factors relevant for further analysis.
PMC3071361	D03007	Although cysteine proteases has been found into internal vesicles and/or on the amoebic surface, little is known about the potential association of trafficking vesicles and uropod membranes and/or subcortical cytoskeleton, but we cannot exclude this possibility.

PMC3071361	I02015	Insight into the capping process's mechanism has also been gained recently: a serine protease from the rhomboid family concentrates in the vicinity of the uropod and cleaves the Gal/GalNAc HgL subunit in vitro[21].
PMC3071361	I02016	These findings highlight the potential role of a large number of amoebic proteases in surface receptor capping and uropod formation.
PMC3071361	I02017	Functional links between proteinases and uropod formation have also been observed in other eukaryotic cells.
PMC3071361	I02018	For instance, leukocyte migration is promoted by the activity of cathepsin X, a cysteine peptidase localized at the uropod and which modulates the interaction between β2 integrin and the actin-rich cytoskeleton [22], [23].
PMC3071361	I03001	These cytoskeleton functions are regulated by a panel of important proteins, including the small GTPases RacG
PMC3071361	I03003	[28], their corresponding GTP exchange factors [29], [30], [31], the PAK kinases [32],
PMC3071361	I04002	In addition, our results also suggest the presence of immunodominant variable surface antigen M17 [35], a number of proteins involved in multiple drug resistance [36] , a set of specific ATPases, a number of small GTPases, cysteine proteases, at the uropod enriched fractions.
PMC3071361	I04003	Given the potential roles of immunodominant M17 antigen and cysteine proteases in the pathogenesis of amoebiasis, we verified the enrichment of M17 at uropod and investigated the potential roles cysteine proteases in uropod formation, using cell biology approaches.
PMC3071361	M00003	100 µM of both E64 were used, at this concentration the enzymatic activity of cysteine proteases is inhibited by 95% as measured by the degradation of the synthetic substrate Z-RR-AMC (Sigma) (data not shown).
PMC3071361	R02006	Signalling molecules accounted for a significant proportion of the UEF proteome, with the most numerous being small GTPases from the Rho and Rab families.
PMC3071361	R02009	Surface molecules, cytoskeletal proteins and amoebic proteases were also identified.
PMC3071361	R02011	We further characterized the surface proteins, the cytoskeleton proteins and the proteinases since these categories are potentially involved in the surface receptor capping process and the anti-amoeba immune reactions (Table 1).
PMC3071361	R02012	In addition to the stringency of protein selection, one important criteria allowing us to goes further in this analysis was the fact that for example surface antigens such ARIEL [40], kinase receptors abundant family [41] or β-tubulin (nucleus marker) were not present in this proteomic analysis indicating that we have in the analyzed fraction proteins mostly linked to UEF.
PMC3071361	R03013	It has a signal peptide and seven furin-like cysteine rich regions that is found in a variety of proteins and involved in signal transduction via receptors tyrosine kinase
PMC3071361	R04003	[26], the small GTPase Rac G [27], guanine exchange factors [29], filamin [34] and α-actinin [19].
PMC3071361	R04010	Spectrin family proteins and the associated kinases are known to redistribute to the uropod following T cell activation during the onset of inflammation [51].
PMC3071361	R05000	Proteases were another category of the main factors found in the UEF (Table 2).
PMC3071361	R05001	The cysteine proteases were all endopeptidases (seven in total): CP-A1, CP-A2 and CP-A5 from the very well known A family and CP-C4, C5, -C6 and -C13 from the C family.
PMC3071361	R05003	Several studies have shown that peptidases (particularly cysteine peptidases) are major pathogenicity factors in E. histolytica[54].
PMC3071361	R05006	This protease contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) integrin binding motif which has also been found in the proregion of cathepsin X from higher eukaryotes [57].
PMC3071361	R05009	In addition to cysteine proteinases, we also identified Sp2 one of the members of a family of three amoebic serine proteases (i.e. S28 family)
PMC3071361	R05010	[58] and two dipeptidyl-peptidases from the lipase family which hydrolyze tryglycerides, phospholipids and cholesterol esters [59].
PMC3071361	R06001	The released surface proteins, cytoskeleton-related proteins and cysteine proteases identified herein might help us to understand the mechanism of surface receptor capping and uropod formation.
PMC3071361	R07001	Membrane-associated E. histolytica cysteine and serine proteases may have a role in the degradation of the tight junctions of target cells, since it has been reported that use of the corresponding inhibitors prevents this process [58], [60].
PMC3071361	R07002	Therefore, we sought to investigate whether or not cysteine proteases present in the UEF have hydrolytic activity and so determined the protease activity of this fraction in a gelatin gel assay (Figure 4A).
PMC3071361	R07003	The data evidenced a good correlation between the patterns generated by peptidases present in the UEF on one hand and the digestion pattern previously published carrying CP-A1, CP-A2 and CP-A5 activities on the other [61].
PMC3071361	R07013	This finding indicated that although cysteine proteinases are abundant and active in the uropod fraction, they do not influence the dynamics of receptor capping or uropod formation.
PMC3071361	R07014	Cysteine proteinases are important for pathogenicity in E. histolytica; given their abundance in the extruded amoebic uropod fractions, we expected them to have much the same functions in surface receptor capping and uropod formation as they do in leukocytes.
PMC3071361	R07015	However, inhibition of cysteine protease activity did not significantly modify the efficiency of cap formation and thus emphasized a contrast with the known role of cysteine peptidases in leukocyte uropod formation.
PMC308900	A00002	Towards this end, a 32-kDa putative glyoxalase in the culture filtrate (CF) of growing M. tuberculosis (originally annotated as Rv0577 and hereafter designated CFP32) was identified, cloned, and characterized.

PMC308900	F69002	High extracellular levels of Mycobacterium tuberculosis glutamine synthetase and superoxide dismutase in actively growing cultures are due to high expression and extracellular stability rather than to a protein-specific export mechanism.
PMC308900	R01002	The region upstream of cfp32 also contains several putative regulatory elements that are homologous to previously described mycobacterial −10 and −35 RNA polymerase contact sites (n = 3 and 5, respectively), including three −35 sites identified for the CF virulence factor katG (44; data not shown).
PMC308900	R01004	The biological significance of such an arrangement of two stop codons is not known but has been noted previously for the glutamine synthetase gene of M. tuberculosis, E. coli, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (27).
PMC308900	R02010	Remarkably, the alignment of CFP32 homologues revealed several highly conserved amino acids, several of which were also present in a surprising number of ostensibly paralogous glycosyl hydrolases (one example is given in Fig. ​Fig.3B).3B).
PMC308900	R02012	These aspartic acids were each in the context of a DPXG motif analogous to that for the determined enzymatic nucleophile (the residue that forms the enzyme-substrate intermediate during cleavage) of the well-characterized class II (family 38) α-mannosidases (32).
PMC308900	R02013	Compare human Golgi α-mannosidase II (PRSGWQIDPFGHSA), jack bean α-mannosidase (PRAGWAIDPFGHSP), CFP32 module 1 (GRMSFITDPTGAAV), and CFP32 module 2 (GRFAVLSDPQGAIF) whereby the conserved amino acids are in boldface and the nucleophiles (known and putative) are underlined.
PMC308900	R05007	Even so, there are several other known CF protein genes that do not code for the classical signal peptides, including superoxide dismutase (28), glutamine synthetase (27), and CFP29 (54) as well as ESAT-6 and CFP10 (65).
PMC308900	R11000	Previously, the coexpression of mRNA for IFN-γ with IL-10, IL-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, by lung cells from patients with active pulmonary TB, was described [48; M. D. Bonecini-Almeida, J. R. Lapa e Silva, S. Nicholson, J. Geng, N. Boechat, C. Linhares, L. Rego, and A. L. Kritski, abstract from the American Thoracic Society Annual Meeting 1997, Am.
PMC308900	R12001	This CFP32 protein appears to be a bimodular glyoxalase localized to both the cytosolic and CF compartments of M. tuberculosis.
PMC3098579	A00011	Furthermore, by using a highly selective inhibitor of the cysteine protease dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 3 (DPAP3) that has been shown to be a key regulator of host cell rupture, we were able to identify specific substrates whose processing may be of particular importance to the process of host cell rupture.
PMC3098579	A00013	These data also provide insight into the biochemical events that take place during host cell rupture and are likely to be valuable for the study of proteases that could potentially be targeted for therapeutic gain.

PMC3098579	F31002	A Plasmodium falciparum dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I participates in vacuolar hemoglobin degradation.
PMC3098579	I01000	A number of recent studies have determined that both serine and cysteine proteases are key regulators of host cell rupture (1–3).
PMC3098579	I01001	In particular, the serine protease subtilisin 1 (PfSUB1) (3) and the cysteine protease dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 3 (DPAP3)1 (1) have been found to be essential for parasite-mediated host cell rupture.
PMC3098579	I01006	In addition, such a map of proteolytic processing events may help to identify families of proteases that mediate these events.
PMC3098579	I01007	Protease targets that direct the processing of key proteolytic events required for host cell rupture would therefore be potentially valuable targets for new classes of antimalarial drugs.
PMC3098579	I02001	The past few years have seen a rapid growth in the development of methods to globally identify substrates of proteases.
PMC3098579	I03003	When a protein is processed by a protease, the location of the protein fragments in the gel often changes.
PMC3098579	R06001	We focused on the plasmepsins, falcipain-3, and SERA family proteases as each of these enzymes is processed in multiple locations during maturation to produce the active protease (3, 27, 28).
PMC3098579	R06003	3B lists the semitryptic peptides that we observed in our data set that matched the predicted peptides for each of the target proteases.
PMC3098579	R06004	We identified one of the sites of autocatalytic processing of falcipain-3 and one expected semitryptic peptide for each of two plasmepsin proteases (PF14_0075 and PF14_0078).
PMC3098579	R07004	4A shows peptographs comparing the T = −6 with T = 0 samples for the cysteine protease falcipain-3 (PF11_0162) for both the membrane and cytosolic fractions.
PMC3098579	R08004	A potential candidate for this event would be dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 1 (DPAP1), which is also present in the food vacuole and whose processing activity would likely be blocked after one cleavage event by the proline residues found in the N-terminal sequence.
PMC3098579	R09004	The semitryptic peptide in the most N-terminal peptide corresponds to the predicted cleavage site of subtilisin-1, a serine protease that was recently shown to be a key regulator of host cell rupture (3).
PMC3098579	R10004	To further characterize these, we chose to perform PROTOMAP analysis on samples of parasites that had been treated with a specific inhibitor of DPAP3, a cysteine protease that we previously showed is a key regulator of host cell rupture.
PMC3098579	R12003	This could be expected for a protease such as DPAP1 that is located in the food vacuole with a role in hemoglobin degradation (32).
PMC3100311	A00002	However other proteases, which activate during episodes of angioedema, might also contribute to BK production.
PMC3100311	D00003	Upon such binding the zymogen serine proteases autoactivate and initiate the effector phase of the complement cascade [11].
PMC3100311	D00009	It was shown however, that MASP-1 can augment the activity of MASP-2 either by activating zymogen MASP-2 or facilitating C3-convertase formation due to its C2 digesting activity [28], [34], [35].
PMC3100311	D00011	The crystal structure of MASP-1 [16] suggests that it has more relaxed substrate specificity than related complement proteases having only one or two natural substrates (e. g. C1r, C1s, MASP-2).
PMC3100311	D03008	Since MASP-1 autoactivates spontaneously in the absence of inhibitors, it is possible that this protease cleaves HK, even in the absence of any contact system activator, contributing to the elevated baseline level of BK observed in HAE patients [7], [42].

PMC3100311	I02006	MASP-1 however cannot induce C3-convertase formation alone, since it cannot cleave C4.
PMC3100311	R01000	C1-inhibitor is known to inhibit all 3 proteases [1], [4], [16], [17].
PMC3100311	R01001	In order to check weather C1-inhibitor is able to prevent cleavage of HK by rMASP-1, rMASP-2 or kallikrein, a molar excess of C1-inhibitor (compared to the protease) was added to HK before the addition of the protease to a set of samples.
PMC3100311	R05000	All proteases can cleave HK at other positions as well, since besides the BK peak, peaks of other unidentified peptides are present in the chromatograms (Figure 2).
PMC3100311	R09000	The HK preparations used can potentially contain contaminating proteases.
PMC3108827	A00007	In addition to previously reported proteins found in multiple sclerosis cerebrospinal fluid, such as αβ crystallin, enolase, and 14–3-3-protein, we have identified several additional molecules involved in mitochondrial and energy metabolism, myelin gene expression and/or cytoskeletal organization.
PMC3108827	A00008	These include aspartate aminotransferase, cyclophilin-A, quaking protein, collapsin response mediator protein-2, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, and cofilin.
PMC3108827	A00009	To further validate these findings, the cellular expression pattern of collapsin response mediator protein-2 and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 were investigated in human chronic-active MS lesions by immunohistochemistry.
PMC3108827	A00010	The observation that in multiple sclerosis lesions phosphorylated collapsin response mediator protein-2 was increased, whereas Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 was down-regulated, not only highlights the importance of these molecules in the pathology of this disease, but also illustrates the use of our approach in attempting to decipher the complex pathological processes leading to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases.
PMC3108827	D01003	In line with previous reports, molecules such as αβ-crystallin, enolase, 14–3-3 protein and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase were also identified (11, 15, 49) in the MS-CSF, thus validating our experimental approach.
PMC3108827	D02008	GAPDH, on the other hand is associated with γ-aminobutyric acid-type A receptors and functions as a kinase involved in maintaining γ-aminobutyric acid-type A receptors-mediated responses (55); inhibition of GAPDH activity leads to induction of apoptosis (56).
PMC3108827	D02012	The generation of reactive molecules, particularly antibodies to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, or PK could influence the activity of these molecules and potentially be of pathological significance.
PMC3108827	D02016	For example, whereas we have identified aldolase A, (another glycolytic enzyme) as a potential target, immunization of C57BL/6 and NOD mice or Lewis rats with this protein does not lead to the development of any diseases (59).
PMC3108827	D02017	Likewise, whereas antibodies to alpha-enolase are associated with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and mixed cryoglobulnemia, these are nonpathogenic (45).
PMC3108827	D03001	The presence of antibodies or other putative binding proteins could therefore inhibit the function of phosphoglycerate kinase and thus lead to impaired neural cell function.
PMC3108827	D03002	In addition to the glycolytic enzymes involved in the energy metabolism, creatine kinase B (CKB), a molecule involved in cellular energy homeostasis also reacted with MS-CSF (Table II, Figs. 3 and ​and4).4).

PMC3181243	A00002	While a serine peptidase with activity against insoluble elastin appears to be essential for this process in one species of schistosomes, Schistosoma mansoni, it is unknown whether other schistosome species use the same peptidase to facilitate entry into their hosts.
PMC3181243	A01000	Recent genome sequencing projects, together with a number of biochemical studies, identified alternative peptidases that Schistosoma japonicum or Trichobilharzia regenti could use to facilitate migration through skin.
PMC3181243	A01001	In this study, we used comparative proteomic analysis of human skin treated with purified cercarial elastase, the known invasive peptidase of S. mansoni, or S. mansoni cathespin B2, a close homolog of the putative invasive peptidase of S. japonicum, to identify substrates of either peptidase.
PMC3181243	A02000	This study demonstrates that an S. mansoni ortholog of the candidate invasive peptidase of S. japonicum and T. regenti, cathepsin B2, is capable of efficiently cleaving many of the same host skin substrates as the invasive serine peptidase of S. mansoni, cercarial elastase.
PMC3181243	A02001	At the same time, identification of unique substrates and the broader species specificity of cathepsin B2 suggest that the cercarial elastase gene family amplified as an adaptation of schistosomes to human hosts.
PMC3181243	A03001	In this paper, we have mined recent genome annotations of S. mansoni and S. japonicum, a zoonotic schistosome species, to identify differential expansion of peptidase gene families that may be involved in parasite invasion and subsequent migration through skin.
PMC3181243	A03002	Having identified a serine peptidase gene family in S. mansoni and a cysteine peptidase gene family in S. japonicum, we then used a comparative proteomic approach to identify potential substrates of representative members of both classes of enzymes from S. mansoni in human skin.
PMC3181243	A03003	The results of this study suggest that while these species evolved to use different classes of peptidases in host invasion, both are capable of cleaving components of the epidermis and dermal extracellular matrix, as well as proteins involved in the host immune response against the migrating parasite.
PMC3181243	D00000	In S. mansoni, the most abundant peptidase in cercarial secretions is a serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase (SmCE) for its ability to degrade insoluble elastin [8], [22].
PMC3181243	D00002	Here, we have shown that serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase cleaves additional substrates in skin, including several types of collagen, other extracellular matrix proteins, and components of the complement cascade.
PMC3181243	D01001	An expanded gene family was identified with ten individual genes that encode multiple isoforms of the peptidase.
PMC3181243	D01002	Even without a complete genome, multiple orthologs of serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase have been also been found in S. haematobium, a related human-specific species of schistosome common throughout North Africa and the Middle East
PMC3181243	D01007	While one report suggested that CE was detected by immunofluorescence in S. japonicum secretions, no cercarial elastase protein was detected in a high resolution mass spectrometric proteomic analysis of S. japonicum acetabular secretions, and no cercarial elastase-like activity was identified by direct biochemical assays
PMC3181243	D01009	Trichobilharzia regenti, an avian schistosome that is capable of invading human skin, but not establishing a successful infection in humans, encodes a cysteine peptidase, cathepsin B2 (TrCB2 (GenBank: ABS57370.1)), which has elastinolytic properties and localizes to the acetabular glands of the parasite [13].
PMC3181243	D02000	The differential use of these two classes of peptidases raises the question of how their respective pH optima are achieved in schistosome secretions.
PMC3181243	D02003	SmCE activity is optimal in a slightly alkaline environment, and S. mansoni secretions are also alkaline; therefore all serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase incubations were performed at pH 8 [29].
PMC3181243	D02005	The pH optimum of the cercarial elastase is 8, and the pH of the secretions is also alkaline [30].
PMC3181243	D02006	As S. mansoni cercariae migrate through skin, a microenvironment is created by the secreted material, which allows for optimal activity of the peptidase.
PMC3181243	D03002	While we cannot say conclusively that SjCB2 is the protease facilitating S. japonicum cercarial invasion, we believe that our study, along with previous work from other groups, supports the proposed role for cathepsin B2 in host skin protein degradation [12], [13].
PMC3181243	D04000	This conclusion, that S. japonicum uses a cathepsin B2 peptidase for skin invasion, while S. mansoni uses a serine peptidase (serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase), has implications for the evolution of the human host-parasite relationship in schistosomiasis.
PMC3181243	D04004	While the genome of the other “humanized” parasite, S. haematobium, has not been completed, it is already clear from EST analysis that more abundant serine peptidase isoforms are present in that genome [15].
PMC3181243	D05000	What is the advantage of a larval serine peptidase for the “humanized” schistosomes?
PMC3181243	D05001	It is interesting to note that by BLAST analysis, some of the proteins with highest homology to cercarial elastase are mammalian mast cell peptidases, which are present in skin [12].
PMC3181243	D05002	It is therefore possible that cercarial elastase evolved by convergence to resemble a human peptidase, in order to evade detection by the host immune system.
PMC3181243	D05005	Cathepsin B2 is a likely target of the inflammatory response, given that many cysteine peptidases are allergenic [36].
PMC3181243	D05006	Perhaps the rapid transit of non-humanized cercariae through skin precludes the need for an invasive enzyme that mimics a host peptidase.
PMC3181243	D05008	C3 and C4 components bind to the tegument of schistosomes, but are degraded by both serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase and SmCB2 [26], [37].
PMC3181243	D06001	Many skin proteins are substrates for both enzymes, but cathepsin B2 appears to cleave a broader range of substrates, and therefore may be a more effective invasive enzyme than cercarial elastase.

PMC3181243	I01003	These include histolytic peptidases [6], [7].
PMC3181243	I01004	The most abundant peptidase in S. mansoni secretions is an S1A serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase (SmCE) (GenBank: AAC46967.1) that has activity against insoluble elastin and other fibrillar macromolecules of skin [8].
PMC3181243	I01005	Biochemical and immunolocalization studies have confirmed serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase activity in cercarial secretions [9], [10].
PMC3181243	I01006	Moreover, applying an irreversible serine peptidase inhibitor to ex vivo skin before exposure to cercariae blocks the majority of larvae from invading, suggesting that this serine peptidase has an essential role in skin penetration [11].
PMC3181243	I02000	While the serine peptidase, cercarial elastase, plays a key role in S. mansoni skin invasion, the zoonotic species S. japonicum has no serine peptidases in its larval secretions.
PMC3181243	I02001	S. japonicum, however, encodes a number of isoforms of cathepsin B2 (SjCB2) (GenBank: CAA50305.1), a cysteine peptidase, which are secreted by the invading parasite [12].
PMC3181243	I02004	Given that T. regenti also appears to utilize cathepsin B2 for skin invasion, these observations suggest that the use of a serine peptidase in invasion is the exception, not the rule, among parasitic schistosomes.
PMC3181243	I02005	The use of cercarial elastase may reflect unique properties required by S. mansoni to preferentially infect human hosts.
PMC3181243	I03000	To confirm that cathepsin B2 is also capable of facilitating skin invasion, we used a proteomic approach to identify potential substrates in host skin, for both S. mansoni cercarial elastase and S. mansoni cathepsin B2 (SmCB2) (GenBank: CAC85211.2), a close homolog of S. japonicum CB2.
PMC3181243	I03002	We therefore chose to use a proteomic approach to validate the roles of these peptidases in skin invasion.
PMC3181243	I04000	We found that the vast majority of cleaved proteins resulting from human skin exposure to either purified serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase or SmCB2 overlap, suggesting that both enzymes are capable of facilitating parasite migration through skin.
PMC3181243	I04002	Candidate substrates were further validated by in vitro cleavage of purified human skin proteins with either peptidase.
PMC3181243	M00000	To determine the number of cercarial elastase and cathepsin B2 protein isoforms in schistosome species, all full-length protein sequences (i.e., those possessing the full catalytic core of the peptidase) were collected from both GenBank (NCBI) and S. japonicum and S. mansoni genome annotation websites (Sanger Institute GeneDB).
PMC3181243	M01006	For confirmation of protein identification, bands corresponding to the correct molecular weight of serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase were excised from the gel, and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, followed by LC-MS/MS peptide sequencing, described below.
PMC3181243	M03003	Enzyme concentration was measured by active site titration using the cysteine peptidase inhibitor CAO74 (N-(L-3-trans-propylcarbamoyloxirane-2- carbonyl)-L-isoleucyl-L-proline).
PMC3181243	M05002	To each of these skin sections 100 µl of digestion solution containing either peptidase or inhibited peptidase at 1.8 µM was added, along with corresponding controls.
PMC3181243	M05004	Inhibited SmCE was prepared by incubating 1.8 µM serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase with 2 µM AAPF-CMK for one hour at room temperature; inhibition was monitored against AAPF-pNA, prior to its addition to skin.
PMC3181243	M08004	Both enzymes were also pre-incubated with 1 mM CAO74 (SmCB2) or 1 mM AAPF-CMK (serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase) for one hour at room temperature prior to their addition to collagen.
PMC3181243	R00000	To outline the molecular evolution of larval peptidases in schistosomes, all previously reported orthologs were re-examined (Figure 1).
PMC3181243	R00003	No cercarial elastase genes have been detected in any Trichobilharzia species.
PMC3181243	R01005	A full list of schistosome cercarial elastase and cathepsin B isoforms is provided as supplementary material (Tables S1 and S2).
PMC3181243	R02004	S. mansoni cathepsin B2 has high homology to the S. japonicum cathepsin B2 (90% sequence identity and 94% sequence similarity for the mature peptidase, see Figure S4), including the active site and substrate binding pocket, and therefore is likely to display highly similar biochemical properties and substrate specificity [17].
PMC3181243	R02008	To ensure that equimolar amounts of active enzyme were added to skin samples, an active site titration was first performed for both serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase and SmCB2 with respective covalent inhibitors.
PMC3181243	R03002	Addition of both serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase and SmCB2 to skin led to the cleavage of collagen VI, which is found in interstitial tissue, and collagen XII, a collagen located in the basement membrane of the epidermis [23].
PMC3181243	R03005	Both vimentin and talin-1, cytoskeletal proteins that are associated with desmosomes, were cleaved upon addition of either peptidase.
PMC3181243	R04003	Complement C3, an integral component of both the classical and alternative complement activation pathways was cleaved upon addition of either serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase and SmCB2; complement C4A and complement D proteins, respective members of the classical and alternative complement activation pathways, were cleaved by SmCB2 alone.
PMC3181243	R05000	In addition to the extracellular proteins identified, many cytosolic proteins were also cleaved by either serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase or SmCB2.
PMC3181243	R06005	To confirm that the two peptidases cleaved collagen at unique sites, candidate lower molecular weight bands resulting from peptidase treatment were submitted for N-terminal sequencing, and the resulting amino acid sequence was mapped onto the full protein to determine cleavage sites (Figure 2C).
PMC3181243	R06006	Consistent with previous analysis of serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase substrate specificity, in vitro digestion of collagen I revealed that peptide bond cleavage only occurred following a leucine residue (VRGL/TGPI)
PMC3181243	R07002	Discrete lower molecular weight bands were visible within 1 hour of treatment with either peptidase, in comparison to inhibited peptidase controls (Figure 3A, B).
PMC3181243	R07003	N-terminal sequencing of selected fragments again revealed that both SmCE and SmCB2 digested the protein in a manner consistent with their known specificities, with an arginine in the P1 position (RR/SVQ) for SmCB2 and and a tyrosine in the P1 position (TMY/HAK) for serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase (Figure 3C).
PMC3188460	I00005	Recent evidence for saliva’s diagnostic capabilities include the identification of MMP-8 and -9 and osteoprotegrin as biomarkers for periodontal disease (Ramseier et al., 2009), changes in salivary inflammatory cytokine profiles in asthma exacerbations (Blicharz et al., 2009), salivary detection of HIV-1 (Liu et al., 2011), the correlation between salivary transcriptome markers KRAS, BMD3L2, ACRV1, and DPM1 and pancreatic cancer (Zhang et al., 2010), and salivary C-reactive protein, myoglobin, and myeloperoxidase biomarkers to detect acute myocardial infarction (Floriano et al., 2009).
PMC3188460	I00013	In addition, we used histatin 5, statherin, and proline-rich protein 1 (PRP1) as test proteins for monitoring salivary proteolysis, since these are natural salivary proteins that are quickly degraded by endogenous proteases in WS (Castagnola et al., 2004; Campese et al., 2009; Helmerhorst et al., 2010).
PMC3188460	R01010	The data confirmed the complete inhibition of salivary proteases at pH 3.0.
PMC3197112	A01001	Examples of these systems include immunoassays such as the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, gel electrophoresis assays, and mass spectrometry (MS).
PMC3200215	A00001	Inactivation of A-T-mutated protein (ATM), a multifunctional protein kinase, is responsible for A-T, yet biochemical studies have not succeeded in conclusively identifying the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the neurodegeneration seen in A-T patients or the proteins that can be used as biomarkers for neurologic assessment of A-T or as potential therapeutic targets.
PMC3200215	D03000	In this proteomic study, we did not detect A-T-related proteins, such as ATM-related protein kinases or their substrates [7].
PMC3200215	D11000	The remaining eight significantly changed proteins in the Priority group 1 are SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), neurosecretory protein VGF, TPP1 (cDNA FLJ56402, highly similar to tripeptidyl-peptidase 1), neurocan core protein, chromogranin A, cathepsin D, SOD3 (extracellular superoxide dismutase), and ENPP2 (isoform 1 of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 2) (Table 3).
PMC3200215	D14000	TPP1 (cDNA FLJ56402, highly similar to tripeptidyl-peptidase 1), also known as CLN2, is a member of the family of serine-carboxyl proteinases and plays a crucial role in lysosomal protein degradation; a deficiency in this enzyme leads to fatal neurodegenerative disease [58].

PMC3233585	A01004	Five of them were verified to be differentially up-regulated in individual plasma of AAA patients: adiponectin, extracellular superoxide dismutase, protein AMBP, kallistatin and carboxypeptidase B2.
PMC3233585	D04000	Of the 12 proteins detected by WB analysis, five appeared to be differentially up-regulated in plasma samples of AAA compared to control patients: adiponectin, extracellular superoxide dismutase, carboxypeptidase B2, kallistatin, and protein AMBP.
PMC3233585	D06001	WB analysis confirmed five PAcIFIC identified proteins as potential biomarkers for early AAA diagnosis (i.e. adiponectin, extracellular superoxide dismutase, kallistatin, carboxypeptidase B2, and protein AMBP).
PMC3233585	R02005	For example, using representative identified proteins with known plasma concentrations we detected proteins of the following concentrations: 72 kDa type IV collagenase (8.8E+03 pg/mL), L-selectin (1.7E+04 pg/mL), beta-2-microglobulin (1.1E+06 pg/mL), apolipoprotein E (3.4E+07 pg/mL), ceruloplasmin (2.1E+08 pg/mL), alpha-2-macroglobulin (1.4E+09 pg/mL) and albumin (4.0E+10 pg/mL).
PMC3233585	R06001	From this analysis, 19 proteins were identified in the following three categories as most likely related to putative AAA biological mechanisms: 1) vascular remodeling (vinculin, alpha-actinin-1, talin-1, gelsolin, adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1), profilin-1, and filamin-A), 2) intraluminal thrombus formation and coagulation (protein AMBP, extracellular superoxide dismutase, carboxypeptidase N catalytic chain (CPN1), carboxypeptidase B2, platelet basic protein, alpha-2-antiplasmin, pleckstrin, corticosteroid binding globulin, heparin cofactor 2, and kallistatin), and 3) inflammatory response (lysozyme C, and adiponectin).
PMC3233585	R07003	Specifically, adiponectin, kallistatin, extracellular superoxide dismutase, and carboxypeptidase B2 were detected as being abundant at significantly increased levels in AAA compared to control plasma samples.
PMC3235251	A02000	female plasma, vs. males contained pregnancy zone protein (419-580-fold), factor V (2-fold), α1-antitrypsin (2-fold), β2-microglobulin (2-fold), and complement factors H and C4B (1.5-2-fold) at significantly higher concentrations than males and males contained significant increases in Fc binding protein (2-fold), protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (2-fold), phosphatidylinositol-glycan specific phospholipase (4-fold), protein S-100 (3-fold) and transgelin-2 (14-fold) vs. females (p<.005).
PMC3235251	D00004	Males plasma showed an increase in Fc-binding protein, protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor, phosphatidylinositol-glycan specific phospholipase, protein S-100, and transgelin-2.
PMC3235251	D02000	α-1-antitrypsin is the best known serine protease inhibitor of the serpin family which has a structural conformation that allows it to bind tightly and inhibit serine proteases, including: neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3.21-23 α-1-antitrypsin deficiency is manifested by protease-induced bronchiectasis, lung injury, and liver damage including: cholestasis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and neutrophil cutaneous panniculitis.
PMC3235251	D02001	21-23 α-1-antitrypsin inhibits neutrophil elastase both in vitro and in vivo and has been successful in treating the pulmonary but not the liver manifestations of α-1-antirypsin deficiency, and adults with cystic fibrosis in a small clinical study.21-23 From our previous experience with immunoaffinity depletion (ID) of plasma for MS analysis it was not surprising to observe peptides arising from proteins that the ID column was directed against.
PMC3235251	D09000	Lastly, phosphatidylinositol-glycan specific phospholipase is an intracellular phospholipase responsible for the generation of second messengers from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) most notably inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4).42-44 Its significance in male plasma is entirely unknown but it appeared in all 5 plasma samples and was significantly increased in the plasma units from male versus female donors.
PMC3235251	D11005	In addition, the role of proteases in acute organ injury and multiple organ failure have been suggested, and if correct, female plasma could more efficiently be used as part of resuscitation to augment factor V levels, to increase circulating anti-protease concentrations, and to potentially decrease indiscriminant alternative pathway activation of complement.

PMC3235251	R00005	Therefore, transfusion of male plasma would appear to result in decreased levels of factor V and decreased anti-protease activity when compared to female plasma.

PMC3314906	A00000	Glutathione S-transferase P1 1 (GSTP1) belongs to the multigene isozyme family involved in cellular response to oxidative stress and apoptosis.
PMC3314906	D03002	Specifically, GSTP1 can act as an endogenous inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase by interaction with its C-terminal end.24 Additionally, GSTP1 expression rises in response to oxidative stress or proinflammatory stimuli.10 Dramatic elevations of reactive oxygen species are reported in HF by hypertrophy and proinflammatory stimuli, indicating multiple cellular responses, such as DNA synthesis, transcription factor activation, and gene and protein expression alteration, in HF.25 These reasons may also explain why GSTP1 was an overall better predictor of LV function in HF than proBNP, because inflammatory processes in HF (associated with GSTP1) are likely to involve the entire myocardium independently of LVMI and atrial dilation, processes that evidently affect proBNP production.

PMC3317910	A00001	Genome sequence analysis reveals a greatly expanded family of cercarial elastase gene isoforms in Schistosoma mansoni.
PMC3317910	A00002	This expansion appears to be unique to S. mansoni, and it is unknown whether gene duplication has led to divergent protease function.
PMC3317910	A01001	Computational modeling predicts key differences in the substrate-binding pockets of various cercarial elastase isoforms, suggesting a diversification of substrate preferences compared with the ancestral gene of the family.
PMC3317910	A03002	This process is facilitated by secreted proteases.
PMC3317910	A03004	Genomic analysis reveals a greatly expanded cercarial elastase gene family in S. mansoni.
PMC3317910	A03005	Despite sequence divergence, SmCE isoforms show similar expression profiles throughout the S. mansoni life cycle and have largely similar substrate specificities, suggesting that the majority of protease isoforms are functionally redundant and therefore their expansion is an example of gene dosage.
PMC3317910	D00004	In other parasite species, along with most eukaryotes, gene duplication frequently results in either an altered or novel gene function, and there are several examples of this that specifically involve protease gene families, including the duplication and functional divergence of the cathepsin L family in the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica, and that of several aspartic proteases in the nematode Strongyloides ratti[29], [30].
PMC3317910	D01000	The expansion of the cercarial elastase gene family by gene duplication in S. mansoni appears to involve both an increase in gene dosage for a critical enzyme during a crucial life cycle stage transition—host skin invasion–and may also represent the emergence of a new function of a serine protease as an invasive enzyme.
PMC3317910	D03000	The zoonotic S. japonicum, the avian-specific schistosome species and the more distantly related liver flukes are reported to use papain-like cysteine protease, rather than a serine protease, to facilitate initial invasion of their respective hosts [10], [11], [29].
PMC3317910	D03006	Further curation of the S. haematobium genome will allow for identification of additional full-length CE sequences, but the presence of both type CE1 and CE2b isoforms implies that amplification of the cercarial elastase gene family from the ancestral 2b gene is likely to have occurred prior to the divergence of the S. haematobium and S. mansoni lineages.

PMC3317910	I00006	These secretions contain multiple histolytic proteases [5], [6].
PMC3317910	I00007	In Schistosoma mansoni, the most of abundant of these is cercarial elastase (SmCE), an S1A serine protease named for its ability to digest insoluble elastin.
PMC3317910	I01004	Multiple CE isoforms exist in the related species Schistosoma haematobium, including homologs of SmCE1a, 1b, 2a and 2b isoform types [7], [8] The expansion of this family appears to be limited to the human-specific schistosomes: Schistosoma japonicum encodes only a single cercarial elastase gene, and there is substantial evidence that this species, along with the avian-specific schistosomes, utilizes another class of protease in host invasion [7], [9]–[12].
PMC3317910	I02000	The expansion of the cercarial elastase gene family in S. mansoni, and the sequence divergence among isoforms, suggests two alternative evolutionary scenarios: that gene duplication has allowed for differential regulation or diversified substrate specificity, in order to facilitate multiple functions in host invasion; or that SmCE gene duplication directly enhances fitness by simply increasing the amount of protease present.
PMC3317910	M01000	Cercarial elastase genes for S. mansoni, S. haematobium and S. japonicum were identified by searching all three annotated genomes in the SchistoDB website (http://beta.schistodb.net) using the Gene Ontology (GO)
PMC3317910	M07007	To definitively identify activity as due to the serine protease of cercariae, two chloromethyl ketone inhibitors were employed.
PMC3317910	M07008	The first is a known inhibitor of the protease, Z-AAPF-CMK (alyl-alyl-prolyl-phenyl-chloromethyl ketone), and the second is known not to inhibit the protease, Z-FPR-CMK (phenyl-prolyl-argyl-chloromethyl ketone)
PMC3317910	M07010	Sections were pre-incubated with inhibitors for one hour prior to initiation of the esterase reaction.
PMC3317910	R02001	SmCE is expressed as a zymogen and contains a short prodomain that must be removed in order for the protein to become active; moreover, SmSerpinQ, a serpin (serine protease inhibitor) with specificity against cercarial elastase provides additional post-translational regulation of protease activity [14], [20].
PMC3317910	R02006	In this way, only active protease (i.e., protease without a prodomain, or in complex with inhibitor) is biotinylated.
PMC3317910	R03003	Treatment with a general serine esterase stain led to distinct visual staining in both the acetabular cell bodies and the ducts leading from acetabular cells to the anterior end of developing larvae (Figure 2B).
PMC3317910	R03005	Pre-treatment with Z-AAPF-CMK, a known inhibitor of SmCE, abolished stain reactivity (Figure 1C), whereas treatment with Z-FPR-CMK, to which the SmCE is largely insensitive, had no effect on esterase staining (Figure 1D)
PMC3317910	R04004	While SmCE is predicted to have the basic α/ß fold common to all chymotrypsin-like serine proteases, there are several notable structural features that are largely unique to SmCE, as has been previously noted [22].
PMC3317910	R04006	In this regard SmCE resembles the structure of rat mast cell protease II
PMC3317910	R05001	In protease nomenclature, the position where the amino acid N-terminal to the scissile bond of the substrate binds the active site of the protease is referred to as the S1 pocket, and the next site is the S2, etc.

PMC3346765	R07004	Receptor tyrosine kinases have been suggested as drug targets in cancer therapy but cancer cells tend to develop resistance to these therapeutics.
PMC3346765	R07006	A recent study pointed out that inhibiting N-linked glycosylation reduces receptor tyrosine kinase signaling and radiosensitizes tumor cells [45].
PMC3346765	R10001	Major clusters include the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) cluster (42 proteins), the kinase (EGF receptor subfamily) cluster (27 proteins), the HLA class I histocompatibility antigen type proteins (17 proteins) and proteases (13 proteins) (see Table S5).
PMC3346765	R12000	The kinase (EGF receptor subfamily) cluster is over-represented for the tyrosine kinases (expected 6, observed 21) including receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-4 (ERBB4), fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) and tyrosine-protein kinase Tec (TEC).
PMC3346765	R12002	17 of the 21 tyrosine kinases in our list are annotated as receptors with a ligand-binding extracellular domain and a catalytic intracellular kinase domain.
PMC3346765	R14000	Serine proteases represent another set of proteins with over-represented NXS/T variants (expected 7, observed 13).
PMC3346765	R14001	N-glycosylation of the proteases and their substrates plays an important role in protease activity.
PMC3346765	R14002	The serine proteases participate in the processes of blood coagulation, apoptosis and inflammation [54].
PMC3346765	R14004	Overall the protein families that are over-represented in our dataset based on cluster analysis show that protein involved in immunity, blood coagulation and kinase activity are the major types that undergo changes in glycosylation.
PMC3346765	R14005	A survey of nsSNV in these proteins reveals that there is an abundance of nsSNVs in the blood coagulation pathway proteins and serine proteases (number of amino acids in the human proteome 11293923, total nsSNVs 494983; number of nsSNVs inside data set 1959, expected 1335, p-value 0.05).
PMC3346765	R14006	The difference between the expected and observed is less for HLA class I histocompatibility antigens and related proteins with the MHC domain (number of nsSNVs inside data set 1952, expected 2070, p-value 0.40) and for the kinases with the protein tyrosine kinase domain (number of nsSNVs inside data set 5670, expected 4749, p-value 0.09).
PMC3346765	R18001	Based on our functional analysis using IPA, we had observed that cathepsin D, an acid protease, is in the list of top cellular, molecular functions and diseases such as metabolic, genetic and developmental disorders and has a structure available with a carbohydrate attached at the variant glycosylation sequon.
PMC3349588	A01004	However, there were four glycolytic enzymes and two targets of matrix metalloproteinase released significantly from the heart when ischemic time was increasing.
PMC3349588	A01005	These proteins were L-lactate dehydrogenase B(LDHB), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase), phosphoglycerate mutase 2 (PGAM2), gelsolin and isoform 8 of titin.
PMC3349588	A01009	Protein to protein interaction network analysis showed glycolytic enzymes, such as isoform alpha-enolase of alpha-enolase, isoform 1 of triosephosphate isomerase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, had more connections than other proteins in myocardial metabolism during ischemia.

PMC3349588	I00002	Reasonably specific markers for blood tests including creatine kinase muscle/brain isoform (CK-MB), cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) are released after the onset of significant necrosis instead of early ischemia, and they all require a level of myocardial necrosis to prompt their release from myocytes before they can be detected.
PMC3349588	R02000	With exception of cardiac troponin I and T, many known clinic markers for myocardial ischemia and several potential new biomarkers were detected in our study, such as aspartate aminotransferase (ASA), CK-MB, heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), and myohemoglobin (MB) (Table ​(Table2).2).
PMC3349588	R02003	In addition, five additional proteins specific to heart or muscle were identified: cardiac alpha actin, isoform alpha-enolase of alpha-enolase (ENO1), phosphoglycerate mutase 2 (PGAM2), isoform M1 of pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2(PKM2) and isoform 8 of Titin.
PMC3349588	R02005	Four proteins expressed abundantly in heart were identified including Cysteine-rich protein 2,S100 calcium binding protein A1, 14 kDa phosphohistidine phosphatase and mesenchymal stem cell protein DSC92.
PMC3349588	R02006	In additional, those identified proteins including Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase), Creatine kinase M-type (CKM), Malate dehydrogenase (MDH1), Creatine kinase B-type (CKB), (heart-type)Fatty acid-binding protein (FABP3), Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [NAD+](GPD1), PGAM2, MB, Superoxide dismutase(SOD1),

PMC3349588	R03004	The quantitative results showed that there were six proteins released from the heart when ischemic time was increasing, including LDHB, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (GPI), PGAM2, gelsolin and isoform 8 of titin (Figure ​(Figure5).5).
PMC3349588	R03005	Four of these six proteins are glycolytic enzymes, including LDHB, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, PGAM2, and two of them (gelsolin and isoform 8 of titin) are targets of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), which will be activated during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury
PMC3349588	R07008	Thus, many glycolytic enzymes will be expressed and could be released from myocardial cells during early ischemia, such as L-LDH, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and PGAM2.

PMC3358667	I02004	Enzymes belonging to the second group are called endopeptidases and they tend to cleave away from the end of the peptide.
PMC3358667	I05000	The current approach significantly extends the exopeptidase activity model presented in [5].
PMC3358667	I05003	On the other hand taking the splitting reaction (coming from endopeptidase cleavage A → B + C) into account significantly complicates the mathematical description.
PMC3358667	I06003	Finally, identified active peptidases for both groups of healthy donors and colorectal cancer patients are presented.
PMC3358667	I08001	Hence each event node is labelled by a peptidase, and has one ingoing edge and two outgoing edges (leading to peptide prefix and suffix obtained by cutting the substrate at a single site).
PMC3358667	I09003	We also add the source and the sink in the graph modeling the creation of precursor peptides (e.g. caused by the activity of some endopeptidases, which is not captured by our model) and complete degradation of short peptides.

PMC3358667	M03001	Exemplary frequency matrices for elastase and trypsin enzymes are presented in Figure ​Figure22.
PMC3358667	M04001	Then for any peptidase p ∈ 𝒫 we detect the cleavage event cutting given peptide sequence if it matches the consensus sequence well.
PMC3358667	M05000	Let us consider cleavage v†w made by peptidase p ∈ 𝒫. Assume, that the cleavage point is surrounded by the sequence of amino acids (possibly with some empty positions at the ends) aPk...aP1aP1′...aPl′ where 1 ≤ k, l ≤ 4.
PMC3358667	M09002	We are mainly interested in estimation of the parameters (λp)p∈𝒫 which describes activities of peptidases.
PMC3358667	R07000	The set of identified enzymes do not vary significantly between all investigated samples: there are 6 peptidases identified in all samples and 19 peptidases found in at least one sample (listed in Figure ​Figure6).6).

PMC3382506	A00001	The O-glycoproteome is differentially regulated in cells by dynamic expression of a subset of 20 polypeptide GalNAc-transferases (GalNAc-Ts), and methods to identify important functions of individual GalNAc-Ts are largely unavailable.
PMC3382506	A00005	We confirm that GalNAc-T2–directed site-specific O-glycosylation inhibits proprotein activation of the lipase inhibitor ANGPTL3 in HepG2 cells and further identify eight O-glycoproteins exclusively glycosylated by T2 of which one, ApoC-III, is implicated in dyslipidemia.
PMC3382506	D00002	It is our hypothesis that differential regulation of the expression of GalNAc-Ts in cells provides for a variable and dynamic O-glycoproteome, which has specific biological impact for protein functions such as serving as coregulator of proprotein convertase processing (20).
PMC3382506	D00008	The zinc finger nuclease gene targeting strategy presented here should be widely applicable to all GalNAc-Ts, and it provides a major leap in our understanding of site-specific functions of O-glycosylation.
PMC3382506	D02001	Although these studies are intriguing, they mainly rely on RNA silencing strategies, which have inherent problems with glycosyltransferases, where complete and specific knockout is required.

PMC3497446	A00007	C. jejuni OMVs possess cytotoxic activity and induce a host immune response from T84 intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), which was not reduced by OMV pretreatment with proteinase K or polymyxin B prior to coincubation with IECs.
PMC3497446	D02001	The virulence-associated proteins identified included all three components of CDT (CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC), the fibronectin binding proteins CadF and FlpA, and the HtrA and Cj0511 proteases, as well as 16 N-linked glycoproteins, including the major antigenic protein Peb3.
PMC3497446	D03002	In this study, C. jejuni 11168H OMVs were shown to be cytotoxic to Caco-2 cells after a 24-h exposure, as measured by the presence of extracellular lactate dehydrogenase, suggesting a role for other cytotoxic C. jejuni factors in addition to CDT, such as bacterial exotoxic proteases that can damage extracellular structures, as the primary effect of CDT is eukaryotic cell cycle arrest at the G2/M stage, which results in a cessation of cell division rather than cell lysis (49).
PMC3497446	D03003	The two serine proteases identified as associated with C. jejuni 11168H OMVs by proteomic analysis were HtrA (4, 9) and Cj0511.
PMC3497446	D04008	The observation that OMVs pretreated with proteinase K show no reduction in the ability to induce both IL-8 and hBD-3 indicates that the C. jejuni virulence factors involved in the induction of these host responses are intravesicular components of OMVs, since proteinase K will degrade proteins externally associated with OMVs but not those within the lumen of the OMVs (10).
PMC3497446	D05005	The identification of the fibronectin binding proteins CadF (44) and FlpA (45) as well as the major antigenic protein Peb3 (61) and the serine protease HtrA (4) associated with C. jejuni OMVs would indicate further possible mechanisms for the adherence of OMVs to human IECs, which could lead to internalization of OMVs by receptor-mediated endocytosis.
PMC3497446	I02000	Rather than secrete virulence factors into the surrounding milieu, where they could be degraded by host proteases, many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens utilize outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as a mechanism of delivering active proteins and other moieties into host cells (19).
PMC3497446	I03006	For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa OMVs have been shown to deliver multiple virulence factors, including β-lactamase, alkaline phosphatase, hemolytic phospholipase C, and the Cif toxin, directly into airway epithelial cells (10).

PMC3578717	I01013	Therefore, these biochemical tests sometimes lack specificity because they cannot differentiate between the alpha-amylase 1 (present in saliva) and alpha-amylase 2 (present in semen and vaginal secretion)

PMC3582525	D06002	Conversely, the down-regulation of GST and GTPase Ran might be due to the HCV infection.

PMC3582525	R05005	The co-infection of HIV-1/HCV led to the down-regulation of cytoskeletal protein tropomyosin alpha-4 isoform 1 (spot 1), the glycolytic protein pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 (spot 5), an ER ATPase (spot 7), the anti-apoptosis and apoptosis regulator enzyme GST (spot 8), EIF3K (spot 9–2.57-fold), the cell growth protein GTPase Ran (spot 10), the chaperone HSP90-beta (spot 11–2.77-fold), and the stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP-1) (spot 13–2.82-fold).

PMC3631612	D05000	Similarly, the comparative proteomic analysis using 2D-DIGE analysis showed for the first time that the human pre-nodal lymph is characterized by an enriched set of proteins such as: alpha-1-antitrypsin, annexin A1, alpha-tubulin, cystatin A, BAI-1 associated protein 2, calmodulin-like protein, caspase 14, C-type lectin domain family 3, desmoglein-1, fatty acid binding protein, gelsolin, glutathione S-transferase, pepsin-like aspartate protease, S-100 A9 Ca2+ binding protein, and vitamin D binding protein.

PMC3654532	D01004	Interestingly, several differentially expressed proteins identified in this model system were also detected in the current serum proteomic study, including fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A, apolipoproteins A-I and E, and multiple proteins involved in acute phase and inflammatory responses.
PMC3654532	D02001	For example, fumarylacetoacetase, an enzyme predominantly expressed in the liver that is essential for tyrosine metabolism, was significantly elevated in DILI patients compared with controls, correlated with ALT, AST and alkaline phosphatase, and was also identified as the only priority 1 protein with significantly higher expression in patients with hepatocellular vs. mixed pattern of injury.
PMC3654532	D02002	Type I tyrosinaemia, a genetic disorder characterised by fumarylacetoacetase deficiency and systemic accumulation of tyrosine, is strongly associated with liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma.40 Indeed, the significant upregulation of fumarylacetoacetase expression in patients with hepatocellular DILI suggests a compensatory mechanism in response to accumulation of tyrosine and/or other toxic metabolites, including fumarylacetoacetate, induced by hepatotoxic agents.
PMC3654532	D02003	Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B, a hepatic enzyme involved in glucose and fructose metabolism, was significantly greater in patients with DILI compared with controls and in patients with hepatocellular DILI vs. cholestatic DILI, and was identified as an independent correlate of both serum ALT and AST elevations.
PMC3654532	D02005	These associations may provide an explanation for the previously demonstrated detection of serum autoantibodies to fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B in patients with troglitazone-induced hepatotoxicity41 and support the concept that expression levels of this enzyme may correlate with extent of liver injury.

PMC3708178	A00005	Unexpectedly, this proteinase was immunodetected by the serum of male trichomoniasis patients but not by the female patient serum or sera from healthy men and women.
PMC3708178	D00001	Because iron plays a critical role in host-parasite relationships and in the general physiology of the parasite (26) in the female microenvironment, modulating several pathogenic properties, such as adhesin synthesis (27), protease expression (28), and the expression of crucial metabolic enzymes (26), it seems plausible to infer that in the male microenvironment, Zn2+ might has a crucial role as well.
PMC3708178	D04002	In contrast, six isoforms of actin, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, putative lactate dehydrogenase, and putative adenosine triphosphatase were up-regulated (26).
PMC3708178	D05000	Interestingly, putative cysteine and metallopeptidases were identified as immunogenic molecules.
PMC3708178	D05002	T. vaginalis expresses several proteinases that participate in many parasitic functions such as trichomonal adherence (31–33), cytotoxicity (17–18, 25, 33), host colonization, hemolysis (34), immune evasion (35–36), signal transduction, nutrient acquisition (34, 37), complement resistant and apoptosis induction (38–39).
PMC3708178	D05003	Moreover, papain-like cysteine proteinases have been described as virulence factors in this parasite (17, 32, 40).
PMC3708178	D06002	Unexpectedly, this metallopeptidase was immunorecognized by the male trichomoniasis patient serum but not by the female patient serum.
PMC3708178	D07001	This is not the first protease discovered that is up-regulated by the presence of certain cations from the host.
PMC3708178	D08001	However, until now, only four metalloproteinases from T. vaginalis had been reported (16, 42).
PMC3708178	D08003	Another reported metalloproteinase is a 47-kDa peptidase from the trichomonad hydrogenosome, the hydrogenosomal processing peptidase (HPP).

PMC3708178	D08006	The fourth metallopeptidase reported is a 50-kDa proteinase that was up-regulated in the presence of Zn2+ in a female T. vaginalis isolate (16).
PMC3708178	D08008	Interestingly, we found a 50-kDa-proteolytic activity band in the HGMN01 and CNCD147 T. vaginalis isolates that might correspond to the previously reported metallopeptidase (16).
PMC3708178	D08010	TvMP50 was inhibited by EDTA but not by cysteine or serine proteinase inhibitors such as TLCK, E-64, leupeptin, or PMSF.
PMC3708178	D08012	Bozner and Demes activated the proteinases at pH 8.2 (42), whereas we activated them at pH 7.5 because at the basic pH of 8.2, the activity of TvMP50 was not observed.
PMC3708178	D08013	A pH of 7.5 has previously been reported for the activation of metallopeptidases (24).
PMC3708178	D09000	Peptidases with at least two metal ions in the active site are a structurally heterogeneous group.
PMC3708178	D09002	Clan MG metallopeptidases, such as the methionine aminopeptidases, have the pita-bread fold and contain two cobalt or two manganese ions in their active centers (44).To identify the residues involved in catalysis, the TvMP50 sequence was aligned with other members of the peptidase clan MG, including aminopeptidase P (Ec_MER001244) and Xaa-Pro dipeptidase (Ec_MER001250) from Escherichia coli.
PMC3708178	D09004	These results suggest that TvMP50 has an active-site configuration similar to other members of the peptidase clan MG.
PMC3708178	D09005	According to the alignment analyses, TvMP50 might be classified as an aminopeptidase of the clan MG.
PMC3708178	D10000	According to the crystal structures of E. coli methionyl aminopeptidase and aminopeptidase P (APP) (45–46), TvMP50 might have diverse metal requirements.

PMC3708178	D13003	Previously, it had been reported as a T. vaginalis enolase family protein (including putative enolase 3 and enolase 4) (58); however, enolase 2 was not included.
PMC3708178	D13004	Although enolase 2 is down-regulated by Zn2+, this molecule was immunorecognized by the male trichomoniasis patient serum in the present study.
PMC3708178	D13005	Furthermore, Whiting and colleagues reported that 15 of 22 patients with proven Streptococcus pneumoniae infection have antibodies to α-enolase, suggesting its important role in natural immunity to S. pneumonia (59).
PMC3708178	D17000	The energy metabolism of parasites may include the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase, such as Entamoeba histolytica in which the pyruvate, the end-product of carbohydrate catabolism by glycolysis, is oxidatively decarboxylated by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase) (65), transferring the electrons produced during pyruvate oxidation to ferredoxin, whereas acetyl-CoA is consecutively reduced to acetaldehyde and ethanol (under microaerophilic conditions), mainly via the activity of a bifunctional NADH-dependent aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase (EhADH2) or to ethanol and acetate (under aerobic conditions) via the latter and acetyl-CoA synthetase (ADP-forming) (65–68).
PMC3708178	D17007	Drug-resistant T. foetus also increases activity of the cytosolic NADP-dependent malic enzyme to enhance the pyruvate producing bypass and provide the NADPH required by alcohol dehydrogenase (71).

PMC3708178	D17009	Because the alcohol acetaldehyde dehydrogenase from Listeria monocytogenes (LAP) is a pathogenic factor, promoting bacterial adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells by interacting with mammalian receptor Hsp60 (72–75), it could be possible that this type of enzymes might induce a host immune response.

PMC3772042	D00001	These features are largely executed through well characterized virulence factors such as cysteine proteases (gingipains), fimbriae, lipopolysaccharide, capsule, and hemagglutinins that exert their effects through direct interactions with the host [49,55].
PMC3772042	D00004	[56] and the GppX two-component sensor kinase system, which regulate the production or processing of gingipains and/or fimbriae [10,12].
PMC3772042	D03000	It has been proposed that secretion or shedding of microbial proteinases within the autophagosome is one mechanism by which P. gingivalis subverts the autophagic response [27].
PMC3772042	D03001	This theory is based on evidence of increased proteolysis of long-lived endogenous proteins of HCAEC infected with P. gingivalis, and microscopic evidence of P. gingivalis shedding secretory vesicles presumed to be rich in proteinases while the bacterium is residing within late autophagosomes [57].
PMC3772042	D05008	Madrigal et al. have recently demonstrated that Kgp gingipain disrupts intracellular kinases that act as downstream effectors of Toll-like receptor (TLR), TNF-α, and Nod-like receptor (NLR) mediated production of cytokines [61].
PMC3772042	D07003	Other noteworthy changes within the proteome profile were the decrease in ATP-dependent Clp protease and peptidylarginine deiminase in the protein fraction of W83Δ717.

PMC3772042	I04010	Quantitative proteome profiling of W83Δ717 also revealed decreased protein levels of other putative virulence factors including peptidylarginine deiminase and Clp protease.
PMC3772042	R13005	Other proteins that were decreased in W83Δ717 include Clp protease, which is implicated in facilitating evasion of the endosome/lysosome pathway [52], and peptidylarginine deiminase, which may enhance colonization and virulence of P. gingivalis by inactivating antimicrobial peptides [53,54].
PMC3780806	A00000	The progression of many solid tumors is characterized by the release of tumor-associated proteases and the detection of tumor specific proteolytic activity in serum specimens is a promising diagnostic tool in oncology.

PMC3780806	A01000	A reporter peptide (RP) with the amino acid sequence WKPYDAAD was synthesized that has a known cleavage site for the cysteine-endopeptidase cancer procoagulant (EC 3.4.22.26).
PMC3780806	D00001	Tumor-associated proteases like matrix metalloproteases, cathepsins, kallikrein related peptidases and members of the plasminogen activator system are secreted into the bloodstream and might be candidates for functional protease profiling (for review see [20]).
PMC3780806	D00002	Specifically, the tumor-associated protease cancer procoagulant is secreted from numerous malignancies including colorectal cancer into the bloodstream [21].
PMC3780806	D01008	This demonstrates that the cleavage of CP-RP and the accumulation of CP-AP is a specific reaction that is related to cysteinprotease activity.

PMC3780806	D03013	To achieve this goal, it will be necessary to systematically identify reporter peptide sequences that are most efficiently cleaved by disease-specific proteases.
PMC3780806	D03015	Further work will focus on the identification of additional reporter peptides that are cleaved by other tumor-associated proteases e.g. metalloproteases, cathepsins or kallikreins in order to construct a multiplex protease profiling assay with increased diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.

PMC3780806	I00002	Furthermore, there is increasing evidence that proteases also have key functions in early stages of tumor development [4].
PMC3780806	I00003	The tumor-associated proteases are either secreted directly by the tumor or originate from surrounding connective tissue and infiltrating leucocytes as a result of tumor-stroma interaction [5].
PMC3780806	I00004	Some tumor-associated proteases like cathepsins, matrix-metalloproteases, kallikreins and cancer procoagulant (CP) are released into the bloodstream and can be used for diagnostic and prognostic purposes [6-10].
PMC3780806	I02001	To protect the reporter peptide from unwanted and unspecific processing by exopeptidases the cleavage site WKPYDAAD is flanked by aminohexanoic acid (see Table ​Table1).1).
PMC3780806	I02002	When the reporter peptide is cleaved by the endoprotease cancer procoagulant after the tyrosine (Y) [15], the resulting free amino-terminus of the intermediate fragment is rapidly trimmed down by aminopeptidases [8].
PMC3780806	I03004	This indicates the presence of the tumor-associated protease cancer procoagulant that is associated with an increased cleavage of the reporter peptide in serum specimens of tumor patients.
PMC3780806	R00001	The amino acid sequence WKPYDAAD of CP-RP is specifically cleaved after the aminoacid tyrosine (Y) by the endoprotease cancer procoagulant prior to further processing by serum exopeptidases [8,15].
PMC3780806	R02000	The cysteine-endoprotease cancer procoagulant can specifically be inhibited by iodoacetamide

PMC3862442	R04007	Some of these still had highly significant Blastp E-values to a human protein, e.g. the P. falciparum kinases listed in Table 2, since a short region of high similarity in two otherwise disparate proteins can return a high local alignment score (in the case of the P. falciparum kinases, this region is the catalytic domain).
PMC3862442	R06005	The orthologues of the kinases PF13_0166 and CDPK7 (PF11_0242) have been suggested to be essential in P. berghei (Tewari et al., 2010).
PMC3862442	R06006	In T. gondii, the orthologue of the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (PF13_0176) has been shown to essential by conditional knockout (Onyango et al., 2011) and GAP40 (PFE0785c) is part of the essential glideosome complex, though the protein itself has not been verified as essential (Frenal et al., 2010).
PMC3862442	R08003	One of these, dihydropteroate synthetase (DHPS; PF08_0095) is one of the very few validated targets of clinically used antimalarials, consistent with the value of our approach for identifying essential targets.
PMC3862442	R08007	For the kinases in the list a slightly modified approach was taken, as many kinase inhibitors are well known to be cross reactive against multiple kinases.
PMC3862442	R08008	An empirical cut-off of 30% local sequence identity in the kinase domains was therefore used to identify homologues for potential inhibitors of from the TDR/ChEMBL data (Table 3).
PMC3862442	R10002	These could be differences in sequence, as is the case with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Satchell et al., 2005) or in regulation, as demonstrated for dihydrofolate reductase (Zhang and Rathod, 2002).
PMC3862442	R10008	We are confident that this set contains promising leads because it includes known targets such as dihydropteroate synthetase (PF08_0095), the target of sulfonamides (dihydrofolate synthetase is not included because it is 20% identical to human mitochondrial tetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate synthase, EC 6.3.2.17), and enzymes of the non-mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid synthesis.
PMC3862442	R10009	Another potential target in the apicoplast could be stromal processing peptidase (PF14_0382), which has already been characterized in P. falciparum (van Dooren et al., 2002).
PMC3862442	R10010	Investigational targets identified include glutamate dehydrogenase C (PF08_0132) (Aparicio et al., 2010; Storm et al., 2011) and Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (PF11_0239, PF11_0242) (Kato et al., 2008; Ojo et al., 2010; Lim et al., 2012).
PMC3862442	R10011	In addition, there are enzymes which are being targeted in other systems, e.g. apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (PF13_0176) (Tell et al., 2010) or telomerase reverse transcriptase (PF13_0080) (Chen et al., 2009) by antitumor agents, or phosphomannose isomerase (MAL8P1.156) by antifungals.
PMC3862442	R10013	A surprising find in the list of candidate targets was phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PF14_0246), the enzyme responsible for carbon fixation in C4 plants.
PMC3862442	R10015	If this process is essential, PEP carboxylase could be an attractive target since inhibitors have been identified as C4 plant herbicides (Madhusudana et al., 1980; Jenkins, 1989;

PMC3905668	A00005	In our present study, we identified this kinase using a proteomic approach and further delineate its role in HIV-1 replication.
PMC3905668	A01000	A proteomic approach was designed to systematically identify human protein kinases that potently interact with HIV-1 Gag and successfully identified 22 candidates.
PMC3905668	A01001	Among this panel, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) was found to phosphorylate HIV-1
PMC3905668	A02000	Our current results indicate for the first time that HIV-1 Gag phosphorylation on Ser487 is mediated by aPKC and that this kinase may regulate the incorporation of Vpr into HIV-1 virions and thereby supports virus infectivity.
PMC3905668	D01008	In contrast, our present approach is distinct from these earlier studies as we initially attempted to identify the kinases responsible for Gag-p6 phosphorylation and then explore their role in HIV-1 replication.

PMC3905668	I01002	Concomitant with, or after these viral particles pinch off and are released from the host cell via budding, the virus-encoded protease becomes activated and cleaves Gag into its functional subdomains, matrix (MA, p17), capsid (CA, p24), and nucleocapsid (NC, p7), as well as several shorter segments: SP1 (spacer peptide 1), SP2, and p6.
PMC3905668	I05000	In our current study, we utilized an in vitro high-throughput protein-protein interaction assay using full-length HIV-1 Gag and host protein kinases synthesized by the wheat germ cell-free protein production system in an attempt to identify the kinase (s) that directs the phosphorylation of Gag p6 to promote virus replication.
PMC3905668	I05001	We here report that atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is a functional interactor of HIV-1 Gag and facilitates viral infectivity by promoting the incorporation of Vpr into virions.
PMC3905668	M04000	A total of 287 cDNAs encoding human protein kinases were constructed as described previously [23].
PMC3905668	M05002	For each protein kinase, 1 μl of crude recombinant biotinylated construct from the human kinase library was incubated with 1 μl of crude GST-Gag or GST-DHFR in 10 μl of kinase assay buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl pH8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween20, 0.1% BSA) at 37°C for 1 h in one well of a 384-well Optiplate (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA.
PMC3905668	M14001	In experiments using kinase inhibitors, cells were treated with each inhibitor at 12 h before virus infection.
PMC3905668	R00002	We synthesized more than 287 full-length protein kinases using a wheat germ cell-free protein production system, and screened them for their association with Gag with the amplified luminescent proximity homogenous assay (AlphaScreen)
PMC3905668	R00005	Full-length Gag and human protein kinases were synthesized using a wheat germ cell-free system and subjected to an AlphaScreen assessment.
PMC3905668	R00006	The binding efficiency of HIV-1 Gag with each kinase was normalized relative to the luminescent activity of a control DHFR protein (Figure 1B).
PMC3905668	R00007	When a relative light unit per cutoff (RLU/Co) ratio of ≥ 3.0 was used as the threshold, we found that 22 host kinases could selectively interact with HIV-1 Gag and thus were identified as primary kinase candidates for the phosphorylation of HIV-1 Gag (Figure 1B).
PMC3905668	R01002	Interestingly, we further found that the aPKC family kinases, PKCζ and PKCι, could interact with HIV-1 Gag at a relatively high score (S/N = 3.57 and 3.19, respectively).
PMC3905668	R03002	Recombinant GST-Gag or GST proteins were expressed and purified from wheat germ cell-free extract by glutathione sepharose beads and used as substrates for in vitro kinase assays.
PMC3905668	R05001	Subsequent in vitro kinase assay results demonstrated that GST-p6 is phosphorylated by aPKC, but not GST-p6-S487A
PMC3905668	R06004	293T cells were transfected with V5 tagged wild type aPKC or a kinase-negative mutant (aPKC-Kn), together with wild type Gag-Pol.
PMC3905668	R07008	We thus also investigated using specific inhibitors whether these kinases could mediate the phosphorylation of HIV-1 Gag at Ser487.
PMC3905668	R11000	To further explore the relevance of Gag phosphorylation to HIV-1 replication, we examined whether aPKC kinase activity is necessary to regulate Vpr incorporation into HIV-1 virions.
PMC3905668	R11001	Gag phosphorylation at Ser487 was prominently enhanced by wild type aPKC but not kinase negative mutant aPKC (Kn) (Figure 5D).

PMC3959865	I01001	This is especially important because lung cancer patients with activating mutations in EGFR demonstrate dramatic sensitivity to EGFR targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (8, 9), such as gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa, AstraZeneca) and erlotinib (OSI-774, Tarceva, Genentech) (10, 11).
PMC3959865	I01002	These compounds inhibit the downstream activity of the EGFR axis by competitively inhibiting ATP binding in the catalytic core of the kinase domain of EGFR.
PMC3959865	I02000	To bridge this gap, we first assessed the broad protein network effects of inhibiting EGFR kinase with gefitinib in an epidermoid cancer cell line (A431) that over-expresses EGFR.
PMC3959865	R00004	The dose of 100 nM gefitinib inhibits EGFR phosphorylation (IC50 40 – 80 nM) while minimizing suppression of other kinases (for example, the IC50 for HER2 is 1,200 – 3,700 nM) (29).
PMC3959865	R04001	A431 cells were treated with either an AKT pathway specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (LY294002) or a MAPK-specific TKI (PD98059).
PMC3959865	R05002	Gefitinib inhibits the phosphorylation of EGFR in HCC827, H1650, and H23 cell lines and is ineffective in H1975 cells as a result of the T790M mutation in EGFR kinase (31).
PMC3959865	R07000	To test the hypothesis that some of these proteins may distinguish the response phenotype of tumors to EGFR kinase inhibitors in vivo, we compare the basal levels and response to therapy of the markers in an in vivo derived xenograft model resistant to gefitinib (A431-ZDR).

PMC3972748	R04000	In AMS, three proteins most prominently known for their ability to modify redox status [i.e., peroxiredoxin-6 (Prdx-6), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1)] increased approximately twofold after 9 h of hypobaric hypoxia compared with measurements made before ascent (Table 1).
PMC3972748	R04003	With respect to GPx, our findings are supported by a report that hypoxic exposure (4 wk, 4,560 m) raises glutathione peroxidase activity in individuals from sea level (48).
PMC3972748	R05000	Peroxiredoxins and glutathione peroxidase protect against cellular oxidative stress and, through their regulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels, modulate redox-sensitive signaling cascades (19, 22, 54).
PMC3972748	R05001	Prdx-6 is an oxidant-sensitive enzyme (13) and is distinguished from other members of the peroxiredoxin family, in part, by its dual peroxidase (i.e., oxidizes sn-2 fatty acyl group of phospholipids) and phospholipase A2 (PLA2) activity [i.e., hydrolyzes the sn-2 ester (alkyl) bond of phospholipids] (12, 18).
PMC3972748	R05002	QSOX1 is a protein belonging to a family of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-dependent sulfhydryl oxidases that catalyze the oxidation of thiols to disulfides by reducing oxygen to H2O2.
PMC3972748	R06007	Correspondingly, the lack of change in Prdx-6 and glutathione peroxidase with hypobaric hypoxia in AMS·R may reflect comparatively reduced, but not absent, hypoxia-induced oxidant production relative to AMS.
PMC3972748	R09003	It was recently proposed that the effect of redox status to modulate HIF1α activity is dependent, in part, on the duration of oxidant exposure such that ROS (H2O2) induce HIF1α in the short term but repress HIF1α activity and the expression of prolylhydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) after prolonged exposure (38).

PMC4003525	A00002	Using biochemical and proteomic approaches to identify MLC1 interactors and elucidate MLC1 function we found that MLC1 interacts with the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), the proton pump that regulates endosomal acidity.
PMC4003525	A00003	Because we previously showed that in intracellular organelles MLC1 directly binds Na, K-ATPase, which controls endosomal pH, we studied MLC1 endosomal localization and trafficking and MLC1 effects on endosomal acidity and function using human astrocytoma cells overexpressing wild-type (WT) MLC1 or MLC1 carrying pathological mutations.
PMC4003525	D03005	A similar behavior has been described for the Na, K-ATPase which exerts an essential role in the maintenance of the slightly acidic pH typical of early endosomes in which it is localized (Cain and Murphy, 1988; Cain et al., 1989; Feldmann et al., 2007; Grabe and Oster, 2001) and whose direct interaction with MLC1 has been demonstrated by our group (Brignone et al., 2011).

PMC4003525	I03000	In initial experiments aimed at identifying MLC1 protein interactors and MLC1-associated functional pathways, we found that MLC1 interacts with the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), the proton pump responsible for endosomal acidification (Forgac, 2007).
PMC4003525	I03001	This finding and the observation that in rat primary astrocytes and human astrocytoma cells MLC1 binds the Na, K-ATPase which, among other functions, controls early endosomal pH (Brignone et al., 2011; Lanciotti et al., 2012), prompted us to investigate the possible role of MLC1 in organelle acidification and protein trafficking and the effects of MLC disease-associated pathological mutations on these pathways.
PMC4003525	R00001	Among the potential MLC1 interactors identified (manuscript in preparation), we found that 2 subunits (a1 and B2) of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), the proton pump responsible for endosomal acidification (Forgac, 2007), were pulled-down by His-MLC1 in 2 out of 3 experiments (Table 1).
PMC4003525	R00003	Because Na, K-ATPase, besides controlling plasma-membrane potential and cell volume, is also involved in the regulation of endosomal pH (Fuchs et al., 1989), these findings suggested that MLC1 might play a role in this process.
PMC4003525	R10000	MLC1 interaction with proteins involved in the regulation of organelle acidification, like V-ATPase and Na, K-ATPase, and the high levels of expression of MLC1 in early and recycling endosomal compartments support the idea of a possible involvement of MLC1 in endosomal function and modulation of organelle acidity.

PMC4119355	A00003	Based on concordance in statistical significance and confirmatory results obtained from analysis of both serum and plasma, we identified eleven proteins associated with muscular dystrophy, among which four proteins were elevated in blood from muscular dystrophy patients: carbonic anhydrase III (CA3) and myosin light chain 3 (MYL3), both specifically expressed in slow-twitch muscle fibers and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) and electron transfer flavoprotein A (ETFA).
PMC4119355	D02003	This allows not only for detection of proteins expected to be in plasma, such as CA3 with an average concentration of approximately 10 ng/ml (Mokuno et al, 1985; Ohta et al, 1991) or creatine kinase with a reference limit around 3–5 ng/ml (Apple et al, 2003), but presumably also for analysis of leakage products (Anderson & Anderson, 2002) from the muscle tissue.
PMC4119355	D03007	In comparison with these proteins, levels of creatine kinase, which has been used for confirmation of diagnosis of muscle wasting diseases for several decades (Mendell et al, 2012), were also found to be increased in patients, but with less degree of concordance and statistical significance, yet still supporting the technical validity of our approach.
PMC4119355	D05003	Interestingly, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have shown to have positive effects in animal models of dystrophinopathies, suggesting they might be potentially explored for human therapy (Giacomotto et al, 2009).
PMC4119355	D05010	Studies in healthy individuals showed that CA3 is accumulated into the blood as a consequence of skeletal muscle injury (Väänänen et al, 1990; Brancaccio et al, 2010) and vigorous physical exercise (Takala et al, 1989) in a similar way as creatine kinase.
PMC4119355	D06001	In contrast, ETFB, interacting with ETFA to build a complex involved in electron transfer from mitochondrial flavin-containing dehydrogenases to the respiratory chain, showed an opposite trend.
PMC4119355	D07000	Abundance of three serum proteins MMP9, metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1), and fibronectin (FN1) has very recently been shown to correlate with disease progression in patients affected by muscle dystrophy (Brancaccio et al, 2010; Nadarajah et al, 2011; Martin et al, 2014).
PMC4119355	D07001	In addition, potential protein markers for treatment outcome were identified in mdx mice plasma, for example, the coagulation Factor XIIIa (FXIIIa), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIFr), glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), apolipoprotein E α (ApoE α), and β actins (ApoE β) (Alagaratnam et al, 2008;

PMC4119355	R04001	These two proteins together with creatine kinase, MDH2, and ETFA were main contributors for separating NMD patients and healthy controls in the UNIFE cohort (Fig ​(Fig2A)2A) and together with only MDH2 for the clustering of DMD serum samples and aged matched healthy donors in the LUMC cohort (Fig ​(Fig2B).2B).

PMC4225696	I01006	Members of the serine hydrolase family share a serine centric charge relay system in their catalytic site and this common feature can be exploited with an activity-based probe to selectively label active serine hydrolases.
PMC4225696	I02000	The serine hydrolase family is one of the largest enzyme classes in humans and constitutes ~1% of predicted protein products from the eukaryotic genome.
PMC4225696	I02001	Serine hydrolases consist of greater than 100 serine proteases and approximately 110 esterases, lipases, peptidases and amidases [10].
PMC4225696	I02002	While some members are well-characterized (e.g. trypsin, elastase, thrombin, acetylcholinesterase), many have yet to be described [10].
PMC4225696	I02003	Indeed the role for ~50% of the non-serine proteases remains undetermined [10], and very little is known about the presence and role of serine hydrolases in the urine of healthy individuals.
PMC4225696	I02004	Therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the activity and composition of serine hydrolases in normal urine.
PMC4225696	I03001	The in-depth compositional analysis identified 62 serine hydrolases in normal urine independent of activity state.
PMC4225696	M01000	Serine hydrolase ABPP was optimized in normal urines with FP-TAMRA (2 μM)
PMC4225696	M01001	[ActivX FP-TAMRA serine hydrolase probe, Catalogue 88318, Thermo Fisher Scientific USA] at different pH, temperature and reaction times.
PMC4225696	M02001	Urinary serine hydrolase activity was found to be stable for up to 5 freeze thaw cycles.
PMC4225696	M03001	The concentrated sample (200 μl) was labeled with 2 μM FP-TAMRA probe [ActivX FP-TAMRA serine hydrolase probe, Catalogue 88318, Thermo Fisher Scientific USA] at pH 9, 37°C for 90 minutes.
PMC4225696	M06003	The 2D LC-MS/MS data of normal urinary proteins (n = 1846) were annotated against a list of serine hydrolases (n = 244) described by Cravatt et al.[8] and 4 other serine hydrolases identified in Uniprot.
PMC4225696	M06004	Serine hydrolases identified with high confidence GPM log10 (expectation) scores of less than -3 (n = 62) derived from this annotated list were used to generate Table 1.
PMC4225696	R00001	Urines were reacted with a fluorophosphonate probe tetramethylrhodamine (FP-TAMRA) which detects a broad range of serine hydrolase activities independent of the specific reactions that these enzymes catalyze.
PMC4225696	R02000	The FP-TAMRA labeled proteins in normal urine were affinity purified with an anti-TAMRA antibody [11] and analyzed by mass spectrometry as an approach to identifying the specific active serine hydrolases in normal urine.
PMC4225696	R03000	Thirteen active serine hydrolases were identified by MS/MS following the in-gel or in-solution digestion.
PMC4225696	R04001	Evidence of carboxyl ester lipase (bile salt-activated lipase) activity was demonstrated using 4-nitrophenol palmitate as substrate (Figure 4)
PMC4225696	R04003	The presence of kallikrein-1 (tissue kallikrein) and urokinase activity was demonstrated using the [D] Val-Leu-Arg-paranitronilide substrate (Figure 4)
PMC4225696	R04005	Collectively, these results confirmed the presence of several serine hydrolase activities in normal urine.
PMC4225696	R05000	Although the previous results identified the presence of active urinary serine hydrolases it was apparent that not all of the FP-TAMRA labeled species were isolated by affinity purification (Figure 3).
PMC4225696	R05001	Therefore, a 2D LC-MS/MS analysis of pooled healthy urine samples (n = 4) was undertaken as an alternate approach to determining the serine hydrolase composition of normal urine.
PMC4225696	R05002	The goal was to characterize the overall normal urinary serine hydrolase population; therefore pooled urines were utilized for biological averaging in lieu of individual biological replicates.
PMC4225696	R05004	A total of 62 serine hydrolases were identified with high confidence GPM log10 (expectation) scores of less than -3 (Table 1).
PMC4225696	R06002	Notably, myeloblastin (proteinase 3) appeared to be a low abundance protein [log10 (-5.9)] and plasma kallikrein was only detected with ABPP affinity purification, which supports the successful isolation of low abundance active proteins.
PMC4225696	R06003	Finally, several high abundance serine hydrolases (vitamin-K dependent protein Z, tripeptidyl-peptidase 1, complement factor I light chain) were not identified with ABPP affinity purification.
PMC4225696	R06004	Taken together, these data suggest that the active serine hydrolases identified were not due to non-specific binding of high abundance enzymes.
PMC4244100	A00010	Some blood proteins, such as flavin reductase (which converts biliverdin to bilirubin), were detected only in the HCV group.
PMC4244100	R03000	With regard to HCV infection, one of the specific proteins identified was flavin reductase (IPI IPI00783862), an oxidoreductase that catalyzes NADPH-dependent reduction and in the liver, converts biliverdin to bilirubin.
PMC4244100	R03002	Patients with HCV may experience increased oxidative stress due to the activation of NADPH oxidase, increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive nitrogen species (RNS), decreased antioxidants, iron overload and increased cytokines [20], [21].
PMC4244100	R04001	As expected, the majority of the detected peptides in all of the fractions correspond to alpha-amylase or serum albumin.
PMC4244100	R08006	A possible explanation for these elevations is that a necroinflammatory hepatic status can release iron and ferritin from damaged hepatocytes, a process also sustained by the concomitant high serum levels of serum alanine aminotransferase.
PMC4259987	D07015	Interestingly, a number of proteases as well as protease inhibitor enzymes are correlated with MMSE scores (Table 3; SERPINs F1 and G1, CST3, PCSK1N, B3GNT1) suggesting a direct role in cognitive function.

PMC4277649	A01005	The specificity and efficiency of several different proteases toward the digestion of the SA-Cys34-PhIP adduct were examined.

PMC4277649	I02004	The formation of these arylamine adducts with N-acetyltransferase has also been inferred by MS analysis of the intact protein; however, these adducts likewise undergo hydrolysis during proteolysis [23–26].
PMC4277649	I04002	Proteases of different specificities can digest proteins to polypeptide chains of different lengths.
PMC4277649	I04003	Combinations of several proteases can further break down proteins to smaller peptides or even monoamino acids, and different digestion strategies have been employed for digestion and quantification of proteins [29–31].
PMC4277649	I04004	However, the adduction of a bulky carcinogen to a protein can impact the efficacy of a protease, resulting in the occurrence of missed-cleaved peptides.
PMC4277649	I04005	For example, SA adducts of HAAs, therapeutics, acetaminophen, mustards or lipid peroxidation products formed at the Cys34 residue undergo digestion with pronase, trypsin, or a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin to produce C*PF, ALVLIAFAQYLQQC*PFEDHVK, LQQC*PF, or missed cleavage peptide LQQC*PFEDHVK
PMC4277649	I05000	The goals of our study were to establish a robust method to measure the arylsulfinamide adduct of PhIP formed with Cys34 of human SA, following its conversion to the stable arylsulfonamide structure, and to examine the proficiencies of different proteases to recover PhIP-adducted Cys34 peptides for measurement by ion trap MS.
PMC4277649	M01006	Sequence grade trypsin and chymotrypsin were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), and biochemical grade trypsin, chymotrypsin, proteinase K, pronase E, leucine aminopeptidase, and prolidase were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
PMC4277649	M06000	Pronase E digestion: PhIP-modified SA (5 μg, 75 pmol) in 50 μL 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) containing1 mM CaCl2 was treated with pronase E at a protease: protein ratio of 1:2 and 1:10 (w/w) for 20 h at 37 °C, followed by adduct enrichment with SPE
PMC4277649	M07000	Pronase E/leucine aminopeptidase/prolidase digestion: PhIP-modified SA (5 μg, 75 pmol) in 50 μL 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) containing MnCl2 (1 mM) and CaCl2 (1 mM) was treated with pronase E at a protease:protein ratio of 1:2 (w/w), leucine aminopeptidase at a protease: protein ratio of 1:30 (w/w), and prolidase at a protease:protein ratio of 1:8 (w/w).
PMC4277649	M08000	Proteinase K digestion: PhIP-modified SA (5 μg, 75 pmol) in 50 μL 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) was digested with proteinase K at a protease:protein ratio of 1:20 (w/w).
PMC4277649	R00006	In this study, we have examined the proficiency of digestion of the SA-Cys34 adducts of PhIP with pronase E, or a mixture of pronase E/leucine aminopeptidase/prolidase, proteinase K, chymotrypsin, and by treatment with trypsin/chymotrypsin.
PMC4277649	R01000	The major PhIP peptide adducts recovered from the different proteases are reported in Table 1.
PMC4277649	R01004	The C*PF sulfonamide adduct, along with only minor amounts of C*P and C* sulfonamide adducts, was also detected following proteolytic digestion with a 3-enzyme mixture containing pronase E, leucine aminopeptidase, and prolidase (Fig. S-2).
PMC4277649	R02000	Adduction products of mustards, acrylamide, and acetaminophen formed at the Cys34 of human SA are also resistant toward enzymatic hydrolysis and recovered principally as C*PF or QC*PF, following digestion with pronase [3,32,39].
PMC4277649	R02001	QC*PF was the predominant adduct of PhIP recovered with proteinase K, but the signal was much lower than the signal obtained from any of the other proteases.
PMC4277649	R03001	The corresponding chromatograms of the MS ion signals for major peptide adducts recovered from the different proteases are shown in Fig.
PMC4277649	R03004	The intensity of the LQQC*PFEDHVK (C-[SO2]-PhIP) signal obtained from trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion of SA was 10-fold or greater than the signal of the PhIP peptide adducts recovered following digestion of SA with other proteases (Fig. 4).
PMC4277649	R04005	These data signify that the charge state and not matrix effects are responsible for the high ionization efficiency and elevated response of the LQQC*PFEDHVK (C-[SO2]-PhIP) sulfonamide adduct over the singly protonated C*-[SO2]-PhIP adducts, and thereby explains the large differences in response of signals of the different PhIP peptide adducts obtained by digestion of SA with different proteases (Fig. 4).
PMC4277649	R05001	The stability of LQQC*PFEDHVK: LQQC*PˆFEDHVK (4.5 pmol, 1:1) toward the different proteases (trypsin, trypsin/chymotrypsin, pronase E, or pronase E, leucine aminopeptidase and prolidase) was examined by employing the same quantities of enzymes that were used for the digestion of PhIP-modified SA (5 μg) described above.
PMC4277649	R05004	In contrast, the unlabeled and the labeled (C-[SO2]-PhIP) sulfonamide peptide did undergo digestion with elevated levels of chymotrypsin, or by digestion with pronase E, or by treatment with pronase E/leucine aminopeptidase/prolidase to produce the same smaller peptides observed in the different proteolytic digests of PhIP-modified SA(Table 1).
PMC4277649	R05005	Thus, LQQC*PˆFEDHVK (C-[SO2]-PhIP) was selected as an internal standard to measure the amount of (C-[SO2]-PhIP) sulfonamide in SA digested by these different proteases.
PMC4277649	R06000	The estimates of the sulfonamide adducts were obtained by measurement of LQQC*PFEDHVK, LQQC*PF, QC*PF or C*PF in m-CPBA oxidized PhIP-modified SA, following digestion with, respectively, trypsin/chymotrypsin, chymotrypsin, pronase Eor pronase/leucine aminopeptidase/prolidase (Fig. 5).
PMC4277649	R10001	The adduct was recovered with the same efficiency from PhIP-modified SA digested with both grades of proteases (Fig. S-5), Thus, an economical and quantitative method was established to measure LQQC*PFEDHVK (C-[SO2]-PhIP) employing biochemical grade trypsin/chymotrypsin for proteolytic digestion of m-CPBA-oxidized PhIP-SA without denaturation of SA.

PMC4337938	I04002	On the other hand, four proteins (malate dehydrogenase, S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine hydrolase, EF-1α, and Hsp70) were previously reported to be differentially expressed in P. zopfii genotype 2
PMC4337938	I04004	Hence P. zopfii genotype 2 hyperimmune serum appeared to possess specific antibodies against two of the proteins, malate dehydrogenase and Hsp70, indicating a role of these two proteins in the immune reaction.
PMC4351086	A00008	Our studies interpret that An. stephensi (multiresistant) caused an upregulated expression of proteins and enzymes like cytochrome 450, short chain dehyrdogenase reductase, phosphodiesterase etc that may have an impact in insecticide resistance and xenobiotic detoxification.

PMC4351086	R02006	Mostly upregulated proteins are identified with putative function of oxido-reductase activity, catalytic activity, cell signaling, protein binding etc and mostly down regulated proteins found of unknown function, protein binding, transcription regulation, cell-cell recognition etc.
PMC4351086	R03000	Protein-protein interaction of most important upregulated protein i.e. short chain dehydrogenase reductase in multi-resistant strain of An. stephensi was analyzed using STRING 9.1 (http://string-db.org/)

PMC4357084	A00003	Previous work from our group demonstrated that Paracoccidioides presents enolase, as a protein able to bind and activate plasminogen, increasing the fibrinolytic activity of the pathogen, and the potential for adhesion and invasion of the fungus to host cells.

PMC4357084	M12006	The membrane was incubated blocking buffer [PBS 1X with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20] for 2 h, and then successively with anti-rFBA polyclonal antibodies (1:1000) and with the anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma Aldrich).
PMC4357084	R02003	Several enzymes were detected in this category, some of them presenting several isoforms, such as homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (spots 4,5), NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase (spots 6,7), phosphoglycerate kinase (spots 8,16) 2-methylcitrate synthase (spots 9,10,11), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (spots 13,14,15) and malate dehydrogenase (spots 20,21).
PMC4357084	R03001	The proteins: 2-methylcitrate synthase, FBA, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, formamidase, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase and phosphoglycerate kinase were detected in the secretome of Paracoccidioides, Pb01 yeast and mycelia
PMC4357084	R03003	Other proteins were identified in the secretome of Paracoccidioides, Pb18: fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase [49].
PMC4357084	R04001	In this way, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase was identified in the bacteria Leptospira interrogans [50]; phosphoglycerate kinase was described in C. albicans [40], Streptococcus pneumoniae [51], as well as in C. neoformans [15].
PMC4357084	R04002	In addition, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase were also described as Plg-binding proteins in C. albicans [40].
PMC4357084	R06002	In Paracoccidioides, enolase is present at the yeast cells surface, where it binds and activates hPlg, presumably contributing to the fungus pathogenesis [10].
PMC4357084	R06003	Other glycolytic enzymes, such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, were found here as Plg-binding proteins (Figure 1B, Table 1).
PMC4357084	R06004	Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), is a molecule that binds Plg and is present on the surface and secretome of bacteria [56-58] and fungi [40].
PMC4357084	R06007	In studies conducted by our group, Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is located at the surface of Paracoccidioides, where could mediate the adhesion and internalization of the fungus to host cells, binding to ECM components [62].
PMC4357084	R07000	Phosphoglycerate kinase is an adhesin in both, bacteria [63] and fungi [15,40].
PMC4357084	R07004	In C. neoformans, phosphoglycerate kinase localizes to the fungal cell wall, where exhibits accessible carboxyl-terminal lysine residues for Plg-binding [65].
PMC4357084	R08007	So, due to the relevance of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase as an adhesin and a Plg-binding protein that promotes the virulence of microorganisms, the protein was selected for further investigation in Paracoccidioides.
PMC4357084	R09004	A Far-western blotting with increasing concentrations of rFBA was obtained, and depicted in Figure 2B. Concentrations of 0.1 μg to 3 μg of the recombinant protein were subjected to Far-western, demonstrating a dose-dependent binding of the protein with Plg, showing that, in fact, the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase of Paracoccidioides binds to the Plg.
PMC4357084	R10010	These data suggest that fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, can somehow influence fibrinolytic activity of yeast cells.
PMC4357084	R11000	We next investigated whether the capture of Plg by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, favors the generation of plasmin.
PMC4357084	R12009	By capturing and activating Plg, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase can promote the spread of the fungus, certainly by matrix degradation, paving the way for infection toward internal organs.
PMC4357084	R13007	The data strongly suggest a role for the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase in the infective process in macrophages.
PMC4357084	R14000	Similar experiments with other proteins such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and triose phosphate isomerase, that promoted reduced interaction of Paracoccidioides with pneumocytes and Vero cells, were reported [62,76].
PMC4357084	R14004	Our data suggest that binding of the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase to Plg, may increase the virulence of this pathogen.

PMC4358004	A00005	The morphology of the ΔenvC deletion mutant was identical to that of the wild-type strain, but it showed a drastic reduction of periplasmic proteins, including the chaperones HtrA, SurA, and Skp, and an accumulation of β-barrel-containing outer membrane proteins comprising the autotransporters Hap, IgA serine protease, and HMW2A, as observed by proteomic analysis.
PMC4358004	D02001	This observation was quite surprising considering the essential role played by E. coli EnvC in amidase activation (27).
PMC4358004	D02003	Indeed, NTHI EnvC could modulate the activity of other proteases involved in peptidoglycan cleavage, as reported for EnvC in E. coli (14, 27).
PMC4358004	D06006	Also, the decreased resistance to human sera could be derived from the defects in the functionality of surface determinants involved in this system like IgA protease and P5 (26, 41).

PMC4390597	I02001	Studies of the postmortem brain, especially the frontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, found expressional changes in dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2, carbonic anhydrase, and aldolase C. This finding suggests that brain development and energy metabolism may be associated with depression.18,19 A recent study on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex also found associations between MDD, energy metabolism, and synaptic function.20 However, these studies had limitations, namely that the investigations were done only in a limited brain area.
PMC4396075	D00001	These articles cited poor negative predictive values of dipstick tests (57-76%), measuring nitrite, leukocyte esterase (LE), and hemoglobin levels.
PMC4396075	D00006	In five cases with K. pneumoniae as the infectious agent, nitrite-inducible formate dehydrogenase, nitrite reductase, nitrite extrusion protein 1, and subunits of nitrate reductase 1 and NADPH-dependent nitrite reductase were quite abundant in the bacterial proteome.
PMC4396075	D00013	An Leukocyte esterase assay score of 1+ may account for poor specificity considering that 6 of 11 cases with this score revealed the presence of Lactobacillus and 3 cases low quantities of UPEC, suggesting colonization rather than UTI in these patients.
PMC4396075	D02007	While we could not differentiate cases of UTI and ASB (data on clinical symptoms were unavailable), we identified three cases where low neutrophil-derived inflammation and low Leukocyte esterase scores coincided with strong proteomic evidence of urethral colonization by a pathogen.
PMC4396075	D03002	The NAD score assesses inflammation with specificity results comparable to those observed with the Leukocyte esterase assay and microscopic counts of leukocytes.
PMC4396075	D03006	The protein profiles also had increased quantities of histones which, together with myeloperoxidase and ELANE, are the antibacterial effectors in neutrophil extracellular traps [48].

PMC4396075	R02004	[31]; proteins implicated in the formation, trafficking, and fusion of granules with phagolysosomes, including grancalcin (GCA), plastin-2 (LCP1), annexin A3 (ANXA3), and tetraspanin (CD63 antigen); proteins influencing neutrophil migration in the milieu of a reorganizing extracellular matrix, such as integrin αM/β2, gelatinase (MMP9), and neutrophil collagenase (MMP8); and NADPH oxidase, an enzyme with multiple subunits including cytochrome b-245 (CYBA, Figure 3) located in the membrane of phagolysosomes of phagocytic cells and responsible for the oxidative burst that directly kills pathogens.
PMC4396075	R02009	Eosinophil peroxidase (Eosinophil peroxidase) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) both of which are also effectors of the response towards pathogens were an order of magnitude less abundant than neutrophil-derived proteins, thus not supporting a major role of eosinophils in the inflammatory response.
PMC4396075	R03003	The LE score measures leukocyte esterase activity, likely representing primarily elastase (ELANE) and myeloblastin (PRTN3), two neutrophil proteases quantified for eight samples in Figure 3.
PMC4396075	R03009	It measures the sum of abundances of 35 proteins enriched in neutrophils and may be less susceptible to false positive results compared to the Leukocyte esterase assay.
PMC4396075	R04002	Summed abundances of 32 red blood cell proteins, including hemoglobin subunits, band 3 anion transport protein, band 7 integral membrane protein, and carbonic anhydrase-1, relative to total protein content in each UP sample were determined, shown by the green bar segments of the plot displayed in Figure 2.
PMC4396075	R04004	There was no evidence of a good correlation of either NAD scores or Leukocyte esterase assay results with ERY scores, suggesting that, even in the cases of detection of a pathogen (shown by the coloration of the horizontal bar at the bottom of the plot in Figure 2), neutrophil infiltration of the urinary tract does not always entail significant hematuria and tissue injury.

PMC4397369	I02000	Chymotrypsin-like protease was first described as an allergen from Aspergillus fumigatus.4 Chymotrypsin-like serine proteases were also identified as allergens from house dust mites5,6,7; however, only a small amount of mite chymotrypsin was found in the extract, suggesting a limited role in mite allergenicity.8
PMC4397369	R00003	Bla g 3 (48) was the most frequently identified allergen-like clone, followed by Bla g 8 (23), Bla g 11 (13), glutathione S-transferases (12), trypsin (9), arginine kinase (8), Bla g 1 (3) and chymotrypsin (3).

PMC4603979	D07001	The degradation pathway is initiated by endopeptidases of the aspartic and cysteine classes (cathepsin D supported by cathepsin L and legumain), after which a cathepsin B participates in the production of smaller fragments, and finally the pool of peptide fragments is degraded into dipeptides and amino acids through the action of cathepsin C, cathepsin B, a carboxipeptidase and a leucine aminopeptidase [16, 43].
PMC4603979	D07004	We also identified several proteins with metalloprotease activity, some of which could exert functions similar to that of leucine aminopeptidase, since they belong to the same enzyme class (metallopeptidase class)

PMC4603979	R10002	The most numerous protein classes were nucleic acid binding (15.7 % in unfed and 20.7 % in fed) and hydrolases (16.3 % in unfed and 14.0 % in fed), followed by oxidoreductases (14.0 % in unfed and 13.3 % in fed), transferases (12.8 % in unfed and 12.7 % in 12.7), enzyme modulators (8.7 % in unfed and 9.3 % in fed), cytoskeletal proteins (9.3 % in unfed and 8.0 % in fed), transporter (6.4 % in unfed and 7.3 % in fed) and membrane traffic proteins (4.1 % in unfed and 8.7 % in fed).
PMC4603979	R14001	These proteases belonged to four different groups (aspartic-type endopeptidase, cysteine-type endopetidase, metallopeptidase and serine-type endopeptidase), except two of them, in which the type of enzyme activity has still not been characterized (B4NAG0, B7PXW8).

PMC4709002	R04003	These data give insight into relative abundance of specific proteins during feeding: proteases (Fig 3A), protease inhibitors (Fig 3B), lipocalins/tick histamine-binding proteins/fatty acid binding proteins (Fig 4A), anti-microbial/immunity-related (Fig 4B), heme-binding proteins (Fig 4C), anti-oxidants (Fig 4D), proteins of unknown function (Fig 5A), glycine rich proteins (Fig 5B) and extracellular matrix proteins (Fig 5C).

PMC4709002	R05002	When searched against the Merops database [59], the 26 metalloproteases belong to families M12 (n = 15), M20 (n = 4), M2 (n = 2), M28 (n = 2), M13 (n = 1), M17 (n = 1), and M49 (n = 1) (S2 Table), while serine, cysteine and aspartic proteases are classified in families S1, C1 and A1 respectively.
PMC4709002	R05005	Whether or not the observation in this study that majority of proteases in I. scapularis tick saliva are metalloproteases reflects the protease composition in I. scapularis genome or it is a physiological event, is unknown at this point.
PMC4709002	R06001	The remaining metalloproteases in families M17, 20, 28 and 49, which were abundant in BD and SD (Fig 3A) are not likely associated with regulating tick feeding events.
PMC4709002	R07000	The observation that I. scapularis predominantly secreted family M12 metalloproteases during feeding is suggestive of the importance of this protein class in tick feeding physiology.
PMC4709002	R07002	A recombinant protein of M12 protease (AAP22067.1, MCC Fig 3A) has gelatinase and fibrin(ogen)olytic activities [69], which is a pro-tick feeding event.

PMC4709002	R08000	The first line of host defense to tick feeding such as inflammation, platelet aggregation, blood clotting, complement activation, and cellular immunity are mediated by proteases that are controlled by protease inhibitors (PI).
PMC4709002	R08003	In this study, we identified 43 putative PIs (S1 Table), which according to the Merops database belong in eight families: I2 (Kunitz type serine protease inhibitors, n = 2), I4 (serine protease inhibitors, [serpins], n = 11), I8 (TIL domain serine protease inhibitors, n = 13), I25 (cystatins, cysteine protease inhibitors, n = 4), I31 (thyropins, cysteine protease inhibitors n = 2), I39 (α-2 macroglobulin, A2M, n = 9), I43 (Kazal type serine protease inhibitors, n = 1), and I68 (carboxypeptidase inhibitors, TCI, n = 1) were identified in I. scapularis saliva (S2 Table).
PMC4709002	R08005	The observation here that majority of PIs in this study are likely inhibitors of serine proteases could signal the potential that most host defense pathways to tick feeding are likely serine protease mediated.
PMC4709002	R12005	It is notable that in Radulovic et al., [40], alongside lipocalins/HBPs, a leukotriene B4-like protease was also found among 24–48 h A. americanum immunogenic tick saliva proteins.

PMC4709002	R18002	It is interesting to note in this study thioredoxin peroxidase protein in non-infected ticks decreased with feeding (S3 Table).
PMC4709002	R24007	The latter is highly identical to A. americanum tick feeding stimuli responsive acidic chitinase [134], which when silenced by RNAi caused ticks to loosely attach onto host skin

PMC4745805	R08003	Most striking is the presence of lysomal/ late endosomal proteins (11- and 7-fold increase respectively), but also the presence of small GTPase, calcium binding and GST-binding proteins is noteworthy.
PMC4745805	R10000	Several known protein complexes were enriched in prostate cancer patients urinary exosomes, such as the Vacuolar H+ ATPase and the LAMTOR (late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activator/regulator) complexes (average enrichment 3.7 and 4.5 respectively) (Figure ​(Figure6),6), thus suggesting that these proteins may have a specific role in exosome release from prostate cancer cells.
PMC4745805	R10010	A similar map for the interactions of the 25 down-regulated proteins in urinary exosomes from prostate cancer patients could indicate a central role of the tyrosine kinase Lck, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and ESCRT-0 proteins STAM1/2 for signalling events abolished in exosomes from prostatic cancer tissue (Supplemental Fig S5B).

PMC4762516	R12003	The most abundant protein activities of the secreted proteins were those encoding classes of cell adhesion/cell junction activity and hydrolase and protease activity (Fig. 5C).
PMC4762516	R13005	For example, the Rickettsia chaperone proteins, HtpG, DnaK, NADPH reductase, and cytosolic aminopeptidase, were enriched in the Golgi fractions, consistent with either contamination of Golgi fraction with Rickettsia organisms or biological processing of rickettsial proteins by the host Golgi pathway.
PMC4762516	R13006	The cytochrome c oxidase and NADH-quinone oxidoreductases were observed in the Golgi preparations, perhaps suggesting that these molecules may be a source of enhanced superoxide and lipid peroxidation observed in Rickettsia-infected endothelial cells (31).

PMC4825924	A00003	Here, we demonstrate that the yeast palmitoyl transferase ScAkr1p homolog, AkrA in Aspergillus nidulans, regulates [Ca2+]c homeostasis.
PMC4825924	A00005	The [Ca2+]c dynamics in living cells expressing the calcium reporter aequorin in different akrA mutant backgrounds were defective in their [Ca2+]c responses to high extracellular Ca2+ stress or drugs that cause ER or plasma membrane stress.
PMC4825924	A00006	All of these effects on the [Ca2+]c responses mediated by AkrA were closely associated with the cysteine residue of the AkrA DHHC motif, which is required for palmitoylation by AkrA. Using the acyl-biotin exchange chemistry assay combined with proteomic mass spectrometry, we identified protein substrates palmitoylated by AkrA including two new putative P-type ATPases (Pmc1 and Spf1 homologs), a putative proton V-type proton ATPase (Vma5 homolog) and three putative proteins in A. nidulans, the transcripts of which have previously been shown to be induced by extracellular calcium stress in a CrzA-dependent manner.
PMC4825924	A01000	Palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification catalyzed by palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) and proteins that undergo this modification are involved in numerous intracellular functions.
PMC4825924	A01001	Yeast Akr1p was the first characterized palmitoyl transferase whilst HIP14, an Akr1p homolog in human, is one of the most highly conserved of 23 human PATs that catalyze the addition of palmitate to the Huntington protein which is of major importance in Huntington’s disease.
PMC4825924	A01004	In this study, we demonstrate that the palmitoyl transferase Akr1 homolog in the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, similar to the high-affinity calcium uptake system (HACS), is required for normal growth and sporulation in the presence of low extracellular calcium.
PMC4825924	D00002	Yeast Akr1p was the first characterized palmitoyl transferase (palmitoyl transferase)
PMC4825924	D00008	In this study, we identified that homologs of the yeast palmitoyl transferase in A. nidulans (AkrA) and A. fumigatus (AfAkrA) are required for hyphal growth and sporulation under low external calcium conditions.
PMC4825924	D00012	Among them were: a vacuolar Ca2+ ATPase Pmc1 homolog
PMC4825924	D00013	[63]; a putative P-type ATPase Spf1 homolog, which is involved in ER function and calcium homeostasis in budding yeast and Candida albicans [58,64,65]; a Vma5 homolog that has been linked with Pmr1 Ca2+-ATPase function [59], and three calcium signaling- related proteins (encoded by AN8774.4, AN3420.4 and AN2724.4), the transcripts of which have been previously shown to be induced in response to high extracellular calcium stress which is dependent on the transcription factor CrzA
PMC4825924	D00017	PmcA and SpfA are homologs of two Ca2+ ATPases which response for sequestrating calcium into intercellular compartments in S. cerevisiae [63,64].
PMC4825924	D01010	PmrA is an A. nidulans homolog of yeast Pmr1, which is a P-type Golgi Ca2+/Mn2+ ATPase responsible for Ca2+ transport into the Golgi and widely accepted as responsible for Ca2+ efflux from the cytoplasm into the Golgi to regulate calcium signaling and homeostasis and prevent calcium toxicity.
PMC4825924	D03000	Altogether, our results provide the first report that AkrA is a putative palmitoyl transferase in A. nidulans, and it mediates calcium influx in a DHHC-dependent mechanism to perform an essential function in calcium homeostasis/signaling for survival under high extracellular calcium-, ER- or azole antifungal-stress conditions.
PMC4825924	D04000	Calcium signaling regulators have been previously identified as antifungal target candidates, including FK506, which targets calcineurin [8].
PMC4825924	D05000	Previous studies have shown that all AkrA homologs across different species require the DHHC motif to be active and function normally as palmitoyl transferases [69–71].
PMC4825924	D05014	When we treated cells with a specific palmitoyl transferase analogue inhibitor 2-BP, AkrA localization within the Golgi localization was completely lost (Fig 8D), suggesting that the 2-BP treatment not only prevented AkrA auto-acyltation but also prevented the normal subcellular localization of AkrA.
PMC4825924	D06000	In conclusion, our results provide the first report that AkrA is a palmitoyl transferase in A. nidulans, and that it mediates calcium influx in a DHHC-dependent mechanism to perform an essential role in calcium homeostasis to survive high extracellular calcium-, ER- and plasma membrane-stress conditions.

PMC4825924	I01000	The phosphatase calcineurin is an important [Ca2+]c transient effector and is conserved from yeast to humans.
PMC4825924	I01010	In the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, there is a calcineurin-dependent Crz1 homolog, known as CrzA. Interestingly, calcineurin deletion causes more severe growth defects than CrzA deletion in this species, suggesting that calcineurin has additional target proteins other than CrzA
PMC4825924	I02001	Palmitoyl transferases (PATs) are known to be responsible for palmitoylation.
PMC4825924	I02002	The defining feature of PATs is the presence of a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) with an Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif, which is required for palmitoyl transferase activity.
PMC4825924	I03000	In this study, we have demonstrated that AnAkrA in A. nidulans and AfAkrA in A. fumigatus, which are homologs of the yeast palmitoyl transferase ScAkr1p, have similar function to the HACS in the presence of low extracellular calcium.
PMC4825924	I03002	Moreover, using codon-optimized aequorin as a calcium reporter in living cells, we found that AkrA dysfunction significantly decreased the amplitude of the [Ca2+]c transient induced by an extracellular calcium stimulus, ER stress caused by tunicamycin or plasma membrane stress resulting from itraconazole, respectively.
PMC4825924	I03004	Moreover, we have identified that two new putative P-type ATPases (Pmc1 and Spf1 homologs), a putative proton V-type proton ATPase (Vma5 homolog) and three putative CrzA-dependent proteins, are palmitoylated substrates of the AkrA protein.
PMC4825924	R00000	Based on a NCBI BLASTp search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), we identified a putative ortholog of NFAT in A. nidulans, AkrA (AN5824.4, Accession: XP_663428.1), which encodes a putative palmitoyltransferase.
PMC4825924	R00002	Interestingly, a bioinformatic analysis revealed that the promoter region contains a putative calcineurin-dependent-response-element (CDRE-like) motif.
PMC4825924	R04004	Since Cys487 in the DHHC motif has previously been shown to be crucial for palmitoyl transferase activity, we therefore mutated Cys487 to Ser487 in the DHHC motif (Fig 3A)
PMC4825924	R07000	Previous studies have demonstrated that pmr1, which encodes a Ca2+/Mn2+ P-type ATPase and is involved in Ca2+ homeostasis, localizes to the Golgi in yeast [37].
PMC4825924	R08002	We monitored the extracellular calcium-induced [Ca2+]c changes in living cells of A. nidulans wild type and mutant strains in which we expressed codon-optimized aequorin [42–44].
PMC4825924	R09001	[45–47], suggesting that other Ca2+-ATPases may compensate for the loss of PmrA function in response to the extracellular calcium stimulus.
PMC4825924	R10002	These data suggest that the inhibition of palmitoyl transferase activity can significantly block calcium influx.
PMC4825924	R11000	Activation of Ca2+ channels, calmodulin, calcineurin and other factors is necessary for the long-term survival of cells undergoing ER stress, and during this process the HACS components, CchA and MidA, are required for Ca2+ influx from the extracellular environment [41,50,51].
PMC4825924	R13006	Several previous reports have suggested that the process of palmitoylation involves in a two-step mechanism in which palmitoyl transferase is auto-acylated by itself to create an intermediate followed by the transfer of the palmitoyl moiety to its substrate [53,54].
PMC4825924	R15006	In our study we notably identified the following protein substrates palmitoylated by AkrA: a vacuolar Ca2+-ATPase Pmc1 homolog (AN5088.4); a P-type ATPase Spf1 homolog (AN3146.4) involved in calcium homeostasis [58]; a putative V-type H+-ATPase Vma5 homolog (AN1195.4) that has been linked to Ca2+-ATPase function [59], and three uncharacterized proteins (AN8774.4, AN3420.4 and AN2427.4), the transcripts of which have previously been shown to be induced by extracellular calcium stress in a CrzA-dependent manner [53].

PMC4881457	R08001	For example, the accumulation of osteopontin (Figure 6a), uteroglobin, calreticulin, CD59 glycoprotein, vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) (Figure 6b), prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase, superoxide dismutase (Figure 6c), and guanylin was detected only in the most advanced CKD stages.
PMC4882050	A00001	Our research team previously reported the production in vitro of Cyst-Like Structures (CLS) sharing structural features with cysts, including rounded shape, size reduction, multinucleation, and the formation of a chitin wall coupled to the overexpression of glucosamine 6-phosphate isomerase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the chitin synthesis pathway.
PMC4882050	D01006	Furthermore, the expression of mRNA encoding for the cyst wall proteins Jessie 1, Jessie 3, and Jacob, but not Jessie 2 nor chitin synthase, were identified by RT-PCR in CLS, suggesting that at least the mRNA encoding for two Jessie and the Jacob proteins were present.
PMC4882050	D03003	Furthermore, metabolic enzymes such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, NADP-dependent alcohol-dehydrogenase-1, and phosphoglycerate kinase were also identified with high peptide-hit scores.
PMC4882050	D03005	In addition, we also detected proteins that have previously been associated with the virulence and pathogenicity of E. histolytica such as peroxiredoxin and alcohol dehydrogenase 3 [22,23].

PMC4882050	I01006	Other studies have included phagosome composition and proteins associated to the phagocytosis process [12–16], the cell surface proteome that identified 12 protein families [17], the pre-mRNA splicing complexes that identified 36 proteins as involved, and other 50 proteins as possibly involved in co-transcriptional processes [18], 33 proteins modulated in cells overexpressing the EhPC4 transcription factor [19] and a pull-down assay that identified two endoribonucleases interacting with the EhCAF1 deadenylase [20].
PMC4882050	I01008	About 1,500 proteins were grouped into two main classes, traffic machinery and GTPases, and about 100 markers were identified in both compartments [21].
PMC4882050	I01009	Additionally, a comparison of the E. histolytica proteome with that of the related non-pathogen amoeba E. dispar has allowed the identification of peroxiredoxin and alcohol dehydrogenase 3 as proteins associated to virulence and pathogenicity [22,23].
PMC4882050	I02010	These CLS showed features closely resembling genuine cysts, including rounded shape, size reduction, refringence, multinucleation (mainly 2 or 3 nuclei, and occasionally 4), and overexpression of glucosamine 6-phosphate isomerase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the chitin synthesis pathway [32].
PMC4882050	I02011	In a subsequent study, CLS formation by hydrogen peroxide was inhibited in trophozoites in which glucosamine 6-phosphate isomerase expression was silenced by siRNA [33].
PMC4882050	R03003	It is remarkable that peptide-hits for cellular metabolism proteins like pyruvate phosphate dikinase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, and galactokinase were more than double in trophozoites than in CLS and cysts (Table 2).
PMC4882050	R03004	In contrast, peptide-hit score was higher, in some cases two or three times higher, for oxidative stress enzymes like peroxiredoxin and two HSP70 (Bip and a putative one), as well as for disulfide isomerase and EF-hand calcium-binding domain-containing proteins in CLS samples than in trophozoites and cysts.
PMC4882050	R04006	In contrast, cysts showed high expression levels of many putative uncharacterized proteins (8 out 15 proteins with the highest peptide-hit score) in addition to a putative nuclear transcription factor, an aminoglycoside 3’-phosphotransferase, and an alkyl sulfatase.
PMC4882050	R08001	Three proteins that were identified as less abundant in CLS with respect to trophozoites (malic enzyme, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
PMC4882050	R08003	In agreement with the proteomic results, the RT-PCR showed that malic enzyme and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase were not expressed in CLS, in contrast with trophozoites where the expression was clearly detected (Fig 5).
PMC4882050	R09001	In addition, CLS overexpress glucosamine 6-phosphate isomerase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the chitin synthesis pathway, suggesting an activation of the chitin formation route in CLS.
PMC4882050	R09003	Thus, the expression of genes encoding for some of these proteins was evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using E. histolytica specific primers for Jessie 1, 2, and 3; the Jacob protein; and chitin synthase.
PMC4882050	R10001	Although CLS have a detergent-resistant wall suggesting the presence of chitin, no chitin synthase expression was detected in that stage (Fig 6).
PMC4893419	A02001	From the list, we identified a number of functionally significant proteins including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, S100 proteins, AXL receptor protein tyrosine kinase, macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), programmed cell death ligand 2 (PDCD1LG2), TNF receptor 2, (TNFRSF1B) and many novel proteins including hyaluronan-binding protein 2, semaphorin 4A (SEMA4D) and osteoclast stimulating factor 1.

PMC4893419	R03001	It belongs to the peptidyl arginine deiminase family of enzymes that carries out citrullination reactions, the post-translational deimination reaction of proteins accompanied by the conversion of arginine residues into citrullines [48].
PMC4893419	R03004	We also observed angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) which has been previously reported to be overexpressed in synovial stroma in patients with RA as compared to those with osteoarthritis [51].
PMC4893419	R03005	An increase in the levels of angiotensin converting enzyme essentially reflects the production of angiogensin II, which is a local vasoconstrictor [51].
PMC4893419	R03006	From this work, we observed matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and cysteine proteases, which are critical mediators of bone erosion.
PMC4893419	R03008	These are collagenases that degrade proteins of the extracellular matrix in the affected joints [9, 52].
PMC4893419	R03009	Cysteine proteases, referred to as the cathepsins, were also found and they include cathepsin B, D, H, S and Z types and are actively involved in bone resorption [53].
PMC4893419	R04012	Role of vascularisation in the synovium of RA patients by AXL receptor tyrosine kinase has also been studied earlier; thus its presence in our list is in agreement with previous studies [61] (MS/MS spectrum of one its peptides is shown in Fig. 2b).

PMC4910742	A00002	We combined immunological and proteomic approaches and identified CD245 as the unconventional myosin 18A, a highly conserved motor enzyme reported as a receptor for the surfactant protein A (SP-A), that plays a critical role in cytoskeleton organization and Golgi budding.
PMC4910742	D00001	It is worthy to mention that by using a polyclonal antibody against surfactant protein A-receptor (SP-R)-210 that was previously shown to detect myosin 18A,17

PMC4910742	M01001	Mouse anti-human CD245 (DY12), or granzyme B (clone GrB-7, DAKO) monoclonal antibody (mAb) was used as primary antibody, followed by biotin-conjugated anti-mouse Ig antibody and revealed with the streptavidin-peroxidase (LSAB kit, Dako, Les Ulis, France).

PMC4910742	R06000	As previously demonstrated, CD245 was found associated with a phosphatase activity in the YT2C2 NK cell line.36 Among the main phosphatases involved in NKRs-mediated signaling pathways are the Src-homology domain-containing phosphatases (SHP) such as the SH2 domain-containing inositol 5′-phosphatase (SHIP), SHP-1 and SHP-2.
PMC4910742	R06001	These phosphatases interact with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on other proteins through their SH2 domains.28-31 We thus investigated whether myosin 18A was able to recruit SHP-1, SHP-2 or SHIP.

PMC4998552	A01000	We aimed to identify serum sialoglycoproteins that are targeted by neuraminidases in severe pneumococcal infection.
PMC4998552	A02000	We constructed serum sialoglycoprotein profiles before and after pneumococcal neuraminidase treatment using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), a proteomic approach.
PMC4998552	A03000	The most abundant serum sialoglycoproteins identified by LC-MS/MS after neuraminidase treatment and peanut lectin capture were immunoglobulins, apolipoproteins, fibrinogens, keratins, complement system proteins, and fetuin-A. Serum fetuin-A levels in the HUS patients were significantly lower (207 ± 80 mg/L, P < 0.001) than in patients with lobar pneumonia (610 ± 190 mg/L) as well as the healthy controls (630 ± 250 mg/L).
PMC4998552	D00000	Neuraminidase-producing organisms like S. pneumoniae acquire sialic acid by cleaving host sialoglycoconjugates and use it as carbon and nitrogen source.10 During pneumococcal infection, cleavage of sialyl linkages to expose TA in host cells is due to a higher neuraminidase activity from NanA, NanB, or NanC or an additive effect of the three.3 Previously, S. pneumoniae serotype 2 (strain R6) and serotype 4 (strain TIGR4) were used to confirm α2-3 sialyl linkages specificity of the NanB and NanC.19,20
PMC4998552	D00001	This study used a serotype 14 strain to confirm substrate specificity of pneumococcal neuraminidases both in vitro and ex vivo; NanA showed activity toward both α2-3 and α2-6 sialyl linkages, while both NanB and NanC cleaved only α2-3 sialyl linkages.
PMC4998552	D01000	The most abundant serum sialoglycoproteins identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after neuraminidase treatment and peanut lectin capture were immunoglobulins, apolipoproteins, fibrinogens, keratins, complement system proteins, and fetuin-A. Sialoglycoproteins AGP, fibrinogen, and CRP are currently being used as biomarkers in the clinically setting.
PMC4998552	D02004	In this study, LC/MS data revealed that coagulation factors including high molecular weight kininogen, fibrinogen, and factor XII were targeted by pneumococcal neuraminidases, but in vitro experiment verified that only NanA could prolong aPTT.
PMC4998552	D03003	The bovine fetuin concentrations used to inhibit neuraminidases in vitro were 2 to 4 times greater than the concentration of fetuin-A in human serum; therefore, it is possible that other sialo-glycoproteins in addition to fetuin-A could have some protective effect during pneumococcal infection, but this requires further studies to verify.
PMC4998552	D03004	As a major sialoglycoprotein in human serum, neuraminidase activity in blood in patients with IPD could be titrated by fetuin-A and the low concentration of fetuin-A or other sialoglycoproteins may indirectly reflect the severity of the infection.
PMC4998552	D04001	In addition, all the 3 pneumococcal neuraminidases released following autolysis of pneumococci could reach the circulatory system and the overall activity of the 3 neuraminidases would predispose children with severe pulmonary infection to HUS.3 Invasive pneumococcal infection is a common cause of HUS in Taiwan and the United States, and pneumococcal HUS is invariably associated with prolonged hospital stays.32,33 Detection of TA activation using PNA was thought to be the most appropriate test to support the diagnosis of pneumococcal HUS.34

PMC4998552	I00003	We thus speculated that NanC might contribute to the risk of developing HUS in an additive manner in the presence of NanA and NanB by increasing the overall activity of pneumococcal neuraminidases, and so was associated with the occurrence of HUS following pneumococcal infection.3

PMC4998552	M00001	NanC proteins of S. pneumoniae strain CGSP14 were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography using Nickel-Chelating Resin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).9,10 To identify serum sialoglycoproteins that are targeted by pneumococcal neuraminidases, human serum was treated with NanA, NanB, and NanC and asialoglycoproteins were captured by peanut lectin (PNA) conjugated agarose column (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and the eluted sample was analyzed by Western blot hybridization.11,12 And protein samples were submitted to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.13
PMC4998552	R00005	Immunoglobulins, apolipoproteins, fibrinogens, keratins, and complement system proteins were predominantly desialylated by NanA and NanC. Eight proteins were found to be common in both untreated and neuraminidase-treated samples.

PMC5047454	A00003	Substantial differences were found in the levels of particular outer membrane proteins between resistant and sensitive strains, i.e. outer membrane protease E (PgtE) was present mainly in resistant strains, while sensitive strains possessed a high level of flagellar hook-associated protein 2 (FliD) and significantly higher levels of outer membrane protein A (OmpA).
PMC5047454	D02004	The experiments showed, that the main difference in the OMP composition was a relatively high level of outer membrane protease E (PgtE, spot A, Fig 3I) and a low level of flagellar hook associated protein 2 (FliD, spots B and C, Fig 3II) in resistant strains: S. Enteritidis 27 and S. Enteritidis 851.

PMC5050164	A00000	Kinases are one of the most important families of enzymes that are involved in numerous cell signaling processes.
PMC5050164	A00001	Existing methods for studying kinase expression and activation have limited kinome coverage.
PMC5050164	A00005	In particular, we found that methylglyoxal treatment gave rise to altered expression of a number of kinases in the MAPK pathway and diminished expression of several receptor tyrosine kinases, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), etc.
PMC5050164	D00000	Reversible phosphorylation of proteins and other biomolecules by kinases and phosphatases constitute one of the most important and best studied pathways in cell signaling.
PMC5050164	D00004	In particular, our expanded kinome library covers approximately 80% of human kinome and contains 474 human kinases (488 unique IPIs), among which 409, 14 and 51 were protein kinases, lipid kinases, and other kinases, respectively.
PMC5050164	D01001	Among these quantified kinases, 49 were perturbed, 8 of which were RTKs.
PMC5050164	D01007	In addition, the capability of NAC in restoring the MG-induced decreases in all three receptor tyrosine kinases is in keeping with the previous proposal that hyperglycemia-induced ROS activates many pathways of tissue damage in diabetic patients.40,41 Our results suggest that the inhibition of RTKs may contribute to the development of diabetic complications, and restoration of the functions of RTKs may provide new venues for the therapeutic interventions of diabetic complications.
PMC5050164	I00000	Kinases are responsible for catalyzing the phosphorylation of numerous biological molecules,1 and they play crucial roles in cell signaling and regulating cell proliferation and metabolism.2 Aberrant expression and/or activation of kinases have been found in cancer and other human diseases.3
PMC5050164	I00002	Recently published results showed that ATP-affinity probes could be employed for the covalent labeling, enrichment, and subsequent mass spectrometric identification and quantification of kinases with excellent specificity and sensitivity (Figure 1, Figure S1).4,5
PMC5050164	I01003	The previous version of the kinome library encompassed 320 unique peptides from 242 kinases, among which approximately 200 were protein kinases.
PMC5050164	I01006	In addition, a similar number of kinases were identified with the use of kinome beads for kinase enrichment.13–16 Thus, monitoring the majority of the human kinome necessitates the expansion of the MRM kinome library.
PMC5050164	I02001	In addition, MG can react with DNA and induce the formation of N2-(1-carboxyethyl)-2′-deoxyguanosine (N2-CEdG) as the major stable DNA adduct.19,20 However, no study has been conducted about how MG perturbs cell signaling by altering the expression or activation of kinases at the global kinome level.
PMC5050164	I03002	More than 300 unique kinases were quantified; a number of kinases in the MAPK pathway and several receptor tyrosine kinases were found to be substantially altered in response to methylglyoxal treatment.
PMC5050164	I03003	Together, we expanded successfully our MRM kinome library to achieve an unprecedented coverage of the human kinome and our study also provided important insights into the roles of kinase signaling in the development of diabetic complications.
PMC5050164	M01001	Synthetic kinase peptides harboring a desthiobiotin-modified lysine were obtained from New England Peptide, Inc. and analyzed by 1D-LC-MS/MS, as described in detail in the Supplementary Materials.
PMC5050164	M02000	All LC-MS/MS data obtained from discovery-mode proteomic analysis were searched against the human IPI protein database version 3.68 (87,062 entries) by using MaxQuant (Version 1.3.0.5).22 Skyline (version 3.5)23 was used to construct spectral libraries for kinase peptides.
PMC5050164	M06002	cDNA was synthesized by using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) and an oligo(dT)16 primer.
PMC5050164	R01003	A maximum of five peptides were selected for each kinase, and the three or four most abundant y-ions observed in MS/MS acquired in the DDA mode were employed for MRM monitoring of each peptide.
PMC5050164	R02000	Owing to its relatively high reactivity, the desthiobiotin-C3-ATP probe may react with, apart from the lysine residue(s) located at the ATP-binding site of ATP-binding proteins, lysine residues in other proteins through electrostatic interactions.4,5 Thus, we classified the kinase peptides from the 15 cell lines in our library into two groups on the basis of local amino acid sequences surrounding the probe-labeled lysine, as described previously.8
PMC5050164	R02002	Although the latter group of peptides do not reside in any of the known conserved ATP-binding motifs and their involvement in ATP binding remains to be determined, their high frequencies of identification in shotgun proteomic studies render these peptides suitable candidates for quantifying the corresponding kinases.
PMC5050164	R03000	With the use of the ICAP reagents (Figure 1a), a large portion of protein kinases were labeled on the lysine residues located in the ATP-binding motifs that are highly conserved.
PMC5050164	R03001	As a result, some of the identified desthiobiotin-C3-labeled peptides may be assigned to multiple protein kinases.
PMC5050164	R03002	To avoid ambiguity in kinase quantification with the MRM method, we inspected each identified desthiobiotin-C3-labeled peptide in the MRM kinome library and deleted those that could be attributed to multiple kinases.
PMC5050164	R04000	After combining all unique kinase peptides from the 15 cell lines, the MRM library contains 640 distinct peptides derived from 370 kinases (by using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources),24,25 which cover about 60% of the human kinome.
PMC5050164	R04004	By doing so, we substantially expanded our MRM library to contain 818 unique peptides from 474 distinct human kinases.
PMC5050164	R04005	These include 409 protein kinases, 14 lipid kinases, and 51 other kinases (e.g. nucleoside kinases and carbohydrate kinases, Table S2).
PMC5050164	R04006	Thus, our expanded MRM kinome library has a coverage of approximately 80% of the human kinome which contains a total of 518 protein kinases.12
PMC5050164	R05003	To this end, we calculated the iRT value for each peptide on our target list following a previously published method.9 Based on retention time information of targeted peptides analyzed on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos coupled with EASY-nLC II system, we used 10 BSA peptides as standards and successfully converted empirically determined retention times of 98% (803 out of 818) kinase peptides into normalized iRT scores, which reflect their conserved elution order.
PMC5050164	R06003	With the iRT values of the desthiobiotin-labeled kinase peptides and the existing iRT values of the corresponding desthiobiotin-C3-labeled kinase peptides in the library, a linear relationship in iRT values between the desthiobiotin-labeled peptides and the desthiobiotin-C3-labeled counterparts could be established (Figure S2a, Table S3).
PMC5050164	R07001	It turned out that the MRM-based kinome analysis led to the detection of 470 unique peptides from 313 distinct human kinases in 5 LC-MS/MS runs.
PMC5050164	R07002	On the other hand, the shotgun proteomic approach using online 2D-LC-MS/MS with a 9-step gradient during SCX fractionation only gave rise to the identification of 174 kinases.
PMC5050164	R09000	The results from the MRM-based targeted proteomic method led to the quantification of a total of 328 unique kinases, including 288 protein kinases, 11 lipid kinases and 29 other kinases, which cover approximately 55% of the human kinome (Figure 2 and Table S4).
PMC5050164	R09001	In the viewpoint that approximately 400 protein kinases are expressed in a single cell,14 more than 70% of the expressed protein kinases could be quantified with the MRM-based kinome assay.
PMC5050164	R09004	More than 90% of the quantified kinase peptides displayed a consistent trend in forward and reverse labeling experiments in MRM-based targeted analysis (Table S4, and representative results for EGFR are shown in Figure 3b), demonstrating the excellent performance of this method.
PMC5050164	R10001	In addition, 11 out of 49 perturbed kinases are involved in MAPK pathway, rendering it the major pathway perturbed by MG treatment (Figure S3, Figure 4a).
PMC5050164	R10002	In this vein, the MG-induced alteration of MAPK signaling pathway was reported previously.29,30 Furthermore, 8 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including EPHA2, EPHA4, EGFR, IGF2R, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and NTRK2, were found to be altered upon MG treatment and all of them except FGFR2 were down-regulated (Figure 4b).
PMC5050164	R11001	Thus, we focused on these kinases to explore the mechanisms through which their alterations are induced by MG treatment.
PMC5050164	R12000	We next validated the MRM findings by using Western blot analysis and assessed whether the MG-induced decrease of the three receptor tyrosine kinases could be rescued by pre-incubation of cells with scavengers of α-ketoaldehydes and an antioxidant.
PMC5087317	A00000	Kinase inhibitor resistance often involves upregulation of poorly understood “bypass” signaling pathways.
PMC5087317	A00002	Proteolytic shedding of surface receptors, which can provide negative feedback on signaling activity, is blocked by kinase inhibitor treatment and enhances bypass signaling.
PMC5087317	A00003	In particular, MEK inhibition broadly decreases shedding of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including HER4, MET, and most prominently AXL, an ADAM10 and ADAM17 substrate, thus increasing surface RTK levels and mitogenic signaling.
PMC5087317	A00005	Disrupting protease inhibition by neutralizing TIMP1 improves mitogen-activated-protein-kinase inhibitor efficacy, and combined MAPK/AXL inhibition synergistically reduces tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft models.
PMC5087317	D00003	MEK and PI3K kinase inhibition have been shown to enhance the signaling of sheddase substrates including HER2 (3, 5) and AXL (1, 42), and we show here that inhibition of MEK, BRAF, and to some extent PI3K, p38, and JUN N-terminal kinase (as in Fig.
PMC5087317	D01000	The promiscuous nature of metalloproteinases has made it difficult to anticipate the overall effects of perturbing their activities, especially in response to kinase inhibition (17, 19).
PMC5087317	D01003	Nonetheless, substantial evidence suggests that MEKi inhibits a disintegrin and metalloproteinase catalytic activities themselves (Fig. 7), and we highlight an unappreciated role for TIMP1 association in this context.
PMC5087317	D01006	This work suggests that past metalloproteinase inhibitor clinical trials may have failed partly due to unanticipated compensatory signaling feedback from unshed RTKs.
PMC5087317	D02005	Here we show that kinase inhibition simultaneously increases full-length RTK on the cell surface while decreasing decoy receptor levels in the extracellular supernatant or in circulation.
PMC5087317	D03001	Many RTKs reported as transcriptionally upregulated in response to kinase inhibition are themselves sheddase substrates, including PDGFRβ (1, 8), VEGFR2 (1), and CD44 (47).

PMC5087317	I00002	For example, targeting mitogen-activated-protein-kinase (mitogen-activated-protein-kinase) signaling through MEK or B-RAF inhibition leads to increased transcription of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which then provide alternative pro-growth and pro-survival signals that circumvent the intended inhibitor effects (1–3).
PMC5087317	I01004	More generally, MAPKi carries broad importance given many other relevant drug targets including various RTKs are upstream of the mitogen-activated-protein-kinase pathway and indirectly affect its activity.
PMC5087317	I02000	Relative to tumor gene expression changes, little attention has been paid to how the tumor-derived extracellular proteome changes in response to targeted kinase inhibitors, and how such changes impact bypass signaling and drug efficacy.
PMC5087317	I02001	Of central importance, the ‘A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinases’ (ADAMs) ADAM10 and ADAM17 are widely known as the principal “sheddases” of the cell surface responsible for shedding ectodomains of hundreds of transmembrane substrates, including many growth factors, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and metalloproteinases involved in the processes described above.
PMC5087317	I02004	and ADAM17 are particularly overexpressed in many cancers including breast cancer and melanoma (13, 14), with activities governed by frequently dysregulated mitogen-activated-protein-kinase signaling (10, 15).
PMC5087317	I02007	These failures can largely be attributed to a poor understanding of how the broad activity of ADAMs, and metalloproteinases in general, integrate to influence overall tumor behavior (19).

PMC5087317	I03005	We tested two strategies to enhance MAPKi efficacy: (1) modulating ADAM10 through neutralizing its cognate inhibitor “tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1” (TIMP1), and (2) inhibiting the RTK AXL, a key protease substrate that we observed to be upregulated following MAPKi.
PMC5087317	R00001	However, little is known regarding how extracellular RTK levels change in response to targeted kinase inhibitor treatment, and how such changes influence drug efficacy in cancer.
PMC5087317	R00012	EGFR, which is not a suspected metalloproteinase substrate, behaved in stark contrast to MET and AXL: in the supernatant, EGFR i) did not consistently decrease in response to MEKi (Fig.
PMC5087317	R10009	Notably, cell lines displaying synergistic response were also enriched for RAS mutation, which is possibly related to a decreased reliance on signaling through proteolytically shed EGF-ligands for mitogen-activated-protein-kinase activity, and which is clinically relevant due to the frequent assessment of RAS mutation in patient tumors (Fig.
PMC5087317	R12001	We first took a proteomic approach to look for global patterns in how the tumor-derived extracellular proteome changes in response to targeted kinase inhibitor treatment, using antibody microarrays to screen 1000 proteins for differential supernatant accumulation following MEKi in the TNBC MDA-MB231 cell line.
PMC5087317	R13000	We next compared the supernatant effects of MEKi with broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibition (MPi) using batimastat (BB94), and found similar patterns of widely decreased sheddase substrates amphiregulin (AREG), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HBEGF), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), and AXL following inhibitor treatment (Fig. 4B).
PMC5087317	R13004	p38, PI3K, and c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JUN N-terminal kinase) inhibitors also significantly reduced sheddase-substrate accumulation, consistent with previous reports describing their effects on a disintegrin and metalloproteinase activity (15, 33).
PMC5087317	R14013	Taken together, these data provide further evidence that MEKi effects on RTK processing are highly consistent with reduced proteolysis by metalloproteinases.
PMC5087317	R16014	Compensatory JNK signaling in response to MAPKi leads to a synergistic response to dual JUN N-terminal kinase and mitogen-activated-protein-kinase inhibition (35), and our data suggest that sheddase activity is a key feedback component driving this synergistic interaction.
PMC5087317	R16015	To test this model, we measured the degree of drug synergy as a response to combination MAPKi and JNKi treatment, in the presence or absence of MPi, and found that the degree of synergy between JNKi and MAPKi is strongly reduced in the absence of metalloproteinase activity (Fig.
PMC5087317	R17007	This analysis revealed that synergistic interactions between MEKi and AXLi were substantially reduced in the absence of metalloproteinase activity (Fig.

PMC5191879	I02001	All biomarkers which are currently available, such as 14-3-3, total tau (tau), S-100 calcium-binding protein B (S-100B), alpha-synuclein or neuron specific enolase (neuron specific enolase) and the recently established in vitro amplification assays real time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC), have a relative high accuracy but their sensitivities depending from the PRNP codon 129 MV genotype are ranging between 80-90%, which may result in false negative diagnoses [6–15].
PMC5191879	I03000	In this context, a previous high-throughput two-dimensional proteomic approach on sCJD brain homogenates and CSF in our group indicated a regulation of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1), an enzyme that reversibly catalyses the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate (part of many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle)
PMC5191879	I04002	To estimate the association of MDH1 level with other neurodegenerative marker proteins, we additionally performed a correlation analysis between MDH1 and tau, p-tau, 14-3-3, S-100B, neuron specific enolase, Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42 and the Aβ ratio.

PMC5290984	A00005	By global proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling, we show that, in BL, HSP90 inhibition compromises the activity of the pivotal B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)-proximal effector spleen tyrosine kinase (spleen tyrosine kinase), which we identified as an HSP90 client protein.
PMC5290984	D00000	Our study uncovers a hitherto unknown function for HSP90 in inducing apoptosis of BL cells by disrupting tonic BCR signaling through destabilization of the pivotal BCR transducer kinase spleen tyrosine kinase.
PMC5290984	D01003	Third, we demonstrated the physical interaction between HSP90 and spleen tyrosine kinase and its dependency on the BCR signaling-dependent phosphorylation of HSP90 on Y197.
PMC5290984	D02000	As expected from the broad chaperoning activity of HSP90, BCR effector kinases other than spleen tyrosine kinase, such as LYN, BTK, and AKT, become less stable after HSP90 inhibition.
PMC5290984	D02001	However, although downregulation of AKT might further support the proapoptotic effect of HSP90 inhibitors in some BL cell lines (Figure 1A), LYN and BTK are unlikely to play a major role in this process because neither Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibition nor LYN downregulation by shRNA affected the survival of BL cells.
PMC5290984	D04001	Because HSP90 inhibitors target several important BCR signaling effectors at once, they might also become a valuable tool in the context of kinase inhibitor resistance, which is driven by mutations in the target kinase itself or bypass mechanisms through other cell survival promoting kinases.33-35

PMC5290984	I03001	We observed a strong efficacy of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors and found that HSP90 inhibition leads to apoptosis in BL cells by interfering with spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK)-mediated tonic BCR signaling.
PMC5290984	M09000	spleen tyrosine kinase was immunoprecipitated from 2 × 107 DG75 and Daudi cells using SYK-specific antibodies (clone D3Z1E, Cell Signaling Technology) at a 1:100 dilution, as described previously.17
PMC5290984	R02006	Consistently, a quantitative proteome analysis revealed downregulation of several BCR-proximal kinases including SYK, Src family tyrosine-protein kinase Lyn (LYN), and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) upon HSP90 inhibition (Figure 2C).
PMC5290984	R02009	In addition, spleen tyrosine kinase downregulation was confirmed in vitro after AT13387 treatment of primary BL cells purified from 2 patients with bone marrow involvement (Figure 2E).
PMC5290984	R03000	The effect of HSP90 inhibition on the pivotal BCR-proximal kinases LYN, SYK, and Bruton's tyrosine kinase was furthermore reflected by an attenuated BCR signaling response upon BCR stimulation.
PMC5290984	R03001	BCR-stimulated BL cells showed reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (extracellular signal regulated kinase) and AKT (Figure 3A-B) as well as reduced Ca2+
PMC5290984	R04001	Flow cytometric analysis indicated that HSP90 inhibitors do not affect the expression of the BCR on the plasma membrane (Figure 4A); therefore, we focused on the BCR-proximal kinases that are downregulated upon HSP90 inhibition (Figure 2C).
PMC5290984	R04002	Neither Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibition by the small molecule PCI-32765 (ibrutinib) (median IC50, 7.51 µM; see Figure 1A) nor downregulation of LYN by inducible Lyn-specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (Figure 4B-C) affected BL cell viability.
PMC5290984	R04007	Notably, SYK has not been identified as an HSP90 client in other cell types, including breast cancer cells, where spleen tyrosine kinase acts as a tumor suppressor.24-26
PMC5290984	R05006	Our results, therefore, not only classified SYK as an HSP90 client, but they also identified a BCR signaling-dependent phosphorylation event that is required for the chaperoning of spleen tyrosine kinase in BL cells.
PMC5290984	R06000	The results presented here indicate that the apoptotic effect of HSP90 inhibitors in BL cells is primarily mediated by destabilization of spleen tyrosine kinase.
PMC5290984	R06001	To further confirm this, we introduced a constitutively active TEL-SYK fusion protein in DG75 and Daudi cells.29,30 TEL-SYK expression was not significantly affected by HSP90 inhibition in these BL cell lines (Figure 6A), and it induced phosphorylation of several BCR effector proteins, including CBL, PLCγ2, and Bruton's tyrosine kinase.

PMC5413427	D01004	The EP300 protein (E1A binding protein P300) is encoded by tumor suppressor gene EP300 and is also involved in histone acetyltransferase activity and transcription regulation through chromatin remodeling [24].
PMC5413427	R03001	Three peaks (2886.670, 2939.235, and 3119.317 m/z) out of the four were identified; two (2886.67 and 3119.32 m/z) were histone acetyltransferases and one (2939.24 m/z) was a transporting ATPase subunit.
PMC5415790	A02003	In addition to these changes, in the serum-depleted proteome we observed downregulation of keratin 8, and upregulation of vimentin, the glycolytic enzymes enolase and pyruvate kinase (PKM2) and tumor progression-related inosine-5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase 2 (IMPDH2) enzyme.
PMC5415790	D02001	Furthermore, key proteins related with metabolism – M1/M2 pyruvate kinase and Alpha enolase – and vimentin were found to be differentially expressed under conditions of complete serum depletion but not in 0.5 % FBS culture.
PMC5415790	D04001	Alpha enolase is a multifunctional enzyme that, besides its role in glycolysis, takes part in several processes such as growth control, hypoxia tolerance and transcription repression through binding to the c-myc promoter [23].
PMC5415790	D08004	The main changes include: increased transcription of cytokines, chemokines and growth factors; elevated activity of DNA-repair enzymes, proteases and other degradative enzymes and resistance-related proteins; and changes in adhesion molecules and components of the innate and adaptive immunity [35].
PMC5415790	D10001	However, a proteomic analysis of hypoxia-induced responses on the BeWo choriocarcinoma cell line showed that two proteins involved in the glycolytic pathway (malate dehydrogenase and enolase) were upregulated, while the expression of two cytoskeletal components (keratin 1 and beta-actin) were downregulated [45].

PMC5415790	R06003	Interestingly, and in contrast to the preceding analysis for 0.5 % serum cultures, we found that proteins with important roles in metabolism and phenotype regulation were induced by serum depletion, such as vimentin (VIM), M1/M2 pyruvate kinase (M1/M2 pyruvate kinase), alpha enolase (Alpha enolase) and inosin (IMPDH2).
PMC5415790	R07002	The absence of serum had a profound influence on processes such as glycolysis and cell motility (Fig. 4b), as can be deduced from the differential expression of proteins such as M1/M2 pyruvate kinase, Alpha enolase and vimentin (Table 1, Additional files 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5).
PMC5415790	R08003	With the exception of KRT8, all the identified proteins were connected with a central cluster composed of heat shock proteins, PKM2, Alpha enolase and VCP, as observed in the summary network (Fig. 6a).
PMC5415790	R11000	Serum depletion upregulated proteins, as PKM2, Alpha enolase, IMPDH2, and VIM, are related with cyclin-dependent kinase (cyclin-dependent kinase).

PMC5417820	A00010	Perturbation of this process using marketed receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors revealed dasatinib to severely compromise macrophage differentiation due to an off-target activity.
PMC5417820	D01008	Although internalization of some monocyte markers such as CD4 is very fast, abundances of some receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the ephrin receptors, steadily decrease over the course of 2 days.
PMC5417820	D02007	Sunitinib and imatinib, two other marketed kinase inhibitors, do not elicit this response.
PMC5417820	D02008	Because imatinib and dasatinib were both designed as Abl kinase inhibitors, an off-target activity of dasatinib must be responsible for the impaired differentiation.
PMC5417820	D02010	These data and the known role of ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases in differentiation processes (65) are suggestive for these proteins being the dasatinib off-targets responsible for the observed dysregulation of the differentiation into macrophages.

PMC5417820	M11001	After 48 h of differentiation in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitor, adherent cells were detached with trypsin, and 5 × 104 cells in 100 μl of fresh RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 nm PMA, and 1 μm kinase inhibitor or DMSO were seeded per well in a 96-well microtiter plate.
PMC5417820	M14000	For identification of proteins significantly regulated due to the presence of kinase inhibitor during differentiation, we compared the 48-h time point of normally differentiated cells and cells differentiated in the presence of kinase inhibitors from two biological replicates.
PMC5417820	R00018	Because of the substantially higher coverage achieved and the modest loss in specificity, the PNGase F digestion step was omitted in the following experiments, and analyses were focused on the complete sets of tryptic peptides generated by on-bead proteolysis from individual samples.
PMC5417820	R03005	In the combined dataset, we identified a total of 2431 plasma membrane proteins, including 604 receptors, 307 transporters, 502 enzymes, 768 proteins with other molecular functions such as GTPase activation, developmental protein, cytokine, or chaperone, and 250 proteins with no annotated molecular function (Fig. 1E).
PMC5417820	R07001	For example, the urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor PLAUR was found 28-fold up-regulated, whereas its negative regulator, the c-type mannose receptor MRC2 that controls the extracellular level of PLAUR (54), was 5-fold reduced during differentiation.
PMC5417820	R09001	Among these, 14 kinases were significantly regulated after 24 h during monocyte to macrophage differentiation, including KIT and ephrin receptors EPHA3, EPHA7, and EPHB1 (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig.

PMC5417820	R11002	S5 and supplemental Table S5) (64) suggested that neither Abl kinase inhibition nor any of the other kinases affected by imatinib or sunitinib are responsible for the observed dysregulation of the differentiation program.
PMC5417820	R11003	Ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases are potently inhibited by dasatinib but not by imatinib or sunitinib.
PMC5417820	R11004	Because of the observed regulation of ephrin receptors during macrophage differentiation, and the established role of ephrins for regulation of cell differentiation (65) and regulation of bone homeostasis (66), it seems very likely that off-target inhibition of ephrin kinases by dasatinib caused dysregulated macrophage differentiation.
PMC5420129	A02000	Among proteins upregulated in C4–2 and C4–2B cells than in LNCaP cells, we focused on gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1), a cell-surface enzyme that regulates the catabolism of extracellular glutathione.

PMC5450719	R02000	Despite T. mossambicanus having a more complex venom profile than D. typus, and thus lower relative amounts of P-III snake venom metalloprotease (Supplementary Data), it actually displayed a higher rate of cleavage of a matrix metalloprotease specific substrate (Figure 4).

PMC5498720	D08001	The most prominent protein from the ELISA study was MAP2942c, termed a Mpt53 secreted antigen, which has been annotated as a disulfide oxidoreductase and was previously identified by screening an expression library with sera from a cow in the clinical stage of disease (16).
PMC5498720	D08006	Membrane proteins, fatty acid-coenzyme A (coenzyme A) synthase, and cytochrome c oxidase are among the strongest reactors during subclinical disease.

PMC5516978	A00003	Seven E. cuniculi proteins were identified at one-dimensional gel regions where specific seropositive reaction was observed by Western blot, including polar tube protein 3, polar tube protein 2, and for the first time reported: heat shock related 70kDa protein, polysaccharide deacetylase domain-containing protein, zinc finger protein, spore wall and anchoring disk complex protein EnP1, and translation elongation factor 1 alpha.
PMC5516978	A00005	This included serum paraoxonase, alpha-1-antiproteinase F precursor and alpha-1-antiproteinase S-1 which have presumptive catalytic activity likely related to infection control, and cystatin fetuin-B-type, an enzyme regulator that has been poorly studied to date.
PMC5516978	D01007	Furthermore, we also described polysaccharide deacetylase domain-containing protein is targeted by the immune response perhaps because it acts during the sporogonial stage by protecting the microsporidian chitin layer from hydrolysis by mammalian chitinases.
PMC5516978	D02003	In addition to two proteins of the hemoglobin complex, as well as some others including immunoglobulin gamma-chain C-region and cystatin fetuin B-type, five had putative catalytic activity: alpha-1-antiproteinase precursor, alpha-1-antiproteinase S-1, haptoglobin, serum paraoxonase/arylesterase and ceruloplasmin.
PMC5516978	D02004	The former two both belong to the serine-protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily, also referred to as serum trypsin inhibitors [40].
PMC5516978	D02006	In a previous study, incubation of E. cuniculi spores with trypsin was shown to have impact on their virulence [41], so it may be proposed that the increasing levels of host enzymes of the serpin family, like alpha-1-antiproteinase precursor and alpha-1-antiproteinase, may play a role in the in vivo regulation of the inflammatory response during encephalitozoonosis in rabbits.
PMC5516978	D02007	Paraoxonase is a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) associated with serum enzymes [42].
PMC5516978	D02009	Interestingly, resveratrol, a plant-derived phenolic compound, was previously shown to express an inhibitory action on E. cuniculi, and the paraoxonase was then thought to be involved in its possible pathway of action [44].
PMC5516978	D03004	Likewise, kininogen 1, alpha-2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A-I, and alpha-1-antiproteinase E have also been sporadically reported to be increased in infectious diseases [55], but their concomitant association which appeared specific during neurological clinical signalmen of E. cuniculi active infection is novel in such a context.
PMC5516978	D03008	The detection of increased kininogen 1 in the current study may be the result of a host defense mechanism of generating pro-inflammatory bradykinin-related peptides at the sites of infection, since some virulence factors, like secreted aspartic proteases of pathogens, were shown in an experimental model of candidiasis to induce host kininogen proteolysis.

PMC5516978	R02000	MS successfully identified seven proteins in regions of the Coomassie-blue gel that corresponded to the bands detected in Western blotting (Table 2): heat shock related 70 kDa protein, translation elongation factor 1 alpha, zinc finger protein, polysaccharide deacetylase domain-containing protein, polar tube protein 3, polar tube protein 2, and spore wall and anchoring disk complex protein EnP1, a fragment of which was also found at 19–20 kDa.
PMC5516978	R03003	Five of these proteins have a putative catalytic activity: alpha-1-antiproteinase F precursor, alpha-1-antiproteinase S-1, serum paraoxonase/arylesterase, haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin, while the two latter are also theoretically involved in protein and metal-ion binding, respectively.
PMC5516978	R04003	Four enzyme regulators were increased concomitantly with presence of neurological signs: kininogen I, alpha-2-plasmin serine protease inhibitor, alpha-2-macroglobulin and alpha-1-antiproteinase E.
PMC5516978	R05000	In convalescent individuals with past medical history of E. cuniculi infection, four proteins were significantly upregulated and not observed at these levels in rabbits with current active infection (Fig 1C, Table 5): one intra-Golgi vesicle membrane uncharacterized protein, Ig gamma chain C-region, immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region and nudix hydrolase 11.
PMC5516978	R05001	Furthermore, in the same convalescent subjects, three proteins were all found to be largely decreased in comparison to control rabbits with E. cuniculi-unrelated inflammation and to diseased rabbits with active infection: SET domain bifurcated 2 protein, which is an histone-lysine N-methyltransferase, DEAH (Asp-Glu-Ala-His) box polypeptide 29, which is an ATP-dependent helicase of the 43S ribosomal preinitiation complex in the mitochondria, and keratin 1, which is a structural protein also involved in negative regulation of inflammatory response and in complement activation through the lectin pathway.

PMC5585134	D00001	Interestingly, two of the proteins that correlated to high levels of LDL, integrin alpha-M and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD), have been associated with inflammation.
PMC5585134	D00002	This is congruent with proteomic analysis of atherosclerotic plaques that have also found elevated levels of mitochondrial superoxide dismutase in unstable plaques (7).
PMC5585134	R00008	Serum LDL levels correlated with Septin-2 (rs = 0.78, p = 0.028), Phosphoglycerate Kinase 1 (rs = 0.75, p = 0.036), Integrin Alpha-M (rs = 0.68, p = 0.033) and Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (rs = 0.63, p = 0.05) (Table ​(Table2).2).
PMC5624401	A00003	We identified new candidates from a TBI CSF proteome by selecting trauma-released, astrocyte-enriched proteins including aldolase C (ALDOC), its 38kD breakdown product (BDP), brain lipid binding protein (BLBP), astrocytic phosphoprotein (PEA15), glutamine synthetase (glutamine synthetase) and new 18-25kD-GFAP-BDPs.
PMC5624401	D06000	Astrocytes maintain high rates of active oxidative glucose metabolism, express high levels of glycolytic and tricarboxyl acid cycle enzymes and carry many mitochondria.26,31 glutamine synthetase and BLBP have vital roles in glutamate recycling and fatty acid uptake at the tripartite synapse.73,74 ALDOC provides the substrate for lactate and ATP production and its product glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate controls cell fate and astrocyte-neuron crosstalk.75 PEA15 regulates glucose metabolism, provides resistance to glucose deprivation and adapts cells to changing metabolic states.76,77 Astrocytes can regulate neuronal metabolic supply by adjusting local blood flow on demand because they ensheath synapses as well as capillaries.74,78 Thus, astroglial metabolism is essential for maintaining neuro-metabolic coupling and brain energy homeostasis.

PMC5624401	I02000	Many studies have been conducted to identify new neurotrauma protein biomarker candidates.15,16 GFAP, neuron specific enolase, neurofilaments, tau, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCHL1) and S100 β have been previously chosen for their neuropathological presence.
PMC5624401	R00004	To further improve specificity, we determined astrocyte-enriched proteins using published gene array data and excluded proteins found in plasma from healthy individuals or are abundant outside the CNS.31,41–44 From this, four astroglial injury-associated proteins were identified: (1) aldolase C (ALDOC), which is exceptional, both in astrocyte enrichment and abundance among brain proteins,30,45 (2) glutamine synthetase (GS, also known as GLNA), (3) brain lipid binding protein (BLBP, also known as brain fatty acid binding protein, FABP7) and (4) astrocytic phosphoprotein 15 (PEA15).
PMC5624401	R01006	The abundant CSF protein prostaglandin synthase (PTGDS) served as a CSF standard.
PMC5624401	R01008	ALDOC and glutamine synthetase were persistently elevated up to five days post injury, while GFAP and S100 β decreased on the second post-injury day.
PMC5624401	R01012	The CSF from a control subject had high levels of PTGDS, whereas prostaglandin synthase was not detected on injury day and its levels recovered over subsequent days in the CSF of a TBI patient (Figure 1(a)).
PMC5624401	R02005	glutamine synthetase and BLBP varied more between TBI patients, yet also without significant mean decreases on later post-injury days (Figure 1(g) to (​(h)).h)).
PMC5624401	R02009	Preliminary analysis of this cohort shows that mean prostaglandin synthase levels recovered in TBI survivors, while levels declined further in nonsurvivors (Supplementary Figure S4(a)).
PMC5624401	R04006	Injury day CSF levels were highest for ALDOC with GFAP next in order, while BLBP and glutamine synthetase levels were significantly lower (Figure 2(d)).
PMC5624401	R05001	BLBP and PEA15 correlated robustly with each other as did ALDOC and glutamine synthetase, indicating similar kinetics between these marker pairs.
PMC5624401	R05003	Astroglial biomarker levels correlated negatively with prostaglandin synthase, representing injured versus healthy conditions.
PMC5624401	R06001	This unsupervised analysis grouped nine neurotrauma markers into two factors, with CSF standard prostaglandin synthase resulting in a third factor.
PMC5624401	R06003	Factor A comprised GFAP, its lower BDPs, S100 β and APOB, while Factor B contained ALDOC, its 38kD fragment, BLBP, glutamine synthetase, and PEA15 (Figure 3(a)).
PMC5625392	A00005	A naive Bayes classifier using six host response markers (HR6 model), including SYWC, kallistatin, complement C9, gelsolin, testican-2, and aldolase C, performed well in a training set (area under the sensitivity-specificity curve [AUC] of 0.94) and in a blinded verification set (AUC of 0.92) to distinguish TB and non-TB samples.
PMC5625392	A00007	Proteins with the largest median fold changes were SAA (serum amyloid protein A), NPS-PLA2 (secreted phospholipase A2), and CA6 (carbonic anhydrase 6).
PMC5625392	D01001	The biologic categories of the markers encompass immunity and host defense (C9, FCG3B, cathelicidin, LBP, and FCRL1), vascular remodeling (kallistatin and TSP4), extracellular matrix and tissue remodeling (gelsolin, COMP, lumican, testican-2, and CD36 antigen), lipid transport and regulation (phospholipases), coagulation and complement (C1QT1), proteases (MMP-1, MMP-2, CNDP1, and BMP-1), and bacterial recognition (PGRP-L).

PMC5625392	R02003	Many new markers were discovered among the larger proteomic content of the 4,000-plex SOMAscan version compared to the 1,129-plex scan used in phase I, including SYWC, MED-1, FCN1, B4GT6, PGRP-L, CD36 antigen, PTGD2, sPLA(2)-XIII, biotinidase, lumican, α1-antitrypsin, FGL1, BMP-1, CD109, cathelicidin, and aldolase C.
PMC5625392	R03000	A new top marker more abundant in TB than non-TB samples was SYWC, a gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-inducible Trp-tRNA-synthetase associated with stress response.
PMC5625392	R04009	This optimal model contained 6 host response proteins (HR6 model): SYWC, kallistatin, C9, gelsolin, testican-2, and aldolase C. Four of the six biomarkers had been part of the previous HR9 model from phase I, and SYWC and aldolase C were discovered in the larger, 4,000-plex SOMAscan used in phase II and provided additional sensitivity and specificity to the model.

PMC5635279	D02000	One of the explanation of the CA II, ASA interaction, observed in this study may be a hypothesis that by adjusting of the cytosolic pH [22], the CA II affects the acetylating of platelet cyclooxygenase by aspirin which could in turn determine their response to the ASA.

PMC5826843	R05006	Notably, higher amounts of myeloperoxidase were observed in spontaneous NETs isolated from patients with AAV or SLE.
PMC5826843	R06000	When comparing NET contents in patients with AAV versus SLE, there was a significantly greater amount of lactoferrin, H2A, S100A8, and S100A9 in NETs from unstimulated neutrophils in SLE and significantly greater myeloperoxidase, H2b, H4, and S100A12 in NETs from unstimulated neutrophils in AAV.

PMC5830394	M06000	Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed as previously described.12 Values were normalized using S18 and HPRT as a reference gene and calibrated relative to expression of CD14+ monocytes at day 0 (primers listed in Online Supplementary Methods).

PMC5833473	R06000	Previously, we have shown that control neutrophils during 20 min of adhesion to fibronectin secreted lactoferrin (LF), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), lysozyme, and myeloperoxidase (MPO), as well as albumin and cytosolic S100A8 and S100A9 proteins [40, 41].
PMC5833473	R06003	Nevertheless, LF and NGAL are considered components of the secondary granules, myeloperoxidase is contained mainly in the primary granules, and albumin belongs to secretory vesicles.
PMC5833473	R07000	When neutrophils adhere to fibronectin in the presence of E2, they release the same proteins as the control cells (LF, albumin, NGAL, S100A8, and S100A9) and, in addition, metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) (Figure 3(a), Table 2).
PMC5833473	R07001	MMP-9 is localized presumably in the tertiary or gelatinase granules of neutrophils [43].
PMC5833473	R07002	Metalloproteinases are involved in the adhesion and migration of neutrophils because of their ability to modulate the extracellular matrix and remove the barriers of the basement membranes [44].
PMC5833473	R08000	Neutrophils that adhered to fibronectin in the presence of insulin secreted the same proteins as the control cells and, in addition, MMP-9 and matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP-8) (Figure 3(b); Table 2).
PMC5833473	R08001	MMP-8, or neutrophil collagenase, is involved in degradation of all structural components of extracellular matrix and plays a crucial role in many physiological processes including inflammatory and cardiovascular disorders [46].
PMC5833473	R11001	Cathepsin G is one of the three serine proteases (along with proteinase-3 and elastase) that are contained in primary (azurophil) granules of neutrophils and involved in clearance of internalized pathogens, proteolytic modification of chemokines and cytokines, and shedding of cell surface receptors [55].
PMC5833473	R14004	Insulin and E2 can alter the adhesion of neutrophils initiating the secretion of metalloproteinase, which modifies extracellular matrix proteins.
PMC5853081	A02002	The resulting digestion pattern differed from that brought about by kallikrein, a host serine protease that normally acts on HK to release the vasodilator bradykinin.
PMC5853081	A03000	Since proteomic and biochemical studies have revealed that the schistosome tegument contains two cysteine proteases belonging to the calpain family (SmCalp1 and SmCalp2) we conclude that these are likely responsible for the HK cleavage reported here.
PMC5853081	D04012	Whether further cleavage of the schistosome-generated HK fragments by host proteases leads to the eventual release of bradykinin is not known.
PMC5853081	D04013	One caveat arises from the report that an S. mansoni prolyl oligopeptidase (SmPOP) can degrade bradykinin [22].
PMC5853081	D04016	These data leave open the unlikely possibility that schistosomes can generate bradykinin, but it is rapidly broken down via Schistosome mansoni prolyl oligopeptidase.
PMC5853081	D07001	Since the host HK cleaving enzyme kallikrein is a serine protease, we first set out to determine if the worms also possessed surface serine proteases that might be responsible for HK cleavage.
PMC5853081	D07005	This result is also consistent with tegumental proteomic work which places cysteine proteases belonging to the calpain family in the parasite surface membranes but no serine proteases there [24, 25].
PMC5853081	D07006	Calpains are calcium-dependent cysteine proteases that engage in limited cleavage of their target proteins [33–35].

PMC5853614	R02001	In this cholera-endemic area, measurable plasma antibody responses to FlaC, FlaD, and sialidase were present in healthy individuals.
PMC5853614	R03001	Mucosal ALS IgG immunoreactivity was significant for sialidase; however, in this small cohort, mucosal ALS IgA responses to sialidase and IgG and IgA responses to FlaC did not reach statistical significance (Figure 4B and ​and4D4D).
PMC5853614	R04001	Significant BMEM ALS IgG responses were seen at day 30 to HlyA, sialidase, and FlaC. For BMEM ALS IgA responses, only HlyA and FlaC reached statistical significance; however, a trend toward statistical significance was observed for sialidase (P = .0640)

PMC5916823	A00001	Escudero et al. report that the MCL-1 BH3 α-helix directly binds to and modulates very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, revealing a new role for MCL-1 in regulating lipid metabolism.
PMC5916823	D00006	With the identification of glucokinase (Danial et al., 2003; Danial et al., 2008) and now very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase as metabolic enzymes subject to regulation by the pro-apoptotic BH3 domain of BAD and anti-apoptotic BH3 domain of MCL-1, respectively, a biological theme of BCL-2 family proteins functioning at the crossroads of mitochondrial apoptosis and metabolism is emerging.
PMC5916823	D01005	Indeed, the corroboration between MCL-1 SAHBD and expressed full-length MCL-1 protein, and MCL-1Matrix in particular, in engaging very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase indicates that stapled peptide helices can serve as high-fidelity proteomic tools to uncover and catalog the protein targets of structured interaction motifs.
PMC5916823	D02011	Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the phenotypic overlap in mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac pathology observed for VLCAD and MCL-1 deficiencies may be driven, at least in part, by a role for MCL-1Matrix in tuning very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity.
PMC5916823	D03010	Whereas small-molecule inhibitors of the MCL-1 groove effectively neutralize its pathologic anti-apoptotic functionality in cancer, targeting the distinct interaction between MCL-1Matrix and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase may provide a therapeutic opportunity to disrupt cancer metabolism by deregulating long-chain fatty acid β-oxidation.

PMC5916823	I03001	Here, we discovered that the MCL-1 BH3 α-helix directly interacts with very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase), a key enzyme of the mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, revealing a functional role for MCL-1 in the dynamic regulation of lipid metabolism.
PMC5916823	M01006	Mcl1Matrix is a fusion construct where the N-terminal 50 amino acids of Neurospora crasa ATP synthase is fused to the N-terminus of Mcl-1ΔN (deletion of the first 67 amino acids of MCL-1).
PMC5916823	M06005	Streptavidin capture using recombinant proteins (see below) was performed with 5 nmol SAHB and 10 pmol protein in a volume of 500 μL. Streptavidin capture using recombinant VLCAD in the presence of palmitoyl-CoA (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# P9716) or hexanoyl-CoA (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# H2012) was performed with 7.2 μM very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 14.4 μM SAHB, and either 0, 18, 36, or 72 μM acyl-CoA in a final volume of 500 μL. Densitometry analyses were performed using ImageJ software.
PMC5916823	M09001	The His-tagged VLCAD construct was expressed in BL21(DE3) E.coli (Invitrogen, Cat# C600003) at 37°C and, upon reaching an optical density (O.D.) of 0.8, bacteria were induced with 0.5 mM isopropylthio-β-galactosidase (IPTG) (Gold Biotechnology, Cat# I2481C) for 4 hours.
PMC5916823	M09005	Protein identification and purity was confirmed by intact mass spectrometry, SDS-PAGE, and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase western blot analysis.
PMC5916823	M10000	Human VLCADΔEx3, a naturally-occurring splice variant of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase that affords robust recombinant expression (Goetzman et al., 2007) (NCBI: NP_001029031.1), was generated by deleting residues 47–68 from the full-length construct described above using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (New England Biolabs, Cat# 23225).
PMC5916823	M12000	Fluorinated SAHB (25 μM) and VLCAD (0–125 μM) were mixed in very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase FPLC buffer containing 10% (v/v) D2O to a final volume of 500
PMC5916823	M13002	The sensors were then transferred into serial dilutions (starting at 30 μM) of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase for 1800 sec.
PMC5916823	M14004	To remove uncrosslinked very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase peptides, the beads were then washed at room temperature three times each in 1% (v/v) SDS in PBS, 1 M NaCl in PBS, and 10% (v/v) ethanol in PBS.
PMC5916823	M15001	The sequence was docked to the crystal structure of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (PDB: 3B96) using the HADDOCK 2.2 webserver default parameters (van Zundert et al., 2016).
PMC5916823	M20002	The reaction was initiated by addition of purified recombinant very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein (final concentration of 0.72 μM) that had been incubated overnight at 4°C with either vehicle (1.5% [v/v] DMSO) or MCL-1 SAHB (final concentration of 72 μM).
PMC5916823	R00006	Of the 49 candidates that met our high stringency criteria, only one was a matrix-resident protein, namely very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which demonstrated an average spectral count of 27 in MCL-1 SAHBD pull-downs compared to 0 for the corresponding vehicle control samples, and 49% sequence coverage (Figure 1C, Table S2).
PMC5916823	R01003	We further found that MCL-1 SAHBD selectively bound to VLCAD but not to other members of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family, such as MCAD and SCAD (Figures 1E, S1F–G).
PMC5916823	R01005	This selective very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase interaction profile, obtained using MCL-1 protein and MCL-1 SAHBD, further validated the fidelity of a stapled peptide α-helix as a proteomic discovery tool.
PMC5916823	R02003	As a measure of binding specificity, an MCL-1 SAHB bearing a staple in the “B” position (flanking residues T-L-R in MCL-1), which was found to disrupt the interaction with very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase but not MCL-1 in streptavidin pull-downs from MEF lysates (Figure S2), recapitulated this selective binding profile in both 19F-NMR and BLI analyses (Figures 2C–F, S3).
PMC5916823	R03003	Most striking, the series of disruptive mutations for each target defined partially overlapping binding interfaces that were shifted from one another by approximately 90 degrees (Figures 3A–B), revealing a distinct mode for MCL-1 BH3 interaction with very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.
PMC5916823	R04004	Using the identified crosslinks as constraints for computational docking, the MCL-1 BH3 motif is predicted to engage very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase by a helix-in-groove interaction that is analogous to the interaction paradigm for BH3 helices with BCL-2 family anti-apoptotic pockets (Sattler et al., 1997; Stewart et al., 2010) (Figure 4B).
PMC5916823	R05003	Here, we observed protection of peptide fragments encompassing residues 431–489 of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase upon MCL-1 SAHB interaction (Figure 4C–D).
PMC5916823	R06003	The results were strikingly similar, indicating that an acute or chronic absence of MCL-1 leads to elevation of the very substrate precursors of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Figure 5B).
PMC5916823	R07006	Taken together, the acylcarnitine and proteomic data point to a specific role for MCL-1Matrix in regulating fatty acid β-oxidation through very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase interaction.
PMC5916823	R08000	Whereas the acylcarnitine data pointed to a role for MCL-1Matrix in regulating fatty acid β-oxidation, the observed elevations could reflect either accumulation from impaired very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity or enhanced mobilization due to increased flux through the pathway.
PMC5916823	R09002	Since loss-of-function mutation of the MCL-1 groove did not alter the mitochondrial phenotype associated with MCL-1Matrix in reconstituted cells (Perciavalle et al., 2012), and the interaction between the hydrophobic face of MCL-1 BH3 and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Figures 3–4) implies an altered MCL-1 conformation, we hypothesized that S63845 would have no effect on long-chain fatty acid oxidation.
PMC5916823	R10004	Streptavidin pull-downs of biotinylated MCL-1 SAHBD upon palmitoyl-CoA titration yielded a striking increase in very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase co-precipitation that directly correlated with palmitoyl-CoA level, as monitored by electrophoresis and Coomassie stain (Figure 6I).
PMC5916823	R11004	Taken together, these data suggest that the MCL-1 BH3 helix can directly modulate the enzymatic activity of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, with the observed in vitro suppressive effect consistent with the heightened activity of long-chain fatty acid oxidation observed in MEFs upon selective elimination of the mitochondrial matrix isoform of MCL-1.
PMC5959920	A00003	Herein we have used serine protease-targeted activity-based probes (ABPs) coupled with mass spectral analysis to identify active forms of proteases secreted by the colonic mucosa of healthy controls and IBD patients.
PMC5959920	A00004	Profiling of (Pro-Lys)-ABP bound proteases revealed that most of hyperactive proteases from IBD secretome are clustered at 28-kDa.
PMC5959920	A00005	We identified seven active proteases: the serine proteases cathepsin G, plasma kallikrein, plasmin, tryptase, chymotrypsin-like elastase 3 A, and thrombin and the aminopeptidase B. Only cathepsin G and thrombin were overactive in supernatants from IBD patient tissues compared to healthy controls.
PMC5959920	A00007	The functional ABP-targeted proteomic approach that we have used to identify active proteases in human colonic samples bears directly on the understanding of the role these enzymes may play in the pathophysiology of IBD.
PMC5959920	D00005	Herein, we used a biotinylated ABP capable of interacting with lysine-cleaving proteases (biotin-PK-DPP), a catalytic feature of most serine proteases and some proteases from other classes21.
PMC5959920	D00006	Furthermore, experiments performed with increasing amounts of active trypsin clearly demonstrated that the signal intensity generated by this ABP augmented accordingly, thus highlighting that this probe can unveil varying activity levels of lysine-cleaving proteases.
PMC5959920	D00008	Because streptavidin which is used to reveal biotinylated bands, can bind non-specifically to proteins22,23, and because we cannot fully exclude that ABP might bind non-specifically to some proteins in a complex mixture, the use of inhibitory AEBSF pre-treatment in counterpart samples was instrumental at discriminating active protease bands.
PMC5959920	D01000	In previous work using activity-based probes to identify active serine proteases associated with intestinal inflammation in an infectious model of rodent colitis, we established a role for host serine proteases and their signalling target, protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), in driving the inflammatory response14.
PMC5959920	D01003	Our main finding is that compared with non-diseased tissues, serine protease-targeted activity-based probes reveal a distinct set of active serine proteases secreted by colonic tissues derived from individuals with either Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis.
PMC5959920	D02004	While from protein or mRNA expression studies, tryptase could appear as a potential molecular target for IBD, our results suggest on the contrary that active tryptase is not present in patient’s tissues.
PMC5959920	D04000	The expression of all serine proteases identified by ABP labelling, namely thrombin, cathepsin G, plasma kallikrein, plasmin, tryptase and chymotrypsin-like elastase family member 3 A, were also found as mRNA transcripts in extracts of colon biopsy tissue (Table 1 and Fig.
PMC5959920	D06000	Surprisingly, one protease from a class other than serine protease was identified as active in samples from UC patients: the metallopeptidase aminopeptidase B.
PMC5959920	D06001	This enzyme is known to display endopeptidase activity after an Arg or a Lys residue28 and this could explain the fact that it binds to the ABP we have used here.
PMC5959920	D06002	To the best of our knowledge, the role of aminopeptidase B in IBD pathophysiology has not been evaluated yet.
PMC5959920	D07000	In summary, the functional proteomic approach employed herein allowed for the identification of a consistent proteomic profile of active serine proteases secreted by the colonic mucosa of healthy and IBD patients.
PMC5959920	D07005	The approach proposed here can be applied to other diseases and other tissues, in order to identify active secreted proteases that may play roles in other inflammatory diseases, so as to serve as potential new therapeutic targets.

PMC5959920	I00001	Among them, one of the largest classes is represented by 184 genes encoding serine proteases, which are characterized by the presence of a nucleophilic serine in their reactive site1.
PMC5959920	I00002	Since the hydrolysis of peptide bonds is an irreversible process, the expression and activity of proteases are tightly regulated.
PMC5959920	I01000	Proteases are essential mediators in gastrointestinal physiology, being produced and released by the pancreas, in order to be activated in the intestinal lumen for digestive purposes.
PMC5959920	I02000	The identity of overactive serine proteases in intestinal tissues remains elusive.
PMC5959920	I02003	Thus, gene and protein expressions of several proteases released primarily by leukocytes (including neutrophil elastase, proteinase-3, cathepsin G, tryptase, chymase or granzymes) have been found to be upregulated in IBD2.
PMC5959920	I02004	Additionally, genetic studies have supported an association of protease genes with IBD risk7,8.
PMC5959920	I02005	Nevertheless, the major limitations of such studies based on expression analysis are due to the fact that mRNA or protein levels for proteases do not necessarily reflect their activity status.
PMC5959920	I03000	Therefore, the identity and implication of proteases in health and diseases, including IBD, have to come from studies investigating the in situ net activity of these enzymes9.
PMC5959920	I04003	Obviously, detection of active proteases is dependent on their affinity towards the ABP that is used.
PMC5959920	I04005	Here, we performed a study to profile and identify active serine proteases secreted by the colonic mucosa of control and IBD patients by using ABPs.
PMC5959920	M04006	The bands corresponding to active proteases were identified by their sensitivity to AEBSF.
PMC5959920	M05004	The pellets containing the ABP-protease complexes adsorbed to the magnetic beads were washed twice with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and then suspended in 6 M urea and 25 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich).
PMC5959920	M08003	A potential active protease was selected based on an enrichment ratio >2 (Intensity AEBSF not treated vs. treated) and a Student’s t-test P-value < 0.05 over the triplicates.
PMC5959920	M09003	Resulting cDNA samples were amplified by conventional PCR with Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, USA) and sequence-specific primer pairs (Supplementary Table 1).
PMC5959920	R01002	Since ABPs react only with active enzymes, the bands corresponding to proteases were discriminated from non-specific labelling by pre-incubating the samples in parallel with the serine protease inhibitor, AEBSF.
PMC5959920	R01004	As a whole, bands representing putative serine proteases ranged from 12 to 250 kDa (Fig. 3A).
PMC5959920	R01005	A distribution analysis of putative proteases according to their molecular weight regrouped them in 10 main clusters, with mean molecular weights of 15, 24, 28, 32, 36, 68, 100, 126, 140 and 250 kDa.
PMC5959920	R01006	The majority of serine proteases were grouped into the 28, 32 and 36 kDa clusters (Fig.
PMC5959920	R04003	This group of identified active proteases includes thrombin, cathepsin G, kallikrein-1 (also named plasma kallikrein), plasmin, chymotrypsin-like elastase family member 3A and tryptase.
PMC5959920	R04004	Additionally, aminopeptidase B (also called arginyl aminopeptidase), a lysine-cleaving protease from the M01 family was also identified as active.
PMC5959920	R04006	Similarly, aminopeptidase B was highly active specifically in association with UC (Table 1).
PMC5959920	R05001	RT-PCR products were detected for the 7 proteases, wherein amplicons with expected base pair numbers were amplified from colonic mucosa (Fig. ​(Fig.44).
PMC5983154	A03000	We observed a correlation between the synthetic rates of skeletal muscle‐derived proteins obtained in serum (creatine kinase M‐type, carbonic anhydrase 3) and the synthetic rates of proteins obtained via muscle sampling; and that the synthesis rates of these proteins in serum revealed the stimulatory effects of RT.
PMC5983154	A05006	The synthetic rates of 175 of 190 contractile, cytosolic and mitochondrial skeletal muscle proteins, as well as synthesis of muscle‐derived proteins measured in serum, creatine kinase M‐type (CK‐M) and carbonic anhydrase 3 (CA‐3), were higher during ER + RT than during ER (P < 0.05).
PMC5983154	I01008	We have recently extended this approach to measure the synthetic rate of skeletal muscle‐synthesized proteins that escape into circulation such as creatine kinase M‐type (CK‐M) and carbonic anhydrase (CA‐3) (Shankaran et al. 2016a).
PMC6002243	D03005	Tubulins mainly play their physiological roles in cellular structure maintenance, GTPase activity and intracellular movement as components of cytoskeleton [21].
PMC6002243	R00003	These potential autoantigens could be divided into different groups below, based on their function: immune response (V3-4 protein, anti-streptococcal/anti-myosin immunoglobulin lambda light chain variable region, lysozyme C); cell mobility, structure, or cell integrity (Cingulin, BAG family molecular chaperone regulator 3 (BAG3), tubulin alpha-1C); lipid transportation (isoform 2 of cholesteryl ester transfer protein, apolipoprotein L1 isoform c precursor),regulation of transcription (zinc finger protein 669, α-enolase); extracellular matrix integrity (Isoform E of Proteoglycan 4), intracellular signal transduction (Serine/threonine-protein kinase TAO3 (TAOK3), retinal guanylyl cyclase 1) and the coagulation cascade (Vitamin K-dependent protein S, protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor, Kininogen-1).
PMC6002243	R00005	Among these proteins, α-enolase has been previously proved to be an autoantigen of BD [8], and autoantibodies againstα-enolase were identified as components of anti-endothelial cell antibody (AECA).
PMC6002243	R00006	Since AECA was a diagnostic biomarker commonly applied for BD and other vasculitis [8], the identification ofα-enolase supported the feasibility of proteomic screening on CICs for BD diagnostic biomarkers in our study.

PMC6046383	A00005	The serine proteases, particularly thrombin, were also found to interact with DNA and bound to NETs in vitro.
PMC6046383	A00007	We observed reduced histone (H2B, H3, and H4) and neutrophil elastase levels upon the addition of the two proteases.
PMC6046383	A00008	Analyses of NET-derived tryptic peptides identified subtle changes upon protease treatments.
PMC6046383	A00009	Our results provide evidence that exogenous proteases, present during wounding and inflammation, influence the NETome.
PMC6046383	D00000	Here, we report for the first time that exogenous proteases such as thrombin and plasmin can alter the proteome of NETs.
PMC6046383	D01000	Studies on the proteome of NETs have used nucleases at varying concentrations (5–20 U/ml) and incubation durations (10–40 min) (6, 7, 20, 21).
PMC6046383	D01007	(6) only, such as histone H1 and catalase, respectively (Table ​(Table1).1).
PMC6046383	D02007	In this respect, it is interesting to note that thrombin and plasmin, like ELANE, belongs to the vast family of S1 peptidases, sharing an overall similar structure and folding (35).
PMC6046383	D03005	On a separate note, it was also interesting that the H4 peptide (V61→K78) was missing in the thrombin- and plasmin-treated NETs, which may indicate that the proteases targeted this region (Figure ​(Figure55C).
PMC6046383	D04001	Therefore, to focus on the concept that proteases may influence the proteome of pre-formed NETs, we selected PMA as the standard NET-inducing agent.
PMC6046383	D05006	Therefore, these evidences imply that exogenous proteases, such as thrombin or plasmin, can modulate NET effects in various physiological contexts.
PMC6046383	D06000	Interestingly, NET-associated ELANE was also reduced in the presence of thrombin and plasmin, and several tryptic peptides, present in the untreated samples, were not detected after subjection to the two proteases (Figure ​(Figure6;6; Table S1 in Supplementary Material).

PMC6046383	I02002	With this as background, we hypothesized that these two serine proteases may alter the proteome of NETs.
PMC6046383	R00002	The experiments were performed in the absence of serum to exclude potential influences from other serum proteases.
PMC6046383	R03000	The two S1 peptidases thrombin and plasmin have been reported to interact with DNA aptamers (17) and short oligos (18).
PMC6046383	R03004	To investigate whether the two proteases interact with DNA, thrombin and plasmin were incubated with purified PMN DNA and analyzed by a gel mobility shift assay.
PMC6046383	R05000	As thrombin and plasmin are proteases, we explored whether their proteolytic activities resulted in the observed reduction of histone levels.
PMC6046383	R05002	We observed that the three types of histones were indeed degraded in the presence of the two proteases (Figure ​(Figure4F),4F), which was in agreement with the immunoblot results (Figure ​(Figure4E).4E).
PMC6046383	R07001	Correspondingly, western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies against ELANE showed that it was reduced on NETs following treatments with the proteases (Figure ​(Figure6B).6B).
PMC6046383	R07004	These results may explain the observation that ELANE staining was significantly reduced by the two proteases as detected by western blotting (Figure ​(Figure66B).

PMC6379952	A00000	A promising arsenal of histone deacetylase (HDAC)-targeted treatment has emerged in the past decade, as the abnormal targeting or retention of HDACs to DNA regulatory regions often occurs in many cancers.

PMC6389127	A00002	Prior work established a sufficient role for glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in enhancing human BNB biophysical properties following serum withdrawal in vitro via RET-tyrosine kinase-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling.
PMC6389127	A00004	Proteomic studies suggested expression of several mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in confluent GDNF-treated endoneurial endothelial cells following serum withdrawal.
PMC6389127	A00005	Using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing to continuously measure transendothelial electrical resistance and static transwell solute permeability assays with fluoresceinated small and large molecules to evaluate BNB biophysical function, we determined mitogen activated protein kinase signaling was essential for GDNF-mediated BNB TEER increase following serum withdrawal downstream of RET-tyrosine kinase signaling that persisted for up to 48 hours in vitro.
PMC6389127	D00000	Using well-established assays of endothelial barrier function, this study demonstrates the role of intracellular mitogen activated protein kinase signaling in GDNF-mediated enhancement of human BNB function following serum withdrawal in vitro, and also confirms that GDNF signals through RET-tyrosine kinase during this process.
PMC6389127	D03000	Endothelial cells are serum-dependent for attachment, and serum withdrawal is associated with diffuse reduction in continuous intercellular membrane contacts in sub-confluent proliferating cells.46 However, serum withdrawal is also a well-established technique to suppress growth, induce contact-inhibition and promote intercellular junction formation by confluent epithelial and endothelial cells in vitro.50-52 The effect of GDNF, RET-tyrosine kinase and mitogen activated protein kinase signaling in maintaining a high TEER following serum withdrawal was confirmed at the human BNB in vitro.
PMC6389127	D04002	There is also evidence that GDNF (secreted by enteric glial cells) regulates the intestinal epithelial barrier in vitro and in vivo, with a potential role in barrier maturation (via p38 mitogen activated protein kinase pathway), wound healing (via cyclic AMP/protein kinase A pathway) and in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.25-28
PMC6389127	D08002	Identifying and studying specific proteins such as TLN1 and CTNNA1, and the signaling pathways downstream of mitogen activated protein kinase signaling associated with transcription control of essential cytoskeletal and junctional complex genes, mechanisms of cytoskeletal remodeling and protein translocation from the cytosol to intercellular membranes, regulation of cell polarity and intercellular junction complex formation may provide targets for future therapeutic modulation to restore physiological BNB function in adult human peripheral nerves in different disease states.

PMC6389127	I01000	GDNF, a related member of the transforming growth factor β protein superfamily, supports the survival of peripheral autonomic and sensory, spinal cord motor and midbrain dopaminergic neurons.8-12 GDNF typically signals via its glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored protein receptor, GFRα1, complexed with “rearranged during transfection” (RET)-tyrosine kinase as part of a multicomponent receptor complex, and utilizes intracellular Ras-mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/AKT, p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathways for its biological effects.11,13-17 Primary human endoneurial endothelial cells (pHEndECs) that form the BNB express GFRα1 in vitro and in situ.7,18-20 Our prior work demonstrated that GDNF is a sufficient paracrine human BNB regulator following serum withdrawal in vitro.19
PMC6389127	I02000	GDNF (in a dose-dependent manner) induced restrictive human BNB properties dependent on RET-tyrosine kinase signaling pathways via histologically-observed cytoskeletal reorganization (i.e. translocation of F-actin cytoskeletal filaments from the cytoplasm to cell membranes) that resulted in more continuous intercellular contacts.
PMC6389127	I02001	This occurred without significantly upregulating known adaptor, adherens and tight junction-associated protein expression, or modulating claudin-5 phosphorylation in vitro, and was independent of cyclic AMP/protein kinase A signaling.19 That study also suggested a role for hyperactivated MAPK signaling in GDNF-mediated human BNB recovery when combined with other less efficacious mitogens (in an attempt to mimic in vivo conditions), with published preliminary data further supporting a direct role of mitogen activated protein kinase signaling in GDNF-mediated restoration of human BNB electrical resistance.21
PMC6389127	I03001	In order to ascertain the signaling pathways by which GDNF enhances human BNB function in vitro following serum withdrawal downstream of RET-tyrosine kinase, we performed electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) to continuously monitor impedance, TEER and capacitance,29 and transwell solute permeability assays to fluoresceinated low and high molecular weight molecules using specific cell permeable signaling pathway inhibitors, guided by proteomic data derived from GDNF-treated pHEndECs following serum withdrawal in vitro, with appropriate controls.
PMC6389127	I03002	To more comprehensively ascertain potential molecular determinants of the intercellular junctional complex responsible for the previously ascertained GDNF-mediated effect on the restrictive human in vitro BNB, we performed human adherens junction and tight junction quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays, quantitative proteomics of cytosolic and membrane protein extracts and fluorescent indirect immunocytochemistry on confluent pHEndEC cultures 48 hours following serum withdrawal with and without added GDNF.
PMC6389127	R01001	These data imply that downstream mitogen activated protein kinase signaling may be relevant to the observed and previously published GDNF-mediated pHEndEC cytoskeletal modifications and human BNB TEER enhancement following serum withdrawal in vitro that was dependent on RET-tyrosine kinase signaling.19 Cytoskeletal and junctional complex proteins implicated in specialized intercellular junction formation were also identified.
PMC6389127	R02003	Inhibitors against MEK1 and ERK1/2 completely inhibited the GDNF-mediated TEER increase down to basal levels by 48 hours following serum withdrawal while the RET-Tyrosine kinase inhibitor reduced the maximal TEER to basal levels with a lower decline compared to basal, MEK 1-inhibited and ERK1/2-inhibited conditions (Figure 3).
PMC6389127	R03001	RET-tyrosine kinase inhibition resulted in a statistically significant higher mean TEER increase and persistence compared to basal, MEK1 and ERK1/2-inhibited conditions, suggesting that GDNF may partially signal via non-RET-tyrosine kinase signaling pathways and utilize downstream MAPK-dependent intracellular signaling pathways to maintain elevated TEER following serum withdrawal in vitro.
PMC6389127	R04000	Overall, these data support the hypothesis that GDNF enhances human BNB TEER following initial confluent pHEndEC culture and serum withdrawal, dependent on RET-tyrosine kinase/MAPK signaling pathways in vitro without significant change in endothelial cell proliferation, using capacitance as a surrogate marker.
PMC6389127	R05006	The mean dextran-70-FITC permeabilities following serum withdrawal and concurrent treatment with GDNF and specific inhibitors of RET-tyrosine kinase, MEK1 and ERK1/2 were 2.95 (± 1.18)%, 2.54 (± 1.20)% and 2.54 (± 1.06)% respectively, and were not different from basal conditions based on normalized values under basal conditions without exogenous GDNF treatment.
PMC6389127	R06001	This is consistent with previously published initial observations of GDNF-mediated reduction in dextran-70-FITC permeability following serum withdrawal, as well as the observed more continuous intercellular contacts and fewer intercellular gaps (that may provide a route for paracellular transport or diffusion) between adjacent pHEndECs mediated by GDNF and RET tyrosine kinase following serum withdrawal in vitro.19
PMC6389127	R11001	Decreased expression of the following top 5 gene transcripts was also observed: PARD6B (cell polarity regulator; 907.0-fold), PRKCZ (serine/threonine kinase cell function regulator; 404.5-fold), CLDN8, CLDN4 (tight junction proteins; 188.7-fold and 155.4-fold respectively), and SPTA1 (cytoskeletal component; 88.0-fold), as shown in Figure 8.
PMC6389127	R12002	Changes in several regulators of cellular function such as regulation of cell polarity (increased PARD6A, MARK2, SMURF1, MPP5, MPDZ and PARD3; decreased PARD6B), specific serine/threonine kinases (increased CDK4, decreased PRKCZ), cell adhesion molecules/attachment regulators (increased ICAM2, ILK, ICAM1) were also observed following GDNF-mediated enhancement of human BNB restrictive biophysical properties following serum withdrawal in vitro.

PMC6430080	I00002	In this context, thiol proteins from the protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) family remain unexplored [2].
PMC6430080	I00003	The family prototype is PDIA1 (henceforth designated as PDI), a 55 kDa thiol oxidoreductase chaperone mainly from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which depicts a U-shaped structure comprising 4 thioredoxin tandem domains termed a-b-b'-a', plus a C-terminal domain.
PMC6430080	I00008	Despite being primarily an ER protein, PDI has been reported at other intracellular locations and also at the cell surface and extracellular milieu (a pool we have termed peri/epicellular protein disulfide isomerase = pecPDI)
PMC6430080	I01010	A multi-center efficacy clinical trial of isoquercetin as protein disulfide isomerase inhibitor against cancer-associated thrombosis is currently under way [17].
PMC6430080	I02009	Moreover, PDI supports protein complex organization, such as for NADPH oxidases [27].
PMC6430080	I02013	Thus, protein disulfide isomerase levels could potentially act as reporter of distinct proteome signatures in extracellular compartments such as plasma.
PMC6430080	I03003	In contrast, it has been recently suggested that extracellular PDI and other thiol isomerases are absent from the circulation as a way to suppress thrombus formation [22], while upon vascular wall injury PDI release from disrupted endothelium and bound platelets relieves such suppression and promotes thrombosis via disulfide modification of covalently-bound substrates.
PMC6430080	I03004	Here, we addressed the occurrence and physiological significance of a circulating pool of protein disulfide isomerase in healthy humans, with a focus on its role as reporter of distinct plasma protein signatures involved in endothelial phenotype and functional responses potentially associated with disease risk.
PMC6430080	R04006	Both effects were unrelated to circulating protein disulfide isomerase levels or degree of platelet activation.
PMC6430080	R05001	Cultured human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) were incubated for 24 h in medium with standard FBS (5%) or in medium in which FBS was replaced with 5% plasma collected from individuals with low or high protein disulfide isomerase levels, and the patterns of EC gene expression and protein secretion were assessed.
PMC6430080	R07000	Having shown correlation of specific protein signatures and associated EC phenotypes with plasma protein disulfide isomerase levels, we inquired whether the distinct observed plasma profiles correlate with functional EC outcomes.
PMC6451724	A00005	Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase (MASP) levels were positively associated with both incident type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.
PMC6451724	A00010	In combination, Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase, adiponectin and apoE improved type 2 diabetes prediction beyond non-invasive risk factors or HbA1c, age and sex.
PMC6451724	D00002	The results of this study also clearly show that Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase together with apoE and adiponectin improves the prediction of type 2 diabetes on top of non-invasive risk factor variables and on top of age, sex, and HbA1c concentrations, which are well-known to have a high predictive power [30].
PMC6451724	D01001	Moreover, higher Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase levels were associated with both higher fasting and 2-h-glucose levels [23].
PMC6451724	D02002	In our data Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase was specifically associated with elevated 2-h-glucose concentrations suggesting that particularly insulin secretion after glucose stimulation may be impaired.
PMC6451724	D03000	Since our Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase signal stems from peptides which are proteotypic for the three isoforms MASP-1, MASP-3, and MAP44, a clear discrimination between these isoforms is currently not possible.
PMC6451724	D03001	MASP-1 is the most abundant serine protease of the complement lectin pathway and thus a major player in the complement cascade which is initiated when a complex comprising mannose-binding lectin (MBL), MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs: MASP-1, MASP-2, MASP-3) and MBL-associated proteins (MAP19 and MAP44) binds to its target carbohydrate-containing ligands, primarily derived from pathogens or damaged tissues [33, 34].
PMC6451724	D04003	All three apolipoproteins correlate positively with the total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio and triglycerides [23] (although this fact is not completely understood for apoC-II, because this apolipoprotein is an essential cofactor for the lipoprotein lipase which mediates triglyceride hydrolysis [39]).
PMC6451724	D07005	HbA1c combined with information on age and sex is highly predictive, and the additional assessment of the circulating proteins Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase, apoE and adiponectin may improve the prediction even further.
PMC6451724	D09003	However, on top of HbA1c, age, and sex, Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase combined with CRP improved (pre)diabetes prediction significantly in terms of both IDI- and cfNRI-metrics.
PMC6451724	D11001	Moreover, it was unclear to which protein isoform the Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase signal belonged.

PMC6451724	M11001	Because the MASP protein signal comprised peptides derived from different protein isoforms, we conducted sensitivity analyses on the association between the individual Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase peptides and incident type 2 diabetes.
PMC6451724	R01003	[95% CI 0.617, 0.999] and MASP (1.306 [1.052, 1.621]) remained significantly associated with incident type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2); Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase also remained significantly associated with incident (pre)diabetes (1.241 [1.036, 1.486]).
PMC6451724	R02001	In the sensitivity analysis investigating separate associations between the three measured Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase peptides and incident diabetes, the ‘TGVI’ peptide showed the strongest association (OR per sex-specific SD = 1.392 [95% CI 1.132, 1.711], model 2a), followed by ‘AAGN’ (1.260 [1.024, 1.551]) and ‘SLPT’ (1.104 [0.897, 1.359]).
PMC6451724	R03001	Positive associations were observed for apoC-II with fasting glucose, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR, for C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as for glycosylphosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase D1 (GPLD1) with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR, and for apoA-IV and Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase with 2-h-glucose.
PMC6451724	R04001	A subset of three out of all 14 proteins, namely Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase, adiponectin and apoE, was found to best improve the prediction on top of the non-invasive risk factors, with an AUC of 0.772 [0.712, 0.828].
PMC6451724	R07002	While MASP did not add statistically significant information on top of the GDRSadapted-variables, Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase combined with CRP improved the (pre)diabetes prediction on top of age, sex, and HbA1c with an IDI of 0.021 [0.005, 0.036] and a cfNRI of 0.270
PMC6471199	D03010	Bile salt-activated lipase supports the digestion of fats in the immature infant digestive tract, and facilitates the absorption of cholesterol, vitamin A, and triacylglycerols
PMC6471199	D04000	Proteases may play a key role in the digestion of human milk.
PMC6471199	D04001	Although trypsin was the most abundant protease in Chinese and Dutch human milk, many other proteases (e.g., cytosol aminopeptidase, elastase, kallikrein, plasmin, cathepsins) were found, albeit to a lesser extent (Supplementary Information, data file).
PMC6471199	D04005	In particular, the caseins are well digested [16,17,18], which indicates that proteases and bile salt-activated lipase in human milk aids overall in the digestion of two of its main macronutrients, fats and proteins [19].
PMC6471199	D05003	As described by others, α1-antichymotrypsin binds to chymotrypsin and other chymotrypsin-like serine proteases in human milk, while α1-antitrypsin inhibits proteases, such as trypsin, elastase, plasmin, and thrombin, and irreversibly deactivates trypsin in vitro [12,13,14,15].
PMC6471199	D06000	Where some of the major proteins are partially digested by milk proteases in human milk, most immune-active proteins are less sensitive to digestion by these proteases, due to their compact folded globular structure, that cannot be as easily digested [16].
PMC6471199	D08002	This, together with the results presented in Table 2 and Table S2, indicates that the differences between Chinese and Dutch human milk serum proteins were mainly in their level throughout lactation, and not in their changes over lactation, as the levels of only 2 of the 166 (circa 1%) common serum proteins identified in this study (myristoylated alanine-rich c-kinase substrate and elongation factor 2) differed over the course of lactation (Figure 5, area A, showing difference in slope).
PMC6471199	R07001	Within the group enzymes, the highly abundant α-lactalbumin and bile salt-activated lipase are mainly responsible for the changes in this group in human milk over the course of lactation (Table 1).
PMC6471199	R09000	The levels of two serum proteins (elongation factor 2 and myristoylated alanine-rich c-kinase substrate) varied in the Chinese and Dutch human milk over the course of lactation, as shown by the significantly different slope (Figure 5, area A).
PMC6496011	D01008	Second, FA synthesis in cancer cells is transcriptionally regulated either hormonally or through oncogene signalling via kinase pathways, not by diet as occurs in lipogenic tissues.
PMC6496011	D01009	Third, the consequences of FASN inhibition differ widely between cancer and normal cells as FASN blockade rapidly induces apoptosis in human cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo with no effects towards normal cells, thus implying the reliance of cancer cell survival on fatty acid synthase activity.
PMC6496011	D02008	This HER1/2‐dependence of FASN‐induced enhanced cell survival (e.g. growth in soft agar) and protection from apoptosis (e.g. chemoresistance) resulted obvious when monitoring the responses of HBL100 cells transiently overexpressing fatty acid synthase to HER‐targeted TKis, as they become significantly more sensitive to the HER1 TKi gefitinib while acquiring an exquisite cytotoxic response to the HER1–HER2 dual inhibitor lapatinib.
PMC6496011	D03009	Indeed, we recently observed that pharmacological and siRNA‐induced inhibition of FASN in breast cancer cells negatively regulates its own expression by shutting‐down fatty acid synthase gene promoter activity (data not shown).
PMC6496011	D04002	Although we acknowledge that animal experiments are needed to substantiate this hypothesis, a very recent report by Priolo et al. (2006) revealed that the ubiquitin‐specific protease 2a (USP2a), which interacts and stabilizes FASN in prostate cancer cells (Graner et al. 2004), exhibits oncogenic behaviour both in vitro and in vivo and prevented apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents when overexpressed in non‐transformed cells (Priolo et al. 2006).
PMC6496011	D04005	Supporting this notion, a recent study characterizing genome‐wide changes accompanying knockdown of FASN in breast cancer cells (Knowles & Smith 2007) evidenced the ability of fatty acid synthase to modulate a wide network of pathways that regulate several aspects of tumour function, including metabolism, cell survival/proliferation, DNA replication/transcription, and protein degradation.
PMC6496011	D05000	The concept that FASN overexpressipon/hyperactivation would impart immortalized cells with a profound neoplasic growth/survival advantage over those maintaining physiological levels of endogenous FA biosynthesis strongly suggests that fatty acid synthase can work as a previously unrecognized metabolic intermediate of oncogenesis linking cellular anabolism and malignant transformation.

PMC6496011	F72001	Fatty acid synthase inhibition triggers apoptosis during S phase in human cancer cells.
PMC6496011	I01000	Most attention in the past few years has been directed at fatty acid synthase (FASN), the main enzyme involved in FA synthesis, that catalyses NADPH‐dependent condensation of acetyl‐coenzyme A (CoA) and malonyl‐CoA, mainly to produce palmitate (Wakil 1989; Smith 1994; Maier et al. 2006).
PMC6496011	I01006	Thus, activation of fatty acid synthase gene in breast carcinomas cells is commonly viewed as a mere (down‐stream) manifestation of early and common deregulation of (up‐stream) regulatory circuits (e.g. hormones/growth factors hormone receptors/growth factor receptors lipogenic transcription factors lipogenic genes) (Kuhajda 2006;
PMC6496011	I02000	We have recently demonstrated that pharmacological and RNAi‐mediated inhibition of FASN profoundly affects expression, activity and/or cellular localization of proteins closely related to breast malignant transformation and/or breast cancer progression, including Her‐2/neu (erbB‐2), HIF‐1α, vascular endothelial growth factor, oestrogen receptor, mitogen‐activated protein kinase, p53‐p21WAF1/CIP1, p27Kip1 and BRCA1 (Menendez & Lupu 2004, 2006; Menendez et al. 2004a,2004c, 2004d, 2005b, 2005e,f; Lupu & Menendez 2006a).
PMC6496011	I02005	Souttou et al. 1994; Hu et al. 2002) and MCF10A cells (non‐transformed, near diploid, spontaneously immortalized human mammary epithelial cell line; Ciardiello et al. 1992; Giunciuglio et al. 1995), with full‐length human fatty acid synthase cDNA.
PMC6496011	I02006	Here, we present evidence that FASN‐catalysed endogenous FA biogenesis, on its own can trigger an invasive breast cancer‐like phenotype, functionally dependent on tyrosine kinase activity of HER1 (EGFR) and HER2, thus recapitulating a complex cross‐talk existing in many breast carcinomas with the worst prognosis.
PMC6496011	R00008	Importantly for this study, HBL100 cells naturally express extremely low levels of fatty acid synthase (Fig. 2a).
PMC6496011	R01008	To further corroborate these findings, mock‐ and pCMV6‐XL4/FASN‐transfected HBL100 cells were exposed to 2‐14C‐labelled acetate, allowing the measurement of the effects of acute fatty acid synthase overexpression on lipid synthesis in live cells.
PMC6496011	R02003	Malignant conversion of HBL100 cells at high passage level (> 50), which was evidenced in our experiments by enhanced growth in soft agar (data not shown), was likewise accompanied by a significant increase in both the endogenous level of fatty acid synthase expression and the lipid synthesis in live HBL100 cells (Fig. 2d).
PMC6496011	R03006	Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation experiments confirmed that fatty acid synthase overexpression significantly increased proliferation of HBL100 and NIH‐3T3 cells (data not shown).
PMC6496011	R04007	Whereas parental and mock‐transfected HBL100 cells exhibited extremely low levels of apoptosis upon treatment with C75 (1.7‐fold increase versus 1.0‐fold in untreated HBL100 cells), HBL100 cells engineered to overexpress fatty acid synthase were exquisitely sensitive to the pro‐apoptotic effects of C75 (up to 8.1‐fold increase versus 1.0‐fold in untreated HBL100/pCMV6‐XL4/FASN cells).
PMC6496011	R05000	Acute overexpression of FASN enhances the tyrosine‐kinase activity of HER1 (EGFR) and HER2 in breast epithelial cells.
PMC6496011	R05010	Moreover, when HBL100 cells were forced to overexpress FASN gene in the presence of the chemical fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75, they did not exhibit any significant up‐regulation of phosphotyrosine‐Tyr‐containing proteins (Fig. 4b).
PMC6496011	R06000	To investigate whether FASN‐induced trans‐activation of the HER network members HER1 and HER2 was a molecular phenomenon not restricted to HBL100 cells and to evaluate whether an exacerbated endogenous FA metabolism affected phospho‐receptor Tyr‐kinases other than HER1 and HER2, we took advantage of the recently developed Human Proteome Profiler™ (R&D Systems Inc.).
PMC6496011	R06001	This rapid, sensitive and semiquantitative protein array technology can simultaneously identify and screen the levels of Tyr‐phosphorylation of up to 42 receptor Tyr‐kinases (RTKs) without performing numerous immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblotting analyses.
PMC6496011	R06006	The proliferative rate was significantly higher in MCF10A cells acutely forced to overexpress FASN than in mock‐transfected and parental MCF10A cells (data not shown) while exposure to chemical fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75 drastically impaired cell viability, with some FASN‐overexpressing MCF10A cells noticeably exhibiting apoptotic features (Fig. 4c).
PMC6496011	R08009	Therefore, HBL100 cells engineered to overexpress fatty acid synthase did reach HER1 levels comparable to those found in breast cancer cells lines naturally exhibiting HER1‐gene amplification and HER1‐protein overexpression (e.g. ∼300 ng and 900 ng of EGFR per mg protein in BT20 and MDA‐MB‐468 cells, respectively) (Konecny et al. 2006).
PMC6496011	R09007	That is, acute fatty acid synthase overexpression was sufficient to increase > 15 times the sensitivity of HBL100 cells to lapatinib (Fig. 5b).
PMC6496011	R10002	An equivalent protection was also observed when HBL100 cells acutely expressing fatty acid synthase were treated with paclitaxel (data not shown).

PMC6713475	D05001	We were intrigued by these interactions given the similar CRISPR screening scoring pattern of DCAF15 to the cohesin factors STAG2 and HDAC8 (Figure 2E); the shared roles of cohesin and CRL4 E3 ligases in DNA metabolism, organization, replication and repair (Uhlmann, 2016; O'Connell and Harper, 2007; Litwin et al., 2018); and the ability of cohesin mutations to dysregulate hematopoietic differentiation in myeloid malignancies (Mazumdar and Majeti, 2017).

PMC6713475	R05001	Most surprisingly, the top-ranked mechanism for promoting NK-92 mediated clearance was disruption of DCAF15, an uncharacterized substrate adaptor for CRL4 ubiquitin E3 ligases.
PMC6713475	R22001	Recently, it was discovered that these agents work by binding DCAF15 and redirecting the ubiquitination activity of the CRL4-DCAF15 E3 ligase towards the essential splicing factor RBM39 (Han et al., 2017; Uehara et al., 2017).
PMC6713475	R22002	This mechanism of action is conceptually similar to that of the ‘IMiD’ thalidomide analogs, which promote the degradation of various lymphocyte transcription factors by engaging the CRL4-cereblon E3 ubiquitin ligase (Ito et al., 2010;

PMC6714885	D00000	The discovery and molecular characterization of RNA-programmable Cas9 nuclease emerged from basic research on the type II CRISPR-Cas system from GAS and has provided a revolutionary biotechnological tool for genome engineering, with promising potential to develop novel strategies to fight and cure many diseases (Le Rhun et al., 2019).
PMC6714885	D05002	Similar evidence of Cas9 regulatory effect over virulence-related transcriptional regulators have been seen in GBS, where the nuclease influenced transcriptional regulator RegR, the modulator of hyaluronidase activity, a key virulence factor involved in GBS blood-brain barrier invasion during meningitis (Ma et al., 2018).
PMC6714885	D07000	Considering the highly specific endonuclease activity of Cas9, one potential mechanism underlying Cas9 effects on virulence regulation is that the nuclease may complex with the tracrRNA encoded inmediately downstram of Cas9 in the GAS genome (Figure 1A).

PMC6714885	I00001	CRISPR-Cas systems are widely distributed in many bacterial and archaeal genomes (Makarova et al., 2015; Burstein et al., 2016), and are evolutionarily classified in two main classes, with class II as the most representative and uniquely driven by the nuclease Cas9 (Makarova et al., 2015).
PMC6714885	I03000	Although Cas9 nuclease is found in many bacterial genomes, the native source of the Cas9 used in genome engineering is Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, GAS).
PMC6714885	R00000	To explore the functional role of Cas9 in GAS, we generated a precise in-frame allelic exchange mutant in the background of the well characterized globally disseminated GAS serotype M1T1 strain 5448 (Chatellier et al., 2000), wherein the cas9 gene in the type IIA CRISPR operon was replaced with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene (Figure 1A) as validated by PCR and sequence analysis.
PMC6714885	R00001	Functional confirmation of gene deletion in the GAS Δcas9 mutant strain was achieved in both mid-exponential and stationary growth phase cultures by real-time qPCR (Figure 1B) and western immunoblot using specific antibodies raised against the GAS nuclease (Figure 1C).
PMC6714885	R03002	The most enhanced subcategories in the Δcas9 mutant strain were “Sugar alcohols” and “Membrane Transport” (Figure 2A), including glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase (encoded by M5005_Spy0647) and cofactor transporters (encoded by cbiQ and cbiO1) (Supplementary Table S3).
PMC6714885	R03003	In contrast, the most pronounced subcategories enriched in the WT strain were “Electron Accepting Reactions” and “Respiration” (Figure 2A), including important bacterial metabolic proteins such as arsenate reductase (encoded by arcA), glycerol dehydrogenase (encoded by gdlA), and ferrodoxin (encoded by M5005_Spy0616) (Supplementary Table S3).
PMC6714885	R04004	Among these is HtrA, a serine protease directly associated with maturation of two key pathogenic factors: cysteine protease SpeB and pore-forming toxin streptolysin S (SLS) (Lyon and Caparon, 2004).
PMC6714885	R05000	Group A Streptococcus genes encoding proteins induced during human neutrophil phagocytosis (Voyich et al., 2003) were also significantly reduced in Cas9 deficiency, including detoxifiers of cell-damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as AhpC and DnaK, and sortase A (sortase), the transpeptidase required for cell wall anchoring of surface virulence factors such as M protein, GRAB and protein F (Barnett and Scott, 2002; Raz and Fischetti, 2008).
PMC6714885	R07003	This included the master TCS CovR/CovS, which influences transcription of up to 15% of all GAS chromosomal genes, including repression of hyaluronic acid capsule, SLS precursor SagA, streptokinase (SkA), cysteine protease SpeB and other secreted GAS factors (Graham et al., 2002).
PMC6714885	R08002	Similarly, protein abundance levels of the transcriptional regulator PerR and the histidine kinase YvqE were reduced in the absence of Cas9; these proteins are known to directly upregulate GAS responses to oxidative stress and thereby enhancing resistance and virulence in the host (Grifantini et al., 2011), and signaling-mediated control of biofilm formation and pilus expression (Isaka et al., 2016), respectively.
PMC6714885	R09000	In summary, loss of Cas9 is associated with changes of several GAS virulence-related regulatory elements, generally fitting a pattern of reduced activators and enhanced repressors, suggesting an important role of the nuclease on the overall virulence of the bacterium.

PMC7087397	I13005	Numerous activity-based probes (ABPs) have been developed and deployed for many enzyme classes, including serine hydrolases (Kidd et al., 2001; Liu et al., 1999), cysteine proteases (Kato et al., 2005), metallohydrolases, phosphatases, deubiquinating enzymes (Hewings et al., 2018;
PMC7087397	I13006	Ward et al., 2016), kinases (Zhao et al., 2017), various oxidreductases and others.
PMC7087397	I14002	The first class of enzymes targeted for ABPP studies were the serine hydrolases (SHs), a large and diverse family of enzymes that perform numerous roles in physiological and pathological processes.
PMC7087397	I15001	Electrophilic click-ABPs have been developed for kinases (Zhao et al., 2017), protein arginine deiminases (PADs) (Nemmara et al., 2018; Slack et al., 2011), ubiquitin machinery (An and Statsyuk, 2013; Hewings et al., 2018), cytochrome P450 enzymes (Wright and Cravatt, 2007), and glycosidase enzymes (Tsai et al., 2013).
PMC7087397	I15005	These platforms enabled the profiling of 150-200 endogenous kinases in a single cell line, however, neither are cell permeable, requiring membrane dissolution and disruption of protein complexes during lysis, potentially altering kinase conformation and activity.
PMC7087397	I15006	To overcome this limitation, the Tauton lab, in a collaboration with colleagues at Pfizer, developed a cell-permeable sulfonyl fluoride-based click probe (Figure 6) that target a conserved lysine in the ATP binding site which captures 133 phylogenetically diverse kinases in cells, 50 of which were not captured by kinobeads, highlighting the utility and complementarity of click ABPs to other platforms (Zhao et al., 2017).
PMC7087397	I16003	For example, a recent competitive ABPP screen against SHs led to the discovery of a selective and in vivo active covalent inhibitor of palmitoyl protein thioesterase (PPT1), mutations of which cause infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.
PMC7087397	I16006	Recently, highly potent and orally available activity-based inhibitors were developed for monoacylglycerol lipase (monoacylglycerol lipase), an SH that controls the content and signaling of the endogenous cannabinoid 2-archidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the central nervous system.
PMC7087397	I17013	For example, competitive isoTOP-ABPP has been used to identify sites on proteins modified by lipid-derived electrophiles, such as oxidative stress product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), resulting in modulation of endogenous proteins, such as ZAK kinase (Wang et al., 2014).
PMC7087397	I17016	Initial broad-reactive fragments identified in such studies have been used to develop lead covalent ligands of protein targets, including compounds that selectively target pro-caspase-8 (Backus et al., 2016) and the transcriptional regulator NR0B1 (Bar-Peled et al., 2017) to investigate their physiological and pathophysiological roles.
PMC7087397	I20002	For example, metalloproteases (MPs), a large and diverse group of enzymes that play key roles in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, use a zinc-activated water molecule for catalysis.
PMC7087397	I20004	Similarly, histone deacetylases utilize zinc-activated water in their active sites, enabling the development of zinc chelating suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) based click ABPs to profile HDAC activity in cells (Salisbury and Cravatt, 2007, 2008).
PMC7087397	I20007	Horning et al. described a set of S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) photoaffinity (diazirine and benzophenone) probes with a high selectivity for methyltransferases (MTs) in cells as well as MT inhibitor discovery via competitive ABPP (Horning et al., 2016).
PMC7087397	I21010	For example, simple fragment leads identified in comparative profiling studies were subsequently utilized in competitive profiling experiments (Figure 5B) to generate first-in-class inhibitors for prostaglandin reductase 2 (PTGR2) and the multi-pass transmembrane protein SLC25A20.
PMC7087397	I23005	For example, photoaffinity click probes of a BACE1 β-secretase inhibitor revealed that cathepsin D (CatD) is a common off-target of several clinical BACE inhibitors, which may contribute to observed ocular toxicity in vivo (Zuhl et al., 2016).
PMC7087397	I23013	For example, click probes have been used to assess the target landscape of covalent kinase inhibitors (Gushwa et al., 2012; Lannine et al., 2014; Niessen et al., 2017) and various bioactive natural products (Wright and Sieber, 2016).
PMC7087397	I23014	Click probes have also recently been used to identify covalent targets of reactive drug metabolites, including that of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor BIA 10-2474 (Figure 6), a clinical candidate that failed Phase I trials due to serious neurotoxicity which led to the death of one human volunteer (Bateman et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2019; van Esbroeck et al., 2017).
PMC7087397	I27009	Once internalized, the O- acetates are removed by esterases and the resulting ManNAz can be biosynthetically transformed into an azide-containing sialic acid monosaccharide that is then added to the termini of N-linked and mucin O-linked glycans.
PMC7087397	I29002	Specifically, terminal GlcNAc moieties can be labeled using a combination of radioactive UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) and a β1,4-galactosyltransferase (GalT), which generates a Gal-GlcNAc disaccharide on O-GlcNAcylated proteins that can be detected by autoradiography (Torres and Hart, 1984).
PMC7087397	I29003	Replacing the native galactosyltransferase with a mutant (Y289L) enabled the enzymatic transfer of N-azidoacetylgalactosamine (GalNAz) from UDP-GalNAz to generate a disaccharide bearing an azide for subsequent bioorthogonal chemistry (Table 1) (Clark et al., 2008).
PMC7087397	I31004	Again, the use of small bioorthogonal handles was absolutely required for this technology, as these relatively small modifications can be tolerated by the cellular metabolic and transferase enzymes.
PMC7087397	I31009	This same reporter was also combined with SILAC to identify myristoylation events that were sensitive to an N-myristoyltransferase inhibitor (Thinon et al., 2014).
PMC7087397	I32002	Acetate is added to proteins by a family of acetyltransferases that use the high-energy acetyl-CoA cofactor, and the modification can be removed by another family of deacetylases.
PMC7087397	I32007	The utility of this short alkyne acid as an MCR for lysine acetylation was then bolstered by the fact that purified p300 acetyltransferase can utilize synthetic 4- pentynonyl-CoA to label proteins in cell lysates (Yang et al., 2011).
PMC7087397	I32012	More specifically, an alkyne-containing thioester was synthesized that mimics acetyl-CoA but cannot be used by acetyltransferases (Table 1) (Kulkarni et al., 2017).
PMC7087397	I33002	Methylation is added to proteins by distinct lysine- and arginine-methyltransferases that all use S-adenoyl-L- methionine (SAM) as a cofactor.
PMC7087397	I33003	The modification can then be removed by two families of demethylases that are defined by their differential enzymatic mechanisms.
PMC7087397	I33007	In vitro analysis demonstrated that these SAM analogs were accepted by a subset of the methyltransferases tested.
PMC7087397	I33010	This goal was subsequently realized through rational engineering of the methyltransferase active site, enabling the labeling and identification of methyltransferase-specific substrates (Table 1) (Islam et al., 2012; Islam et al., 2013).
PMC7087397	I34001	In humans, a family of 17 ADP-ribosyltransferases, termed poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), can add this modification.
PMC7087397	I34002	Despite their name, the majority of PARPs appear to be mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases while a subset can generate poly-ADP-ribose through the extension of the ADP-ribose chain.
PMC7087397	I34003	This modification can also be rendered dynamic through removal by ADP-ribose hydrolases.
PMC7087397	I35006	Notably, this probe was used to identify a sulfenylated cysteine in the active site of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that increases its kinase activity (Paulsen et al., 2011).

PMC7532684	I00003	Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting EGFR were used as the first-line treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors harbor EGFR mutations 5; however, those patients eventually develop acquired resistance through either secondary EGFR mutations, e.g., T790M, or activation of the bypass track signaling pathways, such as activation of RTK AXL to maintain persistent oncogenic EGFR signaling 6.

PMC7539533	D00001	Biochemistry and cell biology experiments (Figures 3, ​,4,4, ​,5,5, and ​and7)7) confirmed that pUL56 binds directly to GOPC, is both necessary and sufficient to promote GOPC degradation, requires the recruitment of the NEDD4 family of ubiquitin ligases via its PPXY motifs to stimulate GOPC ubiquitination and degradation, and results in changes in the cell-surface proteome through the loss of GOPC.
PMC7539533	D05001	Our IP-MS data revealed that pUL56 binds multiple cellular NEDD4 family ubiquitin ligases and the trafficking factor GOPC (Figure 3A).
PMC7539533	D05004	Taken together, these data demonstrate that pUL56 serves as a scaffold to bring GOPC and a NEDD4 family ubiquitin ligase together in order to promote GOPC ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
PMC7539533	D07001	For example, HIV-1 Vpu recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of several cell-surface proteins (Matheson et al., 2015).

PMC7539533	R05011	Taken together, these results suggest a model whereby pUL56 binds both GOPC and the NEDD4 family of ubiquitin ligases, bringing them in close proximity and thus stimulating the ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation of GOPC.
PMC7539533	R06009	To further test the importance of NEDD4 family E3 ubiquitin ligase binding for GOPC degradation by pUL56, a recombinant virus was generated where all three pUL56 PPXY motifs were mutated to AAXA.

PMC8006721	I00000	The majority of deaths from the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS‐CoV‐2) occurred in patients with cardiovascular disease, who often were on chronic treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB).
PMC8006721	I01000	We aimed to address this concern by evaluating the in vivo effect of treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and ARB on circulating plasma concentrations of ACE2 in a large cohort of patients with established cardiovascular disease (n = 1864) or cardiovascular risk factors (n = 2144), but without a history of heart failure (NCT01838148, ClinicalTrials.gov).

PMC8006721	R00002	Also, plasma concentration of ACE2 was comparable in 2474 patients on either ACE inhibitors or ARB (mean 5.99) versus patients without angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or ARB (mean 5.98, P = 0.31).
PMC8006721	R01000	Multivariable quantile regression model analysis adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, history of atrial fibrillation, diabetes, arterial hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, myocardial infarction, coronary artery disease, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass graft confirmed the lack of association between treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or ARB and ACE2 concentrations.
PMC8036843	A00006	The notable upregulated urinary proteins were serotransferrin, transthyretin, serum albumin, ceruloplasmin, alpha-1B-glycoprotein, syntenin-1, and glutaminyl peptide cyclotransferase, whereas the three notable downregulated proteins were plasma kallikrein, protein glutamine gamma-glutamyl transferase, and serpin B3 (SERPINB3).
PMC8036843	D04000	Serpin B3 is a serine proteinase inhibitor acting on cysteine proteinases such as cathepsin and chymotrypsin.
PMC8036843	D05007	Syntenin-1 is known to be involved in the trafficking of receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase, whose expression was found to be reduced in several thyroid oncogene-transformed cells or absent in highly malignant thyroid cells [28].
PMC8036843	D06000	Along with syntenin-1, another transmembrane domain protein identified in our study was PI4phosphate 3kinase (PI4P3K) domain protein.
PMC8036843	D06002	The PI4phosphate 3kinase protein belongs to a large group of tetraspanin proteins implicated in a variety of biological phenomena, including wound healing, immune responses, tumor cell migration, and invasion [25,30], maturation and processing of associated transmembrane proteins, and intracellular sorting of the associated receptors [31].
PMC8036843	D07001	Three notable proteins identified among the seven were plasma kallikrein and PTPA and protein glutamine gamma-glutamyl transferase.
PMC8036843	D09000	Protein glutamine gamma-glutamyl transferase, an enzyme of the transglutaminase family that catalyzes the posttranslational modification of proteins at glutamine residues, with the formation of isopeptide bonds, cross-linking of proteins, and the conjugation of polyamines to proteins [36].
PMC8036843	D10000	We identified a decrease in the abundance of serine/threonine-protein phosphatase activator (also known as phosphotyrosyl phosphatase activator (PTPA)), which is responsible for stimulating the phosphotyrosyl phosphatase (phosphotyrosyl phosphatase), such as protein phosphatase 2A, which catalyzes the reversible dephosphorylation of tyrosyl residues of their substrates that include the receptor tyrosine kinases to promote protein–protein interactions within the cell.

PMC8036843	R02008	Among the identified proteins, alpha-1B-glycoprotein, serum albumin, glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase, and polymeric immunoglobulin receptors were found in more than one spot on the gels, which could be explained by posttranslational modifications, cleavage by enzymes, or the presence of different protein species.
PMC8038828	A00007	Results: This study identified that catalase (CAT) was significantly downregulated after LVA (pre-LVA vs. post-LVA, 2651 ± 2101 vs. 1448 ± 593 ng/mL, respectively, p = 0.033).
PMC8038828	A00008	There were significantly higher levels of post-LVA serum total antioxidant capacity (pre-LVA vs. post-LVA, 441 ± 81 vs. 488 ± 59 µmole/L, respectively, p = 0.031) and glutathione peroxidase (pre-LVA vs. post-LVA, 73 ± 20 vs. 92 ± 29 U/g, respectively, p = 0.018) than pre-LVA serum.
PMC8038828	A00009	In addition, after LVA, there were significantly more differences between post-LVA and pre-LVA serum levels of catalase (good outcome vs. fair outcome, −2593 ± 2363 vs. 178 ± 603 ng/mL, respectively, p = 0.021) and peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX2) (good outcome vs. fair outcome, −7782 ± 7347 vs. −397 ± 1235 pg/mL, respectively, p = 0.037) in those patients with good outcomes (≥40% volume reduction in MR volumetry) than those with fair outcomes (<40% volume reduction in MR volumetry).
PMC8038828	D00009	Therefore, the significant serum catalase reduction after LVA may signify a reduction in oxidative stress associated with a decrease in lymphedematous volume.

PMC8054439	D00002	Regarding pathogen protease-host interactions, TAILS has been used in recent studies of viral proteases to discover their host substrates (Hill et al., 2018; Jagdeo et al., 2018).
PMC8054439	D00003	Here, we present a study of a bacterial protease on the infection-relevant host substrate, human serum.
PMC8054439	D00006	The substrates identified in our study could be considered validated, since we identified previously described substrates of V8 protease, such as Ig and complement components.
PMC8054439	D01003	Given the proof of concept shown here for V8 protease, N-terminomics offers the prospect of discovering cryptic substrates for the Spls, and indeed any other bacterial protease, in a variety of potential host niches.
PMC8054439	D02002	V8 cleaved outside of the RCL/BR domains of these inhibitors, the region responsible for baiting and irreversibly binding proteases.
PMC8054439	D02003	Regarding the clotting cascade, although we highlight the potential V8-induced disruption of SERPIN-mediated inhibition of factor X and XII, and thrombin, V8 is likely to inhibit the clotting cascade given that it also cleaves these proteases.

PMC8054439	I00002	Produced alongside these are ten extracellular proteases: a metalloprotease (aureolysin, aur), a V8 (SspA) serine protease, two cysteine proteases (staphopain A [ScpA] and staphopain B [SspB]), and 6 serine-protease-like enzymes (SplABCDEF) (Reed et al., 2001; Shaw et al., 2004).
PMC8054439	I00004	In an early study by Coulter, a V8 protease mutant was shown to be attenuated in 3 separate animal models of infection (Coulter et al., 1998).
PMC8054439	I01001	Proteomic analysis revealed that toxin and exoenzyme abundance had increased in cultures of Δprotease (Kolar et al., 2013).
PMC8054439	I01003	Accordingly, secreted proteases appear to be master regulators of virulence, by controlling the stability of S. aureus virulence factors.
PMC8054439	I02001	Thus, the impairment in virulence of Δprotease stems from a key role for these enzymes in attacking the host, cleaving proteins that facilitate nutrition, immune evasion, and movement to new sites of infection.
PMC8054439	I02002	This notion is supported by in vitro literature where S. aureus-secreted proteases have been shown to cleave numerous human proteins, including elastin, plasminogen, fibronectin, fibrinogen, the heavy chains of all human immunoglobulin (Ig) classes, high-molecular-weight kininogen, human α1-proteinase inhibitor, α1-antichymotrypsin, and complement components (Wegrzynowicz et al., 1980; Potempa et al., 1986, 1988;
PMC8054439	I03000	A major bottleneck to the study of proteases has been the slow and complex nature of substrate identification.
PMC8054439	I03001	Much of the work performed thus far on S. aureus proteases has made use of purified protein and immunoblotting strategies, leading to a one-at-a-time approach for target identification.
PMC8054439	I03006	Discovery of previously unknown host substrates of viral proteases from Poliovirus and Coxsackievirus (Jagdeo et al., 2018) and Zika virus (Hill et al., 2018) using N-terminomics has also been recently described.
PMC8054439	I03007	However, with the exception of the work by Overall and colleagues during development of the TAILS N-terminomics method (described below), where fibroblast secretomes were degraded by bacterial GluC/V8 for the purposes of method validation (Kleifeld et al., 2010), N-terminomics approaches have not been used to study the impact of proteolysis at the host-bacteria-interface, or in discovery of novel host targets of bacterial proteases (Marshall et al., 2017).
PMC8054439	I04000	Of the S. aureus-secreted proteases, V8 is perhaps the most well understood, being first described in the 1970s (Drapeau et al., 1972), with its high proteolytic activity but strict specificity for cleavage after glutamic acid (and to a lesser extent aspartic acid residues) being well established (Drapeau et al., 1972; Sørensen et al., 1991).
PMC8054439	I04001	Therefore, to begin our investigation of protease-host substrate interactions, we selected the V8 protease and assessed its ability to cleave human serum proteins, an infection relevant source of soluble substrates.
PMC8054439	M03006	Mutants deficient in either sspA (encoding V8 protease) or all ten secreted proteases (ΔsspA and Δprotease, respectively) have been previously described (Kolar et al., 2013; Ramirez et al., 2020).
PMC8054439	M03008	This was then transduced using φ11 into the USA300 LAC strain (to produce Δspa) as well as the protease null strain to produce ΔspaΔprotease.
PMC8054439	M03010	All oligonucleotides used are described in Table S6, and all plasmid insertions achieved by PCR of inserts (described below), restriction digest using NEB restriction enzymes (Table S6), and ligation using a T4 ligase kit (Promega).
PMC8054439	M04001	S. aureus V8 protease was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (catalog no. P2922).
PMC8054439	M04003	Prior to N-terminomics and immunoblotting, all serum or albumin depleted (AD) serum was incubated at 37°C in the presence or absence of V8 protease (5–50 μg/ml for immunoblotting, 5 μg/ml for N-terminomics) for 16 hours.
PMC8054439	M05003	Dry guanidium hydrochloride (6 M final concentration) was added to inactivate proteases following incubation.
PMC8054439	M13006	This method of N-terminome analysis differs from previously described analyses due to its emphasis on unique N-terminal peptides, but highlights putative cleavage sites for the exogenous protease (V8 in this study), and is thus useful for studies of pathogen proteases in the host.
PMC8054439	R03008	The inhibitory effect on V8 of proline at P1′ (and to a lesser extent P3) is also observed in the MEROPS database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/merops, [Rawlings et al., 2018], MEROPS: S01.269, glutamyl endopeptidase I).
PMC8054439	R07000	Regarding the host protease inhibitors, α−2 macroglobulin (A2M) was also extensively cleaved by V8, including in the bait region (BR), which is typically responsible for covalent binding and inactivation of serine proteases.
PMC8054439	R07003	V8 cleavage at these positions may act to destabilize A2M tertiary structure and could result in an inability to trap proteases, since conformational change subsequent to cleavage of the BR is a key part of inhibitory activity (Bowen and Gettins, 1998), where A2M encloses the active site of a target protease.
PMC8054439	R07004	Furthermore, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of A2M, which functions in the clearance of activated A2M-protease complexes, was also cleaved.
PMC8054439	R07010	In addition to evasion of the protease-trapping mechanism in a fashion similar to A2M, inactivation of SERPINs may be directly relevant to pathogenesis, with epithelial cell-derived SERPINs (SCCA1 and SCCA2) shown to inhibit S. aureus cysteine protease degradation of SERPINs (Kantyka et al., 2011) thereby preventing entrapment.
PMC8054439	R07012	Neutrophil elastase can cause tissue damage and is inhibited by SERPINA1, but the host-derived MMP-9 (gelatinase-B) regulates this inhibitory effect by degrading the SERPIN (Liu et al., 2000).
PMC8054439	R07013	Thus, V8 may enhance host tissue damage indirectly through dysregulation of neutrophil elastase.
PMC8054439	R11003	Three functional clusters can be observed: the complement and clotting cascades, and protease (inter-α-trypsin) inhibitors.
PMC8054439	R12005	This notion of proteases assisting dissemination by cleavage of host factors fits with the phenotypic switching seen during S. aureus growth, where a population of S. aureus reaches a sufficient density, inducing the Agr quorum sensing system, which promotes protease production and reduces biofilm formation (Boles and Horswill, 2008).
PMC8054439	R14001	Several of the identified V8 substrates are known to act (through intermediates) with the ubiquitously expressed extracellular signal related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2, ERK not observed in the N-terminome), which were also highlighted during our analysis.
PMC8054439	R14002	ERKs are intracellular phosphokinases, activated by a variety of plasma membrane receptors in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli (Roux and Blenis, 2004).
PMC8054439	R14006	However, protease expression is greatest in the later phases of S. aureus growth (Shaw et al., 2004); therefore, S. aureus may exert a bi-directional impact on host ERK signaling, upregulating it via adhesin-mediated attachment and invasion during the early stages of infection, but later downregulating it through the action of secreted proteases, including V8.
PMC8054439	R16003	We did consider creating a plasmid encoding the C-terminally tagged V8 protease, but as indicated by crystal structures (described above) the C-terminal tail is absent in the native, mature secreted protein, while tagging results in the C-terminal tail being retained, so this option was ruled out.
PMC8054439	R17003	Therefore, aur was also cloned into the cadmium inducible vector, transduced into the Δprotease strain and V8-deficient (ΔsspA) strains, and empty vector (EV) strains were also created (Table S6).
PMC8054439	R18003	In addition, secreted staphylococcal Ig binding protein A (Spa) bound antibodies used in all blots, obscuring resolution of human proteins and their degradation products (Figure S4, band at ~50 kDa).
PMC8054439	R18007	A2M was notably degraded only in the Δprotease +aur/sspA condition in the Δspa experiment, but in the spa replete experiment the band corresponding to A2M at ~250 kDa is degraded in the parent strain (LAC EV), Δprotease +aur, and Δprotease +aur/sspA.
PMC8054439	R19005	In both cases, SERPINA1 was detected in the absence of 1,10-phenanthroline, and a small amount of degradation was visible in the LAC EV and Δprotease + aur, and Δprotease +aur/sspA conditions with 1 mg culture supernatant but not in the 0.1 mg condition.
PMC8054439	R20004	The proteolysis of PrtH in the presence of supernatants is evident across all conditions, even the Δprotease strain.
PMC8054439	R20007	The interactome is made all the more complex by the effect of S. aureus-secreted proteases on its own secretome (Kolar et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2014; Byrum et al., 2018), with work described here utilizing protease mutants and complemented strains with host interactions that are not fully characterized.
PMC8054439	R21000	Given that the Δprotease mutant is already known to display reduced growth in serum (Kolar et al., 2013), and our N-terminomic data show a clear role for V8 in serum proteolysis, our final approach was to determine the contribution of this protease to the survival of S. aureus in human serum.
PMC8054439	R21002	The requirement for Aur in V8 activation rendered ΔsspA the only practical choice, as opposed to using Δprotease.

PMC8078281	I01000	Ibrutinib is a potent and irreversibly binding small-molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK).2 Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibition blocks the transmission of important growth and survival signals through the B-cell receptor (BCR) in CLL cells.
PMC8078281	I02002	Inhibition of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase by ibrutinib reduces the expression of the CXCL12 receptor C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) on leukemic B cells, which in turn leads to a rapid release of CLL cells from the lymphoid organs into the peripheral blood (PB).6–8 CLL cells with low CXCR4 surface expression do not migrate back to tissue niches and are therefore deprived of survival signals.7
PMC8078281	I03000	Nonmalignant B cells that exist in the shadow of their transformed counterparts in CLL are presumably affected by ibrutinib as well, since BTK is an essential enzyme in physiological B-cell development.9 Moreover, the enzymatic activity of other kinases that have a similarly aligning cysteine residue to Bruton’s tyrosine kinase is also inhibited by ibrutinib.2,10,11 Such “off-target” binding could potentially contribute to the clinical efficacy of ibrutinib, as well as to side effects.
PMC8078281	M00004	PB samples from 9 healthy donors were used as controls and PB samples from 8 patients with XLA harboring a verified mutation in Bruton’s tyrosine kinase were acquired from the hospital’s immunodeficiency unit.
PMC8078281	R06002	Moreover, only 2 of them were modestly altered in XLA as compared to pretreatment samples (Figure ​(Figure5),5), suggesting that the levels of most of these biomarkers are unrelated to Bruton’s tyrosine kinase activity in non-B cells and instead represent “off-target” effects.
PMC8078281	R12003	Moreover, CD5 marks both CLL and mantle cell lymphoma, which both respond to Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors, while other B cell malignancies lack, or show low levels, of this surface marker,55 suggesting that there may be a functional correlation.
PMC8078281	R13000	Bruton’s tyrosine kinase is expressed in hematopoietic cells such as B cells and myeloid cells, but not in T cells and plasma cells.56,57
PMC8078281	R14002	Second, while many other hematopoietic cells express BTK,56,57 the plasma proteins that derive from these cells seem to be essentially independent of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase.
PMC8078281	R23001	While it cannot be excluded that the disease severity, prior treatment history and the relatively low number of patients examined might have had an impact on our observations, we believe that these could serve as a starting point for more in-depth functional studies, for example, to characterize the effect of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors with a narrower effect on other kinases using the biomarker assay system.

PMC8385024	A00000	The role of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) in tumor cell migration has been widely studied, however, the characteristics and effects of MMP-2 in clinical sample of metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) remain poorly understood.
PMC8385024	A00004	Furthermore, we also identified a plausible association between MMP-2 up-regulation and activation of focal adhesion kinase signaling in the proteogenomic analysis of CRC patient tissues.
PMC8385024	A00005	Based on these comparative and integrative analyses, we suggest that the high invasiveness in the metastatic CRC resulted from increased secretion of MMP-2 and CD9-integrin complex mediated by focal adhesion kinase signaling activation.
PMC8385024	D00010	This suggests that MMP-2 modulates the tumor microenvironment by itself and by regulating various proteases and peptidases23,33–35.
PMC8385024	D03006	Nevertheless, based on phosphorylation status of indirect substrate of focal adhesion kinase signaling pathway, multiple kinase including SRC, mTOR and JNK exhibited the increased kinase activity score in MMP-2 high group.
PMC8385024	D04006	Therefore, these results support a hypothesis that increased MMP-2 activity enhances cellular motility by forming a positive feedback loop with the CD9-integrin complex and focal adhesion kinase signaling pathway.
PMC8385024	D05003	We demonstrated that high invasiveness, featured in CRC cells with increased secretion of MMP-2, is the result of MMP-2 activation of focal adhesion kinase signaling through the CD9-integrin complex.

PMC8385024	R09003	Since we found correlative expression profiles between MMP-2 and the CD9-integrin complex in all three kinds of proteome data, we further examined whether the activation of focal adhesion kinase signaling was also related to MMP-2 expression level.

PMC8487586	D01002	Importantly, the absence of Receptor tyrosine kinase pathway activation for PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, VEGFR2 and KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase in the majority of UC tumors and UC cell lines suggests that signaling through these pathways is unlikely to drive the aggressive behavior of UC cells.
PMC8487586	D02007	We observed that in the primary tumor samples evaluated, the profile of Receptor tyrosine kinase activation in UC cells lines was similar to that found in tumors with evidence of PDGFRα and PDGFRβ phosphorylation present in only 25% of UC cell lines evaluated.
PMC8487586	D03004	These data are concordant with our Receptor tyrosine kinase profiling results which show that RTKs targeted by TOC infrequently show evidence of phosphorylation and that inhibition of these RTKs are unlikely to have a substantial activity on UC cell proliferation or clinically meaningful benefit.
PMC8487586	D04001	In light of our data demonstrating that TOC does not appear to have a significant direct impact on UC cell line proliferation this suggests that reported clinical benefit seen in UC patients receiving TOC may be due, in part to off-target effects or inhibition of Receptor tyrosine kinase activity in cells present within the tumor microenvironment.

PMC3374609	R10002	Beta-glucuronidase is prevalent in the gut, averaging 0.03% sd.
PMC3374609	R10010	This is due exclusively to the absence of the module's input enzyme, heparanase (K07964-5), a typically eukaryotic gene family implicated in tumor metastasis [47]; the healthy commensal microbiota may thus lack this activity in order to avoid undesirable inflammatory and immune response in the gut [48].

PMC3374609	R11005	The low number of genes involved would render its detection prone to noise; however, as described below, this module is detected very consistently only in women with vaginal pH≥4.0, and then only due to either K00536 (Enzyme Class EC 1.19.6.1, nitrogenase - flavodoxin) or, in a minority of cases, K02588 (EC 1.18.6.1, nitrogenase).
PMC3374609	R12009	Specifically, pH correlated with the abundances of N-acetylgalactosamine II phosphotransferase (M00277), proline biosynthesis (M00015), and again “nitrogen fixation” (M00175), while phosphate transport (M00222), peptide/nickel transport (M00239), and lysine biosynthesis (M00016) were associated with lower pH. Species within the Lactobacilli are known to specialize in exactly these areas of nutrient uptake and carbohydrate metabolism [55], [56], and many of these differences can be observed directly within finished genomes (e.g. lysine biosynthesis is present in L. crispatus and lacking in L. gasseri[26]).
PMC3374609	R15003	Those pathways that were consistently present tended to be so broadly defined (e.g. ko02060, phosphotransferases, or ko00030, the entirety of pentose phosphate) that they provided too coarse a view with which to observe metabolic variation and niche specialization among body sites.
PMC3374609	R16005	Likewise, pyruvate metabolism includes portions of the citric acid cycle (M00173), absent from the posterior fornix and rare in the gut and skin; pyruvate oxidation (M00307), absent from the posterior fornix and rare in the gut; and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (M00310), present only in the nares and gut.
PMC3374609	R17006	In particular, six CAZy-module pairs had significant positive or negative correlations in all seven body sites: proline biosynthesis with GH5 (cellulase) and GH18 (chitinase); 2-oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase with GH28 (galacturonases) and GH97 (α-glucosidase and α-galactosidase); and glutathione transport with GH3 (β-glucosidase) and GH18.

PMC3409016	R09002	For example, in both metagenomes enzymes of three pathways involved in sulfur oxidation were detected: the Adenosine-5’-Phosphosulfate (EC 2.7.7.4, EC 1.8.99.2), the Sulfite:Cytochrome C oxidoreductase (EC 1.8.2.1) and the Sox enzyme complex (Figure ​(Figure2).2).
PMC3409016	R11001	We identified key genes for nitrification, denitrification, nitrogen fixation and nitrate ammonification, including ammonia monooxygenase (amoA), nitrate reductase (narGnapAnasA), nitrite reductase (nirKnirS), nitric oxide reductase (nor), nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), nitrogenase (nifHnifD) and assimilatory nitrite reductase (nrfAnirAnirB) in both metagenomes (Figure ​(Figure3).3).
PMC3409016	R11006	Respiratory nitrate reductase (narG) reduces nitrate to nitrite predominantly during anaerobic growth, while the nasA assimilate nitrate during aerobic growth [53].
PMC3409016	R11012	In fact, the gene encoding for ammonia monooxygenase (amoA), a key enzyme for ammonia oxidation was highly enriched in the BP metagenome (Fisher’s exact test, q < 0.05) (Table ​(Table2).2).
PMC3409016	R12003	For example, the stand-alone arsB chemiosmotic transport protein (i.e. anion channel) is enriched in the TP biofilm (Fisher’s exact test, q < 0.05), while the BP biofilm is rich in arsA enzymes (EC 3.6.3.16) (Fisher’s exact test, q < 0.05), which transform the arsB into an arsAB ATPase complex [59].
PMC3409016	R12005	with aoxB arsenite oxidase genes (EC 1.20.98.1)
PMC3409016	R14005	In this study we were able to detect the presence of putative membrane-associated ammonia monooxygenase in the BP biofilm.
PMC3409016	R14009	Thus, the lack of previous detection of amoA genes by Santo Domingo et al.[11] can be explained by the fact that the assay cannot detect the amoA in heterotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria as they were designed to amplify representatives of the autotrophic ammonia monooxygenase, for example, Nitrosomonas species [68].
PMC3409016	R15001	The reconstruction of the sulfur metabolism network showed several pathways used to oxidize the end products of sulfate reduction leading to the production of H2SO4, e.g. Sox complex, sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (sqr) and the flavocytochrome c (fccAB) in the corroded section of the pipe (Figure ​(Figure2).2).

PMC3619370	R03001	Although only half of the molecule (T-arm, acceptor stem) is similar to normal tRNAGly sequences, tRNAGlyUCA includes most of the glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GlyRS) identity elements (17): that is, particular nucleotides (U73, G1:C72, C2:G71, G3:C70, C35, C36) required for GlyRS recognition and glycylation (Fig. S3).

PMC3619370	R06001	Even though this type of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase was shown to fix CO2 in an in vivo complementation assay (21), its physiological role is in the AMP-recycling pathway involving AMP phosphorylase (DeoA) and ribose 1,5-bisphosphate isomerase (E2b2).
PMC3619370	R07006	Archaeal RubisCO is oxygen-sensitive and is found in strict anaerobes, suggesting that in order for the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase pathway to function, oral SR1 may require anaerobic or microaerophilic conditions.

PMC3798377	A00000	Intestinal proteases carry out a variety of functions in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
PMC3798377	A00001	Studies have reported that elevated enteric proteases in patients with GI disease can alter intestinal physiology, however the origin (human vs. microbial) of elevated proteases in patients with GI disease is unclear.
PMC3798377	A02000	In order to capture a wide range of fecal protease (FP) activity stool samples were collected from 30 IBS patients and 24 healthy controls.
PMC3798377	A02004	FP activity was ranked and top and bottom quartiles (n=13 per quartile) were identified as having high and low fecal protease activity, respectively.
PMC3798377	A03001	The Lactobacillales, Lachnospiraceae, and Streptococcaceae groups were positively associated with FP activity across the entire study population, whilst the Ruminococcaceae family and an unclassified Coriobacteriales family were negatively associated with fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D00004	Our study used molecular methods to identify the enteric bacterial taxa that are associated with fecal protease activity, thus adding to the knowledge of human protease activity in the human GI tract.
PMC3798377	D01008	Together, these findings indicate that individuals with high FP activity have lower numbers and diversity of bacterial species in their intestine and harbor a microbiota that is distinct from individuals with low fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D02002	The Streptococcaceae family is likely the driving force behind the association between the Lactobacillales order and fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D02005	Interestingly, members of the Streptococcus genus have been found to produce proteases with a broad range of functions [28-33].
PMC3798377	D04008	As the Ruminococcaceae family encompasses beneficial bacterial species and the Streptococcaceae family encompasses protease producers, it is tempting to speculate that a microbiota associated with low FP activity is associated with a more beneficial to the host than a microbiota with high fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D05000	Unlike previous studies that observed a significant increase in FP activity in IBS patients compared to healthy controls [6,10], we did not find a substantial difference in fecal protease activity between these groups in the current study.

PMC3798377	I01000	Protease-related genes make up approximately 2% of the mammalian genome and host proteases significantly contribute to the enzymatic content of the GI tract.
PMC3798377	I01001	However, the enteric microbiota is also a substantial source of serine, cysteine, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the intestine [4-6].

PMC4510187	D02002	These organisms, along with P. intermedia and T. denticola, have genes for β-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase (GH20) and α-fucosidase (GH29).
PMC4510187	D02003	On the other hand, the most abundant GHs in S. salivarius, which accounted for the majority of salivary species, are α-amylase, lysozyme, and sucrase (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).
PMC4510187	D02004	Our results cannot determine what percentage of the cell-bound glycoside hydrolase activities in saliva was derived from bacteria; however, the enzymes in host cells are expressed at low levels and are associated primarily with intracellular metabolism, and hence they are not excreted to a significant extent.
PMC4510187	D03001	Our results are in line with previous reports in that (i) all six GHs were present in saliva of healthy adults (16, 17) and (ii) β-d-galactosidase activity was absent in salivary supernatant, while activities of β-d-hexosaminidase and sialidase were present (18).
PMC4510187	D03002	The cell-bound form of glucosaminidase activities was consistently the highest among the measured glycoside hydrolase in our samples, both in vitro and ex vivo.
PMC4510187	D03003	β-N-Ac-glucosaminidase and glucosidase have been reported as the predominant GHs in healthy human dental plaque (13).
PMC4510187	D03004	The presence of both cell-bound and secreted forms of sialidase is also in agreement with previous reports (19, 20).
PMC4510187	D04002	The presence of secreted forms of GH, especially fucosidase and sialidase, can be explained by the modification of terminal glycoside moiety to provide a better scaffold for bacterial adhesion (21, 22).
PMC4510187	D04003	The complete lack of secreted glucosidase and galactosidase activities in saliva suggests that alternative hexose sugar production in response to external glycosides is not significantly induced.
PMC4510187	D04006	However, since the trigger for production of glycoside hydrolase is the energy requirements of the bacteria producing the enzyme, a more global benefit to the biofilm may be an example of kin discrimination (23).
PMC4510187	D04008	It is noteworthy that the secreted form of glucosidase was detected in biofilm grown in nutrient-rich sucrose medium at an earlier time point than that grown in mucin medium in our in vitro experiment.

PMC4510187	I00006	These CAZymes include glycosyltransferases and glycoside hydrolases (GHs).
PMC4510187	I00008	We speculated that the breakdown of complex, endogenous carbohydrates by glycoside hydrolase enzymes is one mechanism whereby oral microbes adapt to different carbon sources between the salivary planktonic phase, where exogenous simple sugars are generally more available, and the oral biofilm phase, where, in the absence of exogenous simple sugars, several alternative, more complex endogenous salivary glycoconjugates are the principal carbon source (8,–11).
PMC4510187	I01000	Our hypotheses for the present study were that (i) GH activities are higher under conditions where the primary carbon sources are limited to complex glycan conjugates and (ii) levels of glycoside hydrolase enzymes are higher in dental plaque than in saliva due to the shift in microbial population between saliva and plaque.
PMC4510187	I02001	Our first experiment was to test if carbohydrate availability influences GH activities in in vitro oral biofilm, followed by ex vivo experiments in which glycoside hydrolase activities were measured in saliva and overnight dental plaque.
PMC4510187	R00000	Overall, higher GH activities were found in spent mucin medium supernatant, except for glucosidase at the 24- and 48-h time points and fucosidase at the 24-h time point (Fig. 1 and Table 1 ).
PMC4510187	R00001	These two enzymes showed continuous increases in their activities for 72 h, whereas the other four GH activities peaked at 48 h. At 72 h, fucosidase, sialidase, and glucosaminidase were found to have higher activities in supernatant than in the cell-bound form (Table 1).
PMC4510187	R00002	Glucosaminidase activity was found to be the highest for both secreted and cell-bound forms among the 6 measured glycoside hydrolase, followed by galactosaminidase activity.
PMC4510187	R01005	Both cellular suspension and cell-free supernatant were assayed for glycoside hydrolase activities (Fig. 2).
PMC4510187	R02001	Secreted fucosidase, hexosaminidase, and sialidase were found in supernatant, while no activity was detected for galactosidase or glucosidase in supernatant.
PMC4510187	R02002	Secreted fucosidase activity level was equivalent with that of cell-bound form.
PMC4510187	R03005	Both cellular suspension and cell-free supernatant were assayed for glycosidase activities (Fig. 3).
PMC4510187	R04002	The ratios of the fucosidase activity of the secreted form to the cell-bound form were lower in overnight plaque than in saliva.
PMC4510187	R04003	In contrast to saliva samples, the secreted forms were observed for galactosidase and glucosidase in overnight plaque.
PMC4510187	R04004	Indeed, the highest activity observed in the secreted form was that of glucosidase, which was more than a third of the activity of its cell-bound counterpart.

PMC4606740	D03002	Two of the three variables were non-synonymous, leading to amino acid changes at protease cleavage sites, T860N at position P2 of the 2Apro cleavage site between VP1 and 2A and S1108G at position P1′ of the 3Cpro cleavage site between 2B and 2C.
PMC4606740	D03003	Previous work6 on the specificity of picornaviral proteases unveiled that glycine was uniquely required at the P1′ position of the 2Apro cleavage site, whereas 3Cpro preferentially cleaved between Glutamine-Glycine (Q–G) pairs.

PMC4782214	D03004	DNase also has the advantage of being susceptible to proteolytic cleavage by pronase or irreversible heat inactivation, which thus removes the risk of false-negative results, the need for multiple wash steps, and potential loss of target.15,26 Although DNase has been shown to have a negative effect on bacterial biofilm formation after long-term treatment, even these experiments, which used higher concentrations of DNase and far longer incubations than those used here, did not report cell death, just a slowing of replication.28 Furthermore, the sturdy nature of bacterial cell envelopes, which can remain intact hours or even days after cell death,25,29,30 combined with the very short treatment time required (10 minutes before DNase inactivation and cell lysis) does not provide sufficient time for the cells to permeate and render themselves susceptible to DNase degradation.

PMC5397411	R01005	The first two genes in the locus (VPAR_RS05490 and 5485) encode putative traffic NTPases resembling those of T2SS with the second gene product exhibiting homology to PilT proteins.
PMC5397411	R01006	Most bona fide T2SS do not encode a second traffic NTPase, whereas this is a common feature of type IV pilin biogenesis loci in both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria (Chen and Dubnau, 2004; Giltner et al., 2012).
PMC5397411	R01009	This ORF is also located directly adjacent to the putative prepilin peptidase (VPAR_RS05470) likely responsible for cleaving such leader peptides (Giltner et al., 2012) (Figure ​(Figure2A).2A).
PMC5397411	R03005	All of the putative competence loci found among these organisms exhibit synteny and encode two copies of traffic NTPases with the second copy bearing homology to pilT genes (Figure ​(Figure4),4), which is highly suggestive of a similar role in DNA uptake.

PMC5405715	A00003	The strains were further profiled by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting a choice of virulence genes (rib-like, cshA-like, gtfR, int, pitA, hylA).
PMC5405715	D02019	In addition, they found that most of these strains also do not produce IgA1 protease.
PMC5405715	D03005	Interestingly, only AZ_3a contains a collection of close homologues of S. pneumoniae virulence genes, in particular those coding for pneumolysin Ply together with autolysin LytA, cholin-binding protein CbpG, and hyaluronidases HylA/HysA (the latter three, however, are also found in a few other strains).
PMC5405715	D06002	However, though closely related, S. oralis and S. tigurinus can be genetically and phenotypically separated by the presence or absence of gtfR and dextran, as well as IgA protease production.
PMC5405715	I03002	Furthermore, by applying S. tigurinus– and virulence factor–specific polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), the prevalence, abundance, and virulence of this species in saliva and on buccal mucosal membranes of 35 healthy adults were determined.
PMC5405715	R05006	These virulence factors include: cbpG, coding for a pneumococcal cholin binding serine protease with adhesive properties; hylA and hysA homologues, coding for hyaluronidases; the pneumolysin-gene ply, coding for a pore-forming toxin; and the autolysin-gene lytA, coding for a peptidoglycan hydrolase.
PMC5405715	R05007	On the other hand, all typical (sensu stricto) S. oralis strains differ from S. tigurinus(–like) not only in the presence of gtfR (here identified as a gtfD–gtfG homologue), but also in zmpC, encoding a zinc-metalloproteinase involved in neutrophil extravasation, inflammation, and tissue remodeling, and in possessing iga encoding an immunoglobulin A1 protease, both typically found in S. pneumoniae.
PMC5405715	R07001	To confirm that gftR-positive strains actually do produce dextran by glycosyltransferase activity, a Mitis Salivarius Agar or Columbia Blood Agar medium was enriched with 5% sucrose.
PMC5410709	D12006	The posterior insula was also associated with abundance of a subunit of butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase, an enzyme used by intestinal bacteria such as Faecalibacterium in the final step of butyrate synthesis [73, 74].
PMC5410709	D12007	Butyrate has histone deacetylase activity and signals through GRP43 and GRP109a (expressed by enterochromaffin cells, vagal afferents, and microglia), all potential mechanisms by which it could influence brain function or structure [75].

PMC5410709	R22008	Of these, we focused on two metagenes enriched in IBS1 that are involved in neurotransmitter metabolism—4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, which degrades γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and glutamate dehydrogenase, which mediates glutamate synthesis/breakdown—and on two metagenes enriched in IBS1 that are involved in short chain fatty acid metabolism—acetate co-A transferase subunit B, which mediates the final step of butyrate synthesis, and propionate catabolism operon regulatory protein, which regulates an operon of propionate catabolism genes (Fig. 5a).
PMC5410709	R22010	This highlighted a prominent role for one particular taxon, an unclassified Peptostreptococcaceae, which had a trend toward significant correlation (p = .058) with the right inferior segment of the circular sulcus though it fell short of significance as compared to the metagene encoding 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (p = .008) (Fig. 5b).

PMC5433236	A01000	In order to examine the TMA-forming potential of microbial communities, we established databases for the key genes of the main TMA-synthesis pathways, encoding choline TMA-lyase (cutC) and carnitine oxygenase (cntA), using a multi-level screening approach on 67,134 genomes revealing 1107 and 6738 candidates to exhibit cutC and carnitine oxygenase, respectively.
PMC5433236	D01004	However, the yeaW gene displays close sequence identity (74%) to the carnitine oxygenase model sequence from A. baumannii and is arranged in similar operons that additionally encode a reductase (yeaX and cntB, respectively) as well as a betaine/carnitine/choline transporter, and for both enzymes, promiscuity to transform carnitine and butyrobetaine at similar rates was shown (yeaW/X was reported to act on choline and to a lesser extent on betaine as well).
PMC5433236	D02005	Nevertheless, some sequences comprised in our databases are not expected to be amplified, as the carnitine oxygenase forward primer does not match a few Betaproteobacteria, and in the case of cutC, a few sequences observed in Streptococcus show ≥2 mismatches with the reverse primer.
PMC5433236	D05000	TMA formation via cntA represents a distinctive branch of TMA synthesis where, next to the enzyme’s distinct substrate spectrum compared with the choline TMA-lyase, ecophysiologic features of its key player, E. coli, are substantially different to those of the major cutC-exhibiting taxa.
PMC5433236	D05003	In fact, results of the two pathways did not correlate, which is highlighted by two samples derived from the HMP dataset that display exceptionally high amounts of carnitine oxygenase, but only minute cutC abundances (Fig. 4).

PMC5433236	M00013	For carnitine oxygenase, phylogeny was applied as an additional filter to the HMM score and 43 sequences (34 unique proteins; including S. newyorkensis) that displayed HMM similarities above the set cutoff were omitted yielding 6738 genomes that exhibit 6772 candidate genes (491 unique proteins).
PMC5433236	M02009	aestuarii (DSM 17919) was used for cutC quantifications, whereas E. coli K12 (DSM 10517) DNA served as the standard for carnitine oxygenase. Results are expressed as averages of three independent experiments, normalized to the total 16S rRNA gene copies from each sample using previously described primers [22] applying an annealing temperature of 55 °C.
PMC5433236	M03004	The PCR products were purified again (PureLink PCR Purification Kit; Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) and subjected to a third amplification step that added the two indices and Illumina adapters to amplicons using PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Shigu, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PMC5433236	M03007	Amplicons were separated by gel electrophoresis, and the appropriate size was excised (cutC ~480, carnitine oxygenase ~460) and extracted with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
PMC5433236	M04005	For carnitine oxygenase, sample 3 was omitted as >99% of obtained sequences (from 13,095) failed FrameBot analysis (this sample was also on the borderline of detection in qPCR and produced only a faint band during PCR amplification).
PMC5433236	M05001	As for the amplicon analysis above, the reference set of each gene additionally included sequences that were below the set HMM threshold (500 top-scoring unique nucleotide sequences; for cutD and cntB, the threshold was defined by the lowest scoring gene that was syntenous with its partner gene; sequences derived from Bacilli located above the threshold though not considered as true carnitine oxygenase were included as well).
PMC5433236	M06003	Amplification was performed with the PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Shigu, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PMC5433236	R00003	All genes comprised in this database will be referred to as carnitine oxygenase throughout the study (see also the “Discussion” section).
PMC5433236	R01001	Additionally, synteny with the associated activator gene (cutD) as well as the reductase (cntB) that were both shown to be essential for TMA production in the corresponding pathways was investigated.
PMC5433236	R02006	However, the majority of those sequences were identical to other cntA genes in the respective genomes, and only two candidates (Klebsiella pneumoniae BIDMC 18C and Cupriavidus taiwanensis STM 6070) exhibited two non-identical carnitine oxygenase sequences.
PMC5433236	R03001	In silico analysis on coverage of developed primers suggested that a broad range of cutC and cntA gene sequences are targeted, namely 93 and 96% of all unique cutC and carnitine oxygenase genes, respectively (allowing for one mismatch in each primer).
PMC5433236	R04006	The qPCR on one third diluted samples indicated quantities of 40.6% ± 12.2% and 39.9% ± 22.2% of undiluted samples for cutC and carnitine oxygenase (five samples were on the borderline of detection), respectively, evidencing that the PCR mixtures were devoid of any interfering ingredients.
PMC5433236	R06001	A few communities additionally contained carnitine oxygenase amplicons similar to those previously detected in Citrobacter and Klebsiella.
PMC5433236	R09005	In contrast, reads indicating the presence of cntA/B were nearly identical to references (99.6% ± 1.1% and 99.8% ± 0.8% for carnitine oxygenase and cntB, respectively) and predominantly related to Gammaproteobacteria, in particular to Escherichia/Shigella and Klebsiella.
PMC5433236	R10001	Our results indicated increased abundances of bacteria exhibiting the potential to produce TMA (by about a factor of 2) in the patient group where the abundances of key genes of both pathways were elevated (median values of 0.39 and 0.11% (patient group) versus 0.22 and 0% (controls) for cutC and carnitine oxygenase, respectively, as a percentage of bacteria calculated to exhibit the genes) (Additional file 8).

PMC6024637	D00003	A recent study of mice showed that intraperitoneal butyrate administration reduced persistent lung inflammation during Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, leading to the suggestion that butyrate restores interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in the lung by inhibiting histone deacetylase.12 Anti-inflammatory properties have been described in the intestine, where butyrate through the same IL-10-dependent mechanism was associated with heightened tolerance of macrophages toward the residing microbiota.11 Finally, as butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria have been associated with promotion of T-regulatory cells and reduced incidence of graft-versus-host disease, a decrease of butyrate-producing bacteria might be associated with increased graft-versus-host disease and increased exposure to immunosuppressive agents such as steroids, which is a known risk factor for LRTI.24,25

PMC6146992	I02003	The presence of functional gallate decarboxylase activity in the identified species demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed HTS method.
PMC6146992	R00001	Food gallotannins are hydrolyzed to gallic acid by an esterase enzyme (tannase), and the gallic acid formed is decarboxylated to pyrogallol by the action of gallate decarboxylase (8, 12); these enzymes have recently been described for L. plantarum WCFS1 (7, 13, 14).
PMC6146992	R00002	Among lactic acid bacteria, L. plantarum is the prototypical species possessing tannase activity.
PMC6146992	R01004	These results are in agreement with previous studies in which tannase (12, 16) or gallate decarboxylase (7) activity among lactic acid bacteria was analyzed.
PMC6146992	R01005	Given that the latter study also revealed that, across the lactic acid bacteria assayed, gallate decarboxylase activity corresponded to the presence of the lpdC gene (7), we selected this gene to study the distribution and abundance of dietary gallate metabolism in the human gut microbiota.

PMC6146992	R09001	The gallate decarboxylase C subunit from L. plantarum WCFS1 (LpdC) is erroneously annotated as 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase (UbiD) (7).
PMC6146992	R09008	Furthermore, in the species in which the gene encoding the B subunit is clustered together with the C subunit determinant, this study revealed the existence of different gene organizations among these decarboxylases, i.e., a minority BC gene arrangement (such as in H. hathewayi, an Erysipelotrichaceae species, and Enterobacter cloacae) or a widely represented CB arrangement (in Enterococcus raffinosus, P. ethanolidurans, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, K. michiganensis, C. butyricum, and S. gallolyticus, among others) (Fig. 3).
PMC6146992	R09010	As shown in Fig. 3, some of the human gut microbiota species containing gallate decarboxylase genes also contain a tannase-encoding gene in the same region of the genome (as observed in C. butyricum, A. tropicalis, and S. gallolyticus).
PMC6146992	R09011	Similar to findings for Lactobacillus species, gallate decarboxylase-encoding genes were more common than the corresponding esterase (tannase) activity in the athlete gut microbiota samples.
PMC6146992	R09012	The presence of gallate decarboxylase but not tannase activity in some bacteria could suggest a cooperative process among commensal bacteria in dietary tannin metabolism.
PMC6146992	R09013	In addition, in the human gut microbiota, it could be imagined that other bacterial species could possess appropriate mechanisms to further degrade the pyrogallol produced by these gallate decarboxylases.
PMC6146992	R11004	The results clearly show the successful use of the HTS-lpdC method to identify functional gallate decarboxylases in complex microbial communities and the subsequent use of this gene in a phylogenetic approach to investigate the gut microbiome according to activities involved in the metabolism of a relevant dietary component.
PMC6146992	R11009	In this regard, the results shown in this work indicate that gallate decarboxylase activity, which is key for metabolism of the gallates present in plant-derived foods, is present in members of the main genera in the human gut, and this feature could be an advantage for surviving in this environment.

PMC6343685	D02000	Intestinal microecosystem and lipid metabolism are interrelated and interact with each other.34 Intestinal dysbacteriosis, such as changes in abundance and composition of Bacillus bifidus, Lactobacillus and Enterococcus can lead to lipid metabolic disturbance35,36 by regulating and influencing the activity of cholesterol oxidase and hepatic fat synthase, redistribution of triglycerides and cholesterol in liver and blood, and enterohepatic circulation of cholate.37–39 On the other hand, high-fat diet and abnormal lipid metabolism can disrupt the balance in intestinal microorganisms by decreasing the intestinal energy and nutrient absorption, changing the redox state and influencing the microenvironment of intestinal microorganisms.40,41

PMC6593728	I01001	As one of the most virulent pathogenicity islands genes, CagA is able to perturb multiple host signaling pathways by acting as a hub or extrinsic scaffold protein, in turn potentiating malignant transformation.9 CagA can interact with multiple cell components and activate multiple signaling molecules downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase growth factors, therefore causing a set of complex cellular alterations, for example, enhanced proliferation and attenuated apoptosis, changes in epithelial cell morphology and polarity, and prevention of the assembly of apical junctions.9 A serologic response to CagA in H pylori‐infected patients was found to be strongly associated with peptic ulceration.10 Oncogenic potential of CagA has been proved in animal experiments.11, 12 People infected by cagA ‐positive H pylori strains have a higher risk of developing gastric carcinoma compared to those infected with cagA‐negative strins.13 CagA‐positive H pylori strains also participate in the inflammatory response, through the production of certain cytokines such as IL‐1β and IL‐8, and activation of NF‐κB.14 Thus, infection of CagA+ H pylori strains can alter both the local and systematic environments, which might consequently influence the local and distant microbiota in the host.

PMC6595763	D04001	As one might know, fucose is component of mucin in the gut epithelial barrier; hence, the enrichment of fucose permease in IBS-D may alter the normal function of the barrier, which is reported to be associated with bacterial conglutination and invasion against host cells.[53,54] It also implied that with the barrier thinner, the increased fucose synthase of gut microbiota in IBS-D provides a protection to the host.

PMC6765283	D02003	This finding, indicated by the requirements for cytochrome bd, CydDC, and the NADH:ubiquinone reductase, supports data that the abscess, at least in part, is an aerobic environment (19, 39, 40).
PMC6765283	M10001	Insertion site assignments were corrected for polymerase slippage using a custom script to collapse reads mapping within 1 bp onto local maxima using the slippage.sh and slippage.py scripts (19).
PMC6765283	R06001	ACT75_RS08345, a putative molybdenum cofactor guanylyltransferase, was not essential in monoinfection but became essential in coinfection with Actinomyces oris.
PMC6765283	R06004	Second, we compared our Tn-seq data to a previous analysis of an ATP synthase mutant in monoinfection and coinfection with Streptococcus gordonii (19).
PMC6765283	R09009	Among these were cydA and cydB, which encode components of the cytochrome bd complex, the sole aerobic respiratory oxidase in A. actinomycetemcomitans.
PMC6765283	R09011	Finally, genes encoding the C and D subunits of the NADH:ubiquinone reductase [Na(+)-transporting], which is involved in respiratory metabolism, were core essential genes.
PMC6765283	R09012	In addition, 3 genes encoding components of the spermidine/putrescine ABC transporter and 3 genes encoding proteins involved in the Tol-Pal system were always essential in coinfection.
PMC6765283	R13002	The 4 additional components of the NADH:ubiquinone reductase [Na(+)-transporting] were accessory essential genes required in the majority of conditions.
PMC6765283	R13005	In contrast, A. actinomycetemcomitans required no additional genes encoding the ATP synthase in coinfection with S. cerevisiae, and only 2 genes with Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae.
PMC6765283	R13008	Finally, the gene encoding ArcA, a regulator activated in anaerobic conditions, was essential with 13 coinfection microbes that range from obligate aerobes to obligate anaerobes, and the gene encoding superoxide dismutase was essential in 11 of 26 conditions, indicating increased oxygen stress during coinfection with some microbes.
PMC6765283	R16004	In addition, a gene annotated to encode a toxin-activating lysine-acyltransferase was only essential in monoinfection and in coinfection with Filifactor alocis.
PMC6765283	R16005	The putative product of this gene, LtxC, is an acetyltransferase thought to activate the A. actinomycetemcomitans virulence factor RTX toxin, leukotoxin (LtxA) (36).
PMC6765283	R17002	Therefore, adhesion and ATP synthase are not as critical for A. actinomycetemcomitans survival in the presence of these microbes in the murine abscess model, and A. actinomycetemcomitans has a reduced need to synthesize DNA building blocks.
PMC6765283	R18004	It is notable that the only coinfection condition where neither identified component of pyruvate dehydrogenase becomes essential is coinfection with B. cenocepacia.
PMC6765283	R18006	In addition, tatA and tatC were coinfection-specific essential genes and essential in 15 and 14 conditions, respectively, indicating that the twin-arginine translocase is important in many coinfections.
PMC6765283	R19006	A. actinomycetemcomitans carbon metabolism is likely also altered in the presence of these 3 strains, as a number of genes involved in the TCA cycle and genes encoding a 1-phosphofructokinase and subunits of mannose and fructose PTS transporters are induced CoDE genes in these conditions.
PMC6766885	M03001	For 16S sequencing analysis, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicons were prepared using primers that consisted of sequences targeting the V3 and V4 region of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and Illumina adapter overhung nucleotide sequences as follows: Forward 5′‐TCGTCGGCAGCGTCAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGCCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG‐3′; Reverse 5′‐GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGAGATGTGTATAAGAGACAGGACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC‐3′.

PMC6775324	R02002	While, in neuron specific enolase group, the dominant microbiota were Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides, Ruminococcaceae (phylum Firmicutes), Lachnospiraceae, Phascolarctobacterium, Akkermansia, Prevotella, Cetobacterium (phylum Fusobacteria), Veillonella and Dialister of 112 genera.
PMC6775324	R03004	The J index was also significantly different between neuron specific enolase (or CEA) group and control (39.4028 P=0.0217 and 33.07955 P=0.0437, respectively) (Figure ​(Figure2A).2A).
PMC6775324	R05003	In addition, periplasmic component (COG1879), ATPase component (COG 1129) and permease components (COG1172) of ABC-type transport system were significantly less abundant in lung cancers than healthy control, which promote utilization of glucose, ribose/galactoside to regulate the energy.

PMC7019425	R00006	These complex oligosaccharides must be decomposed to drive the fructose 6-phosphate phosphoketolase-dependent glycolytic pathway (bifid shunt) for catabolism.
PMC7019425	R00007	To this end, Bifidobacterium has evolved several glycosidases and a phosphorylase with high specificities for host-derived glycans (HMOs and mucin O-glycans).
PMC7019425	R01000	Two-types of fucosidases are necessary to hydrolyze fucosidic linkages found in HMOs: 1,2-α-l-fucosidase and 1,3-1,4-α-l-fucosidase.
PMC7019425	R01001	1,2-α-l-Fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.63) is classified into the glycoside hydrolase family 95 (GH95)
PMC7019425	R01002	[27,55], while 1,3-1,4-α-l-fucosidase (EC 3.2.1.51) belongs to the GH29 subfamily B [56].
PMC7019425	R01008	GH29 subfamily B α-l-fucosidase is unique in that it requires a branched Gal residue for the hydrolysis of fucosidic linkage.
PMC7019425	R02000	Sialidases (EC 3.2.1.18) from bifidobacteria, which belong to GH33, act on both α-2,3 and α-2,6 linkages found in sialylated HMOs (Supplementary Figure S2), whereas the enzyme from B. bifidum (SiaBb2) shows a preference for the α-2,3 linkage over the α-2,6 linkage [42]; the enzyme from B. infantis (NanH2) hydrolyzes both linkages almost equally [50].
PMC7019425	R03000	Lacto-N-biosidase (EC 3.2.1.140) hydrolyzes LNT to produce LNB and lactose (Lac) (Supplementary Figure S2).

PMC7019425	R08007	However, studies on HMO transporters are still behind compared to the aforementioned glycosidases involved in the decomposition of HMOs.
PMC7019425	R09000	The GNB/LNB transporter was first isolated and identified to be responsible for the uptake of LNB that is extracellularly liberated from LNT by lacto-N-biosidase (LnbB from B. bifidum and LnbX from B. longum)
PMC7019425	R09001	[43,44] and for the uptake of GNB that is liberated from mucin O-glycans by endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase [63].

PMC7019425	R17002	B. breve commonly possesses an intracellular GH95 α-l-fucosidase, albeit that the prevalence of FL1-BP (4% occurrence) and FL2-BP (8% occurrence) is remarkably low.
PMC7019425	R19000	Extracellular GH136 lacto-N-biosidase (LnbX) is detected for 38% of B. longum genomes (151 examined) (Figure 2).
PMC7019425	R19001	LnbX-positive strains use GNB/LNB-BP (GltA) for LNB uptake and GNB/LNB phosphorylase (LnpA) for subsequent intracellular phosphorolysis, while LnbX-negative strains use LNT β-1,3-galactosidase for hydrolysis of LNT inside the cells.
PMC7019425	R19002	GltA, LNB phosphorylase, GH42 LNT β-1,3-galactosidase, GH2 β-1,4-galactosidase (Bga2A homolog), and GH20 β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Blon_0732 homolog) are highly conserved in B. longum, which is in agreement with the fact that this species commonly uses LNB and LNT [32,58,65,67].
PMC7019425	R19003	Consistent with the observation that B. longum strains that are capable of utilizing fucosylated HMOs are rare, we found that the prevalence of FL2-BP (3% occurrence) and α-l-fucosidases (≤3%) was quite low.
PMC7019425	R21001	About half of the strains of those examined for this species were capable of assimilating LNB, as mentioned above [67], but lacked the GNB/LNB phosphorylase gene homolog.
PMC7019425	R21003	The FL2-BP (13%) and GH95 α-l-fucosidase (13%) homologs were sporadically detected, which is consistent with the report that several strains of this species utilize 2′-FL, 3-FL, and LDFT mixture as the carbon source [12].

PMC2682768	I01002	There is growing evidence to suggest that common variants contributing to variation in FG are largely distinct from those associated with major disruptions of beta-cell function that predispose to T2D. Common sequence variants in the glucokinase (glucokinase) promoter4–6, and around genes encoding the islet specific glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC2)5,6 and the glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR)7–9 have each been associated with individual variation in FG levels, but have, at best, weak effects on T2D risk8,10.

PMC2860887	R14003	We also found no evidence for any interactions between either CPS1 rs7422339 or Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T genotype and folate levels to suggest their genotypic effects are stronger in those with lower reported intake levels of folate.

PMC3000799	D02001	The same polymorphisms of GRIA1 that we found associated with asparaginase allergy are associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disease.(32, 33) All the genetic variations we identified in GRIA1 were in intronic sequences.

PMC3000799	R02000	We analyzed the association between germline 364,033 SNP genotypes and asparaginase allergy in the discovery cohort of 322 patients (Supplemental Figure S1, Supplemental Table S2).
PMC3000799	R03007	There was not an association between these genotypes and the severity of asparaginase allergy (≧ grade 2 vs. < grade 2, p = 0.61, by linear regression model).

PMC3033185	D03003	The gene product (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 7, PC7/8) is a convertase similar to furin (PCSK3) that belongs to a family of proteases acting on various physiological pathways and having functional overlap in many but not all circumstances (19).
PMC3033185	D04000	First, furin and/or furin-like convertases function in iron homeostasis by generating soluble haemojuvelin (sHJV) from cellular haemojuvelin (20,21).

PMC3033185	D05000	Alternatively, however, PCSK7 may be involved more directly in sTfR release from membrane-bound TfR. Indeed, sTfR is shed from the cell surface by proteolytic cleavage, primarily mediated by a metalloprotease, which is likely activated by a furin-like convertase, as the activation is sensitive to inhibitors of these convertases (26).

PMC3157552	R03001	SNPs rs1412444 and rs2246833, located on chromosome 10q23.31 in intronic regions of the LIPA (Lysosomal Acid Lipase A) gene, showed a strong association with expression of the LIPA transcript itself (P=1.3×10-96 and P=4.0×10-96, respectively; Figure 2B and Table 3).
PMC3157552	R03004	A “platform validation” was conducted in 119 monocytic samples using qRT-PCR analyses and the association of LIPA SNPs with lipase/cholesteryl esterase transcripts was successfully replicated (rs1412444: P=3.87×10-8, rs2246833: P=1.52×10-8; see also Supplementary Figure 2).

PMC3196893	A00000	Serum butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) activity is associated with obesity, blood pressure and biomarkers of cardiovascular and diabetes risk.
PMC3196893	A00008	We conclude that variation in butyrylcholinesterase activity is due to multiple variants across the spectrum from uncommon/large effect to common/small effect, and partly results from (rather than causes) metabolic abnormalities.
PMC3196893	D00005	The concept of genetic effects on BCHE activity mediated through metabolic risk is supported by the suggestive associations between loci previously reported to affect obesity, glucose homeostasis or plasma lipids and butyrylcholinesterase activity, and by the results of Mendelian randomization analysis.
PMC3196893	D01010	For the purposes of examining whether BCHE SNPs affect the metabolic variables correlated with butyrylcholinesterase enzyme activity, the K variant and all other variants associated with it were taken as a group and the absence of positive results makes it unnecessary to determine which is or are causal.
PMC3196893	D02001	The ABI2 gene has no obvious connection with cholinesterase activity, coding for a tumour suppressor and cell migration inhibitor.

PMC3196893	D03001	It may be involved in post-translational modification of proteins (26) and since butyrylcholinesterase is synthesized as a precursor protein which needs to be processed before secretion, there may be a necessary role for aminopeptidase B.
PMC3196893	D04001	The relevance for butyrylcholinesterase activity is obscure, though it has been claimed that UGT1A1 variants may decrease oxidative stress and fatty liver through the antioxidant effect of increased bilirubin concentration (27).
PMC3196893	D05001	Factor analysis showed that butyrylcholinesterase activity clustered with the measured metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, as seen from the factor loadings for phenotypes which are known to predict risk of cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes (Fig. 1).

PMC3196893	D07002	The negative results for this and for the other significant loci (Supplementary Material, Table S4), consistent with those previously reported for glucose and insulin-related measures in Danish subjects (30), show that variation in these metabolic risk factors is not caused by variation in butyrylcholinesterase activity.

PMC3196893	R00002	Significant correlations were also found between butyrylcholinesterase activity and BMI, LDL-C, triglycerides and ALT in the Adolescent Study, but the correlations were less than in the adults and there was evidence of significant heterogeneity of the correlations between adults and adolescents.
PMC3196893	R01001	The clustering of factor loadings for BCHE activity and these correlated variables for two unrotated principal components (PCs) are shown in Figure 1; butyrylcholinesterase is located close to the lipids, BMI, glucose and insulin, urate and C-reactive protein.
PMC3196893	R02004	The differing distributions for butyrylcholinesterase activity in adults and adolescents are shown in Supplementary Material, Figure S1.
PMC3196893	R04001	These SNPs were at or near the butyrylcholinesterase gene (Chr 3), RNPEP1 (Chr 1) and ABI2 (Chr 2).
PMC3196893	R05006	Significant and independent SNP associations accounted for ∼22% of total variation in butyrylcholinesterase activity in the combined data.
PMC3196893	R06000	Apart from rs1803274 (the K-variant), which showed a minor allele frequency of 0.21 in our data, butyrylcholinesterase deficiency variants were uncommon.
PMC3196893	R07005	This showed that the associations between BCHE activity and BMI or triglycerides were not attenuated by adjustment for the K variant; this is the outcome expected if the K variant affects butyrylcholinesterase activity but not BMI or triglycerides.
PMC3196893	R08002	Nineteen SNPs at eight of the loci (see Supplementary Material, Table S5) showed associations with butyrylcholinesterase at P < 0.01
PMC3196893	R09012	We then compared the observed effects of FTO or GCKR variants on butyrylcholinesterase activity with those expected given the FTO-BMI and BMI-BCHE associations, or the GCKR-triglycerides and triglycerides-BCHE associations.
PMC3196893	R10003	These results showed that the associations between FTO or GCKR variants and BCHE activity were partly mediated by the associations between triglycerides or BMI and butyrylcholinesterase activity.

PMC3499946	A00000	Diminished serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities (measures of paraoxonase-1 [PON-1] function) in humans have been linked to heightened systemic oxidative stress and atherosclerosis risk.
PMC3499946	A01001	Low serum arylesterase and paraoxonase activities were both associated with increased risk for MACE, with arylesterase activity showing greatest prognostic value (Q4 versus Q1, Hazard Ratio [HR] 2.63, 95%CI 1.97–3.50, p<0.01).
PMC3499946	A01002	Arylesterase remained significant after adjusting for traditional risk factors, C-reactive protein, and creatinine clearance (HR 2.20, 95%CI 1.60–3.02, p<0.01), predicted future development of MACE in both primary and secondary prevention populations, and reclassified risk categories incrementally to traditional clinical variables.
PMC3499946	A01003	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified distinct SNPs within the PON-1 gene that were highly significantly associated with serum paraoxonase (1.18×10−303) or arylesterase (4.99×10−116) activity but these variants were not associated with either 3-year MACE risk in an angiographic cohort (n=2,136) or history of either coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction in the CARDIoGRAM consortium (n~80,000 subjects).

PMC3499946	D00000	Paraoxonase-1 is an atherosclerosis protective enzyme associated with HDL and systemic anti-oxidant function.
PMC3499946	D00001	Its catalytic activity within crude serum mixtures has traditionally been measured by quantifying enzymatic hydrolysis rates of two known in vitro substrates, with functional activities named paraoxonase and arylesterase activities4, 5.
PMC3499946	D00003	First, we demonstrated prognostic value of serum arylesterase activity (and to a lesser extent serum paraoxonase activity) in predicting long-term cardiovascular risk in a wide range of subjects already treated with contemporary medical therapy.
PMC3499946	D00007	Moreover, the ability of low serum arylesterase activity to identify those at significant increased risk of MACE, even among primary prevention subjects with recent coronary angiographic data showing < 50% stenosis in all major coronary vessels, suggests this assay has prognostic value, and can identify a vulnerable cohort of subjects who otherwise are not identified as being at high risk.
PMC3499946	D00008	Taken together, the present results suggest that enzymatic activity measures with arylesterase, more so than paraoxonase, serve as a powerful prognostic indicator of cardiovascular risk in a broad spectrum of subjects.
PMC3499946	D01000	Studies on PON-1 activities have relied on quantifying its wide ranges of enzymatic activities in breaking down in vitro substrates like paraoxon (paraoxonase activity) and phenylacetate (arylesterase activity).
PMC3499946	D01002	Hence, the distinction between serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities in predicting future adverse cardiac events is somewhat unexpected, even though historically the correlation between these two measures has not been particularly tight.
PMC3499946	D01003	The unique relationship between the two PON-1 activity measurements is largely the result of a very strong association between serum paraoxonase activity and its underlying genetic determinants, which may also explain why serum arylesterase activity is normally distributed while serum paraoxonase activity was not.
PMC3499946	D01004	Meanwhile, the strong association between the PON gene cluster and serum arylesterase activity confirms the long-standing assumption that this locus harbors important genetic determinants of serum arylesterase activity.
PMC3499946	D02001	First, there was a stronger relationship between serum paraoxonase activity levels and its genetic determinants than those with serum arylesterase activity.
PMC3499946	D02002	Second, our results confirm the strong association of PON-1 variants with serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities and demonstrate that the two measured enzymatic functions are associated in a Mendelian-like fashion by a single, major locus on chromosome 7 containing the PON gene cluster.
PMC3499946	D02005	However, while the PON-1 variants exhibited strong (if not opposed) effects on PON function, they were not associated with future risk of MACE, either individually or as a haplotype that modestly decreased both paraoxonase and arylesterase activity.
PMC3499946	D03001	It is of interest that the PON-1 transgenic mouse models demonstrating protective effects have 50–400% increased serum arylesterase activity 15, 16, far in excess of the modest changes in activity associated with the peak SNP identified in the arylesterase GWAS.
PMC3499946	D03004	It is thus possible that the genetic effects on arylesterase activity from this SNP are too weak to observe, especially if a minimum biological threshold of activity change is needed to influence risk of prevalent CAD, history of MI, or incident risk of MACE.
PMC3499946	D04004	Of note, we did not find a strong relationship between systemic inflammatory biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein or leukocyte parameters, with serum arylesterase levels in this group of stable cardiac patients.
PMC3499946	D05001	Serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities utilized substrates that are not the endogenous substrates for PON-1, but are used because they are not readily influenced by other esterases/lactonases in serum, and are presumed to reflect the underlying catalytic activity of PON-1.
PMC3499946	D05002	The GWAS results observed demonstrate these assumptions are reasonable, as only genetic variations in the PON-1 gene were observed to be associated with variations in paraoxonase and arylesterase activities.
PMC3499946	D05004	Hence, we are unable to determine the variability and prognostic value of level changes over time and the impact of dietary or therapeutic interventions on serum arylesterase activity level.

PMC3499946	I00002	Paraoxonase-1 (EC 3.1.1.2) activity in serum is classically named after the substrate used to monitor enzymatic function, namely, paraoxonase activity (using paraoxon as substrate) and arylesterase activity (using phenyl acetate as substrate) 6.
PMC3499946	I00006	In addition, we sought to identify genetic loci controlling paraoxonase and arylesterase activity by carrying out an unbiased genome-wide association study (GWAS) and determine whether these genetic factors were associated with incident risks of adverse cardiac events or prevalent coronary artery disease (CAD).
PMC3499946	M03001	For serum paraoxonase activity, the rate of generation of para-nitrophenol was determined at 405 nm in 40-fold diluted serum (final) in reaction mixtures compose of 1.5mM paraoxon (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri), 10mM Tris hydrocholoride, pH 8, 1M sodium chloride, and 2mM calcium chloride at 24°C.
PMC3499946	M03004	The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variance for the high throughput paraoxonase activity assay were 1.9% and 3.3%, respectively, on 30 replicates performed on 15 different days.
PMC3499946	M03005	For serum arylesterase activity measurement, initial hydrolysis rates were determined at 270 nm in 50-fold diluted serum (final) in reactions mixtures composed of 3.4mM phenylacetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri),
PMC3499946	M03008	The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variance for arylesterase activity assay were 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, on 20 replicates performed on 10 different days.
PMC3499946	M06000	Genome-wide linear regression analyses were used to identify loci associated with serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activity after adjustment for age and gender under an additive model.
PMC3499946	R00004	Compared to those in the highest quartile, subjects in the lowest quartile of serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activity were more likely to have significantly obstructive (≥50% stenosis) coronary artery disease (odds ratio 1.86 [95% CI 1.53, 2.27] p<0.01 for arylesterase, and 1.48 [95% CI 1.22, 1.81] p<0.01 for paraoxonase).
PMC3499946	R00006	In addition, there were very weak (but statistically significant) correlations between serum arylesterase activity and hsCRP (r=−0.09, p<0.001), estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl, r= 0.15, p<0.001), and absolute lymphocyte count (r=0.09, p<0.001).
PMC3499946	R00007	In contrast, there was no statistically significant relationship between serum arylesterase activity and leukocyte count (r=0.02, p=0.28) or absolute neutrophil count (r=0.002, p=0.91).
PMC3499946	R01008	The addition of serum arylesterase activity or serum paraoxonase activity to the model results in significant improvement in risk classification with net reclassification index (NRI) of 7.9% for arylesterase activity (p=0.003) and 7.2% for paraoxonase activity (p=0.002).
PMC3499946	R01010	Serum arylesterase activity also remained a prognostic indicator within each Framingham risk factor sub-cohort and among those with low hsCRP
PMC3499946	R01012	In addition to serum arylesterase remaining a significant predictor of MACE after addition of higher sensitivity troponin testing to traditional risk factors and laboratory risk markers in the models, we further observed an increased risk of developing subclinical myocardial necrosis (troponin levels that are detectable but remain below the 99th percentile diagnostic cutoff among healthy subjects used to define cutoff for MI) with decreasing quartiles of serum arylesterase levels (odds ratio 2.01
PMC3499946	R01013	[95%CI 1.53–2.64], p<0.001, Figure 3) – this trend was not observed with serum paraoxonase activity levels (Figure 3).
PMC3499946	R02008	For example, the lead SNP for serum arylesterase activity, rs854572, is located in the promoter region of PON-1 and yielded a highly significant p value of p=4.99 × 10−116 (Table 3).
PMC3499946	R02014	Since BMI and statin use have been shown to potentially affect serum paraoxonase activity11–13, we also adjusted the genetic analyses for these potential confounders.
PMC3499946	R02016	Thus, the effect of the lead SNPs on paraoxonase and arylesterase activities are robust and independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
PMC3499946	R03000	Given the strong effect of the chromosome 7 locus on PON-1 function, we also carried out GWAS analyses for paraoxonase and arylesterase activity conditioned on the lead SNP for each respective trait.
PMC3499946	R03002	To gain further insight into the effect of the chromosome 7 variants on PON-1 function, we also examined the relationship between serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities in our cohort.
PMC3499946	R03005	However, such a pattern was not observed with the three genotype groups of the lead SNP for serum arylesterase activity (rs854572; G>C, Figure 5B).
PMC3499946	R04003	Given the differential effects of the associated variants on PON-1 function (e.g. rs662 is associated with increase in paraoxonase activity but decrease in arylesterase activity), we also constructed haplotypes with rs662, rs854560, rs854570, and rs854572 and specifically tested the ATAG haplotype, which leads to modest decreases in both paraoxonase and arylesterase activity (data not shown).

PMC3507617	I02000	We investigated the three gene regions (MTNR1B, glucokinase, and G6PC2) shown most consistently to be associated with fasting glucose in Caucasians, across the four ethnic groups in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA).
PMC3507617	R01009	SNP rs4607517 in glucokinase demonstrated a similar magnitude of association with fasting glucose across ethnic groups (range of β coefficient from regression −1.19– −1.06) but achieved nominal significance only in HIS.

PMC3607698	D00006	Because our study was designed to test the hypothesis that inheritance might alter response to aromatase inhibitors, and because aromatase inhibitor therapy lowers the already low postmenopausal E2 concentrations studied here, we used a sensitive GC-MS/MS method to assay plasma E2 levels.

PMC3636881	R04002	BCHE encodes the enzyme butyrylcholinesterase, homozygous mutations of which confer susceptibility to prolonged apnea after administration of the muscle relaxant suxamethonium (succinylcholine) (37).
PMC3636881	R06001	However, these conditional analyses did not reveal other SNPs associated with aspirin hydrolase activity at the genome-wide threshold for significance (data not shown).
PMC3636881	R07000	Our genetic studies implicated BChE as a plasma aspirin esterase, which is supported by aspirin hydrolysis by purified BChE (27).
PMC3636881	R07001	However, Western blotting showed that partially purified material from the soluble faction of plasma contained little of the enzyme, but at least 200 ng of purified butyrylcholinesterase was required to achieve aspirin hydrolysis equivalent to that in the purified fraction (Fig. 2E).
PMC3636881	R08002	Although plasma from this individual was unable to hydrolyze the BChE substrate butyrylthiocholine (Fig. 2F), this complete loss of butyrylcholinesterase activity did not result in a corresponding loss of aspirin hydrolysis.
PMC3636881	R09001	In contrast, density gradient separation of plasma showed that aspirin esterase activity was a soluble activity and that apoA-I-containing lipoprotein particles were essentially devoid of activity (Fig.

PMC3636881	R12001	The procainamide-resistant activity (PAFAH1b2) was relatively uniform among donors, whereas the oATP-resistant activity (butyrylcholinesterase) varied among donors in concert with total activity.
PMC3636881	R13001	We found that butyrylcholinesterase readily responded to plasma, so its velocity was greater in plasma with higher endogenous activity compared with hydrolysis in plasma with slower endogenous activity.

PMC3641569	I00000	Dual Antiplatelet Therapy, including clopidogrel and aspirin, inhibits platelet function, preventing ischemic events and improving outcomes following acute coronary syndromes and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).1,2 To exert an antiplatelet effect, clopidogrel requires conversion to an active thiol metabolite (SR 26334) by hepatic cytochrome P450 (cytochrome P450) isoenzymes, which inhibit adenosine diphosphate (ADP)–stimulated platelet activation by irreversibly binding to platelet P2Y12 receptors.3-5

PMC3646656	D01009	In this light calcium regulation within immune cells has been previously identified as aberrant in certain samples of patients with CVID.29UBXN10 might be a compelling candidate potentially involved in immunopathogenesis of primary antibody failure in that it encodes an ubiquitin-like protein, which, in addition to phosphorylation, has been shown to regulate nuclear factor κB activity.30 Sphingosine-dependent protein kinase 1 (SDK1) is important in the survival of alveolar macrophages.31DEPDC6 is a negative regulator of mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathways, and RNA expression levels were found to be significantly different between those mice resistant to H5N1 influenza virus and those that were susceptible.32 No significant associations in the region of TACI were observed, and subjects with TACI mutations were not separately identified.

PMC3723315	A00000	Increased systemic levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) are associated with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD).
PMC3723315	A00009	The clinical implications for CAD and a better understanding of the functional basis for the association of CFH and MPO variants with circulating Myeloperoxidase levels require further study.
PMC3723315	D00008	Thus, while several independent alleles at the CFH locus influence multiple inflammatory-related disease phenotypes, the strong association signal at this locus with serum Myeloperoxidase levels is primarily due to rs800292 or other tightly linked variants.
PMC3723315	D01000	Complement fixation is well known as a potent trigger of leukocyte activation and degranulation, and serum generation is associated with activation of protease cascades, including complement proteins, such as C3a and C3b (31–33).
PMC3723315	D01007	In addition, clotting factors and proteases that activate complement proteins and trigger degranulation of MPO-rich phagocytes, such as neutrophils, are present in serum but are mostly depleted in plasma.
PMC3723315	D01008	Therefore, CFH and C2 variants that decrease complement activation, either through increased CFH or reduced C2 activity, could be one potential mechanism through which they lead to decreased Myeloperoxidase levels in serum.
PMC3723315	D02002	On the other hand, MPO-induced oxidative damage to lipoproteins and the vascular wall have been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis and its clinical sequelae, and systemic levels of Myeloperoxidase predict cardiovascular risk.
PMC3723315	D03005	Thus, this is consistent with our observations that the A allele of rs2814778 is associated with increased serum MPO levels since Myeloperoxidase is most abundantly present in neutrophils.
PMC3723315	D04009	Taken together, these data indicate that several SNPs at chromosome 17q22 contribute independently to circulating Myeloperoxidase levels and suggest that this locus may contain a regulatory region(s) with pleiotropic effects on gene expression.
PMC3723315	D05005	These results suggest that specific alleles in this region may control both serum and plasma Myeloperoxidase levels whereas other independent variants are associated with only levels in serum, possibly through a mechanism related to HDL metabolism.
PMC3723315	D06004	This could explain, in part, the variation seen in circulating Myeloperoxidase levels across cohorts even when using the same assay, and the observed heterogeneity in the association results for some of the identified loci.
PMC3723315	D07004	Additional studies will be needed to gain a better understanding of the functional basis for the association between circulating MPO levels and the identified variants in CFH and Myeloperoxidase, as well as to determine the clinical implications for inflammatory diseases that could be mediated in part through MPO-related activity.

PMC3756935	D01004	In addition, the MERTK and TULP1 proteins have been shown to interact during the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.36 In particular, mice lacking specifically the murine homolog of MERTK display a deficiency in the clearance of apoptotic thymocytes by macrophages.37 Interestingly, the clearance of apoptotic debris by phagocytosis can directly stimulate fibrogenesis.38,39 Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) may play a key role in this process, as they have phagocytic functions, including the NADPH oxidase activity required for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).40 HSC are also found in close proximity to hepatocytes, a key source of apoptotic debris during liver injury.41 Overall, our results suggest a possible relationship between the clearance of apoptotic cells through phagocytosis and liver fibrosis.

PMC3773907	A02003	Anti–myeloperoxidase ANCA was associated with HLA-DQ (P = 2.1×10−8).
PMC3773907	A03000	This study confirms that the pathogenesis of ANCA-associated vasculitis has a genetic component, shows genetic distinctions between granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis that are associated with ANCA specificity, and suggests that the response against the autoantigen proteinase 3 is a central pathogenic feature of proteinase 3 ANCA–associated vasculitis.
PMC3773907	A03001	These data provide preliminary support for the concept that proteinase 3 ANCA–associated vasculitis and myeloperoxidase ANCA–associated vasculitis are distinct autoimmune syndromes.
PMC3773907	D01002	A more detailed analysis taking advantage of the comprehensive coverage of the MHC locus on the Immunochip24 could be used to define this association and that between myelo-peroxidase ANCA and HLA-DQ.
PMC3773907	D02002	Specifically, both the HLA and SERPINA1 associations with granulomatosis with polyangiitis are seen in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis who are positive for proteinase 3 ANCA, not for myeloperoxidase ANCA, and can also be seen in the proteinase 3 ANCA subgroup of patients with microscopic polyangiitis.
PMC3773907	D02004	The genetic difference between proteinase 3–ANCA and myeloperoxidase-ANCA polyangiitis could have immunopathogenic and therapeutic implications (see below as well as Suppiah et al.27 and Stegeman28), and will require future genetic studies powered to detect associations with these conditions rather than with ANCA-associated vasculitis as a whole.
PMC3773907	D03001	There is strong in vitro evidence that ANCA can bind to neutrophils and drive endothelial inflammation,29 and proteinase 3 ANCA has induced vasculitis, but not granulomata, in transfer studies in mice.20 Proteinase 3 expression is increased on neutrophils in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis,30 and pathogenic mechanisms for its involvement have been suggested.31 One small study has also suggested a genetic association, though this was not replicated.32 Our study shows that variants at the MHC, SERPINA1, and PRTN3 loci confer a significant risk of proteinase 3–ANCA polyangiitis.
PMC3773907	D03003	Nonetheless, this firm association between key components of the autoimmune response — MHC, the proteinase 3 autoantigen itself, and perhaps α1-antitrypsin — puts anti–proteinase 3 autoreactivity at the center of the cause of disease, potentially resolving a long-standing controversy.
PMC3773907	D04000	Proteinase 3–ANCA polyangiitis, which is the antibody subtype of two thirds of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and one third of those with microscopic polyangiitis, is a condition in which there is genetic variation in an autoantigen itself, together with HLA, implying that antigen-specific autoimmunity plays a role in pathogenesis.
PMC3773907	D05000	SERPINA1 encodes α1-antitrypsin, a neutral serine protease inhibitor, enzymatic targets of which include proteinase 3.
PMC3773907	D06002	These data raise the possibility that, like proteinase 3–ANCA polyangiitis and consistent with in vitro and animal-model evidence,19 myeloperoxidase-ANCA polyangiitis might be driven by antimy-eloperoxidase autoimmunity.
PMC3773907	D07000	Despite having distinct genetic risk factors, proteinase 3–ANCA and myeloperoxidase-ANCA polyangiitis have overlapping clinical phenotypes.
PMC3773907	D07003	This clinical similarity between proteinase 3 ANCA and myeloperoxidase ANCA disease is likely to be augmented by shared genetic associations, which are commonly seen between distinct autoimmune diseases.40 Differences between the syndromes could be caused by additional independent genetic associations that this study has not been powered to detect.
PMC3773907	D08003	Future genetic and clinical studies of ANCA-associated vasculitis should be sufficiently powered to allow for independent analysis of proteinase 3–ANCA and myeloperoxidase-ANCA polyangiitis.

PMC3773907	I01001	The most convincing association has been with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC),7-9 especially the locus HLA DPB1*0401.10 An association has been suggested between ANCA-associated vasculitis and the rare Z (or null) allele of the serpin A1 gene (SERPINA1), which encodes α1-antitrypsin, a serine proteinase inhibitor for which proteinase 3 is one of several substrates.
PMC3773907	I03001	In vitro evidence suggests that ANCA can be proinflammatory, and transfer models of myeloperoxidase ANCA and proteinase 3 ANCA in animals mimic some aspects of disease.19,20 Thus, proteinase 3 ANCA and myeloperoxidase ANCA are potentially important in pathogenesis but nonetheless might represent epiphenomena rather than drivers of disease.
PMC3773907	R01003	Three additional SNPs not represented on the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Platform were included: the interleukin-2–receptor alpha gene (IL2RA) and the protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 22 gene (PTPN22) because of prior associations and the proteinase 3 gene (PRTN3) because it is a major ANCA autoantigen.
PMC3773907	R01004	(The other major ANCA autoantigen, myeloperoxidase, was already represented on the array.)
PMC3773907	R04000	Further subgroup analysis was performed according to proteinase 3– and myeloperoxidase-ANCA specificity.
PMC3773907	R05000	Direct comparisons between the subgroup of patients with proteinase 3 ANCA and the subgroup with myeloperoxidase ANCA showed significant differences at the MHC, SERPINA1, and PRTN3 loci, all consisting of there being a genetic association with proteinase 3 ANCA but not myeloper-oxidase ANCA (Table 2 and Fig.
PMC3773907	R05003	This was particularly clear for PRTN3, which was conclusively associated with proteinase 3 ANCA status whereas it had not been with total ANCA-associated vasculitis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Table 2).
PMC3773907	R06002	This SNP was not convincingly associated with proteinase 3 ANCA, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or microscopic polyangiitis in this cohort.
PMC3773907	R06003	However, after genotyping by means of a TaqMan assay in the replication cohort, it reached “genomewide” significance with the myeloperoxidase ANCA subgroup (odds ratio, 0.65; P = 2.1×10−8 in the combined cohort) (Table 2).
PMC3773907	R07005	The converse was true for the HLA-DQ SNP, which was associated with myeloperoxidase ANCA rather than proteinase 3 ANCA among patients with microscopic polyangiitis (Table 3).

PMC4321444	D03000	Among GW-significant SNPs mapping to BHMT-BHMT2-DMGDH, variants linked with higher blood/toenail Se have been previously associated with higher liver betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT) enzyme activity and protein level (25) and lower plasma betaine levels (26,27).
PMC4321444	D03004	As betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase is a zinc-dependent cysteine-rich enzyme, an altered thiol redox status could influence its activity in much the same way as for protein kinase C (30).
PMC4321444	D05006	Regarding the latter, we note that unlike genetic variation in the folate-dependent pathway, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase variation does not appear to impact Hcy levels (10,11,40–42) and together suggests a less dominant role of the BHMT/2 remethylation pathway in human Hcy balance, a theory which contrasts that proposed for mice (39).

PMC4354842	A00012	In summary, this first GWA study for plasma protein C levels in African Americans confirms the associations of SNPs in the protein C and PROCR regions with circulating levels of protein C across ethnic populations and identifies new candidates for protein C regulation.
PMC4354842	D00002	Our GWAS in African Americans not only replicated the protein C and the PROCR loci reported from the previously published GWAS or candidate gene studies in individuals of European descent [Aiach et al., 1999; Athanasiadis et al., 2011; Oudot-Mellakh et al., 2012; Pomp et al., 2009; Reiner et al., 2008;
PMC4354842	D01004	The locus protein C has also been previously reported in candidate gene studies
PMC4354842	D02000	Rs867186 is a missense mutation in the PROCR gene that encodes a receptor for activated protein C, endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), which is an N-glycosylated type I membrane protein.
PMC4354842	D04002	These data suggest that the associations observed at the protein C region across the different ethnic populations were attributable to the same underlying locus.
PMC4354842	D05003	While the effect size and allele frequency for rs867186 in PROCR were similar between these two ethnic groups, we noticed that at the protein C region, the frequency of protein C-increasing allele (A1 in European Americans and A2 in African Americans) was two times higher in European Americans than in African Americans.
PMC4354842	D06004	Also, LD between the secondary variants and the top protein C SNPs was lower in HapMap YRI (r2=0.006~0.014) than in CEU populations (r2=0.08~0.09).

PMC4354842	I00006	Plasma levels of protein C in individuals of European descent are influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near the protein C and PROCR genes [Aiach et al., 1999; Athanasiadis et al., 2011; Oudot-Mellakh et al., 2012;
PMC4354842	R02002	The strongest signal was observed for rs7580658, an intergenic SNP that was 16,735 bp upstream of the 5′ terminus of the protein C (protein C) gene.
PMC4354842	R03000	The second top SNP associated with protein C was rs1799808, 5′ to the protein C gene.
PMC4354880	D00008	Fifth, genetic variation in genes encoding renin and the aldosterone synthase, respectively, was not related to plasma renin concentration or activity or to aldosterone levels.
PMC4354880	D01001	The kininogen 1 gene encodes both high and low molecular weight kininogen, the precursors of bradykinin and kallidin (Lys-Bradykinin), respectively.27 The kallikrein B gene encodes plasma prekallikrein, a serine protease that, upon transformation to kallikrein, catalyzes the conversion of high molecular weight kininogen to bradykinin (Figure 5)27 and possibly other factors such as adrenomedullin and endothelin-1.28
PMC4354880	D03000	These observations are consistent with the concept that the kallikrein-kinin system and the RAAS are tightly interrelated.29 A prime example for this interaction is the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which catalyzes on one hand the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and on the other hand, degrades bradykinin.29-30
PMC4354880	D03001	In other words, the angiotensin-converting enzyme affects the concentrations of key effectors of the RAAS (i.e. angiotensin II) and the kallikrein-kinin system, (i.e. bradykinin) in opposite directions.
PMC4354880	D06000	In prior studies, genetic variation in the renin (REN) gene itself has been associated with plasma renin activity35-36 and the risk of incident hypertension.35-36 On a parallel note, genetic variation in the CYP11B2 gene, which encodes the aldosterone synthase (MIM 124080), has been related to the ratio of plasma aldosterone concentration/plasma renin activity.37 In our analyses, however, a limited number of SNPs in these two genes were not associated with plasma renin concentration, plasma renin activity or circulating aldosterone levels, respectively.
PMC4354880	D07002	Gαs is a stimulatory G-protein subunit activating the adenylate cyclase, which – upon such activation – increases intracellular cAMP levels.39-41 cAMP is an important second messenger binding e.g. to PKA, which in turn influences the transcription of multiple genes.40-41 As reviewed in detail by Kim et al., the Gαs/cAMP/PKA pathway plays a central role in the regulation of renin secretion, one of the key biomarkers of the RAAS.42 Mice with targeted deletion of Gαs in juxtaglomerular cells display lower basal renin secretion and expression42 and a blunted response to chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or AT1 receptor blockade (impaired “feedback loop”),43 indicating that Gαs signaling is highly relevant to renin secretion and expression under steady-state and dynamic conditions.42
PMC4354880	D08000	Co-administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or AT1 antagonists with inhibitors of the adenylate cyclase likewise substantially reduces renin expression as compared to ACE-inhibitors or AT1 antagonists alone.42-43 Thus, cell-specific disruption of the Gαs gene in juxtaglomerular cells and inhibition of the adenylate cyclase leads to impaired renin secretion in response to chronic blockade of the RAAS.42-43

PMC4382867	D01000	These SNPs are 927 kb to 971 kb downstream from microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 (MGST1) (Supplementary Figure 3), a member of the superfamily of Membrane-associated Proteins in Eicosanoid and Glutathione metabolism (MAPEG).
PMC4382867	D01001	MGST1 has high sequence homology to prostaglandin E synthase (MGST1L1), another homologue of the MAPEG family that shares 38% of its DNA sequences with MGST1.16 MGST1 and MGST1L1 are upregulated in several cancers, including colorectal cancer.17,18 MGST1L1 is coexpressed and functionally coupled to prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2/COX-2), and the combined activity of MGST1L1 and COX-2 increases production of proinflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which promotes carcinogenesis through several mechanisms, including stimulation of WNT signaling, an essential oncogenic pathway of colorectal cancer.19-22 An in vitro experiment has demonstrated that NSAIDs can inhibit expression of MGST1L1 and COX-2, thereby blocking COX-2 mediated synthesis of PGE2 in human colon carcinoma cells.23 Taken together, both MGST1L1 and the closely related gene MGST1 may influence NSAID-mediated inhibition of colorectal carcinogenesis partially through involvement in the PGE2-induced WNT signaling pathway.
PMC4382867	D03000	Rs2965667 is also located about 970 kb upstream from phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit type 2 gamma (PIK3C2G) (Supplementary Figure 3).

PMC4492197	I00002	However, recent reports indicate that patients receiving PEGylated Escherichia coli asparaginase can develop hypersensitivity reactions to the drug without any evidence of detectable antibodies; because IgE may be bound to mast cells and may be present for only a limited time period, it is possible that IgE plays a role in asparaginase-induced reactions but eludes detection.5
PMC4492197	I00003	Therefore, multiple pathways of asparaginase hypersensitivity are possible and currently they are not well understood.
PMC4492197	I01002	Our recent study investigating the role of HLA-DRB1 genes on asparaginase hypersensitivity in 1870 patients of European ancestry identified an association with the HLA-DRB1*07:01 allele.7 However, additional agnostic genome-wide studies that encompass the racial diversity of patients with ALL are required to better understand the risk and the mechanisms of asparaginase hypersensitivity.
PMC4492197	I02001	We used a genome-wide association approach, including a focus on exonic variants in addition to noncoding variants, to identify genetic loci associated with asparaginase hypersensitivity.
PMC4492197	R00000	Hypersensitivity reaction data to native E coli asparaginase or PEGylated E coli asparaginase were available from a total of 3308 pediatric ALL patients enrolled on 5 different protocols (Table 1).
PMC4492197	R01002	Protocols including native E coli asparaginase had a higher frequency of hypersensitivity than those using PEGylated E coli asparaginase (35.1% vs 11.6%; Table 2).
PMC4492197	R01005	Patients with T-cell ALL were only enrolled on SJCRH protocols; within the standard/high-risk arms of these studies, there were more asparaginase hypersensitivity reactions among patients with B-lineage compared with those with T-cell ALL receiving identical treatment (supplemental Figure 1; P = .001).
PMC4492197	R01006	Asparaginase preparation was confounded with protocol, but it also associated with hypersensitivity in multivariate analysis (P = 7.2 × 10−45) when removing protocol as a covariate from the regression model.
PMC4492197	R02002	Focusing on nonsynonymous SNPs, the minor allele at rs17885382 in the HLA-DRB1 gene (P = 3.23 × 10−26, OR = 1.63; Figure 1A,C) had the strongest association with asparaginase hypersensitivity.
PMC4492197	R03002	The association was also present across all protocols (supplemental Figure 2B) and with both asparaginase preparations (supplemental Figure 2C).
PMC4492197	R05001	The effect size was most pronounced in patients of European ancestry (P = 5.9 × 10−5, OR = 1.68; supplemental Figure 3A), but elevated in other ancestries, for all treatment protocols, and for both asparaginase preparations (supplemental Figure 3A-C).
PMC4492197	R06003	Consistent with our previous analysis, the HLA-DRB1 rs17885382 variant was in linkage disequilibrium with the HLA-DRB1*07:01 allele (R2 = 0.94); therefore, it is likely that the haplotype is driving the association between rs17885382 and asparaginase hypersensitivity.
PMC4492197	R07005	Similar results were found taking the preparation of asparaginase into consideration.
PMC4492197	R07006	Patients receiving native E coli asparaginase carrying both risk alleles had an incidence of allergy of 50% compared with 32% among noncarriers of risk alleles, whereas patients receiving PEGylated E coli asparaginase had an incidence of allergy of 47% compared with 10% among noncarriers.
PMC4492197	R08002	Therefore, the pathway analysis suggests that genetic variants within genes involved in T-cell function may play a role in the development of asparaginase hypersensitivity.

PMC4501476	I10000	The fourth strongest evidence for an association was for rs6010620 (OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.21–1.35; P = 2.52 × 10−12), localizing to intron 12 (61,780,283 bp) of the RAD3-like helicase gene RTEL1 (ref 28) and mapping within a 65-kb region of LD at 20q13.33 (Fig. 2 and Table 1).

PMC4525478	I09000	We postulated that the cancer-associated sequence variants in the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene might be associated with shorter telomeres.
PMC4525478	I12002	Further investigations of the potential effects of genetic variants at the 5p15.33 locus on the functions and expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase and CLPTM1L are clearly warranted.

PMC4526392	A00000	O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) is a DNA repair enzyme that protects cells from carcinogenic effects of alkylating agents; however, MGMT is silenced by promoter hypermethylation during carcinogenesis.
PMC4526392	A00004	We found that the predisposition to MGMT methylation arising from the 15q15.2 locus involved regulation of the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component UBR1.
PMC4526392	A00006	Overall, our results substantiate reduced gene transcription as a major mechanism for predisposition to MGMT methylation in the lungs of smokers, and support the importance of UBR1 in regulating methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase homeostasis and DNA repair of alkylated DNA adducts in cells.
PMC4526392	D00003	Thus, SNPs affecting the predisposition of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase silencing by promoter hypermethylation, together with SNPs affecting methylation of other important cancer-relevant genes acquired during carcinogenesis may lead to the establishment of a polygenic marker that could improve current risk prediction models for these cancers (18).
PMC4526392	D01002	The assessment of MGMT promoter activity using HEBC4 identified a 50% reduction in luciferase reporter activity for the combination of UBR1 KD and HAP4 (rs16906252 carrier) compared to wild type UBR1 and HAP1 (non rs16906252 carrier).
PMC4526392	D01004	Furthermore, these two SNPs should also augment MGMT methylation status for the better stratification of patients for alkylating therapy due to their association with reduced MGMT transcription in methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase unmethylated cells.
PMC4526392	D02002	Ontology classification of genes (n=115) in the region of the proximal CpG sites mediating the trans-acting associations identified GTPase activity related genes, genes regulating transcription, and genetic imprinting as the top three categories involved in DNA methylation regulation.
PMC4526392	D02010	Thus, our findings not only substantiate the reduced gene transcription as a major determinant for MGMT methylation in the lungs of smokers, but also support the importance of UBR1 mediated N-end rule pathway in regulating methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase homeostasis and DNA repair towards alkylated DNA adducts.

PMC4526392	I00002	The irreversible binding of the alkyl group to the MGMT protein functionally inactivates the enzyme and leads to a structural alteration resulting in the recognition by ubiquitin ligases and degradation by the proteasome (1,2).
PMC4526392	I00003	The recovery of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity after its inactivation with alkylating agents is slow and results entirely from de novo protein synthesis (3–5).
PMC4526392	I01005	In addition, methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation is also a prognostic biomarker for response of glioblastoma patients to the alkylating agent temozolomide (13,14).
PMC4526392	I03006	To address this issue, a GWAS discovery and replication study was conducted in two smoker cohorts from New Mexico to identify novel loci whose association with risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation detected in sputum was independent of the enhancer SNP.
PMC4526392	M01004	Methylation status for CpGs around the transcriptional start site of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase was assessed using two stage methylation specific PCR (33).
PMC4526392	M03000	Four SNPs (rs72887860, rs62287262, rs16957091, and rs997781) associated with risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation in LSC (p<10−5 in models with adjustment for rs16906252) and with MAF >0.1 were selected for replication using the VSC (n=430, Supplementary Table 2).
PMC4526392	M07000	A 1,528-bp fragment containing the entire promoter and CpG island of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase with different haplotype alleles was previously cloned into the pGL2-basic Luciferase Reporter Vector (Promega, Madison, WI) upstream of the luciferase coding sequence (27).

PMC4526392	M09001	Protein extract (90 μg) was digested with 100 ng endoproteinase GluC in a 25 μl reaction mixture before being resolved in PAGE gels (36).
PMC4526392	M09002	Naïve and suicide methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase protein levels were quantified by densitometry (Image Lab, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) of the individual bands.
PMC4526392	M12001	The genotype of rs16906252 was further included for covariate adjustment in models that would identify novel SNPs whose association with risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation was independent of rs16906252.
PMC4526392	M13002	However, the inclusion of both ethnicities should not affect our results because the prevalence of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation and the distribution of the four SNPs are not different between the two major ethnicities in the VSC.
PMC4526392	M14002	The paired t-test was used to compare the difference of the ratio of naïve versus suicide methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase and O6MG between UBR1 KD and control cell lines.
PMC4526392	R00005	SNPs located around the methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter became non-significant (ps>0.94, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 2), suggesting the associations seen for these SNPs reflected some degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs16906252.
PMC4526392	R01000	Four SNPs (rs72887860, rs62287262, rs16957091, and rs997781) associated with risk for MGMT methylation in LSC with p<10−5 and MAF >0.1 were selected for replication in 430 members from the Veteran Smokers cohort (VSC) with methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation detected in 107 subjects (24.9%).
PMC4526392	R02003	Association analyses based on imputation results on chromosome 15 identified five SNPs associated with risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation with p-values slightly lower than that seen for rs16957091, although all five SNPs are in almost perfect LD with rs16957091 (R2s≥0.95) (Figure 2).
PMC4526392	R05003	Thus, the lower expression of UBR1 associated with rs16957091 variant allele could result in slower turnover of the MGMT protein under normal physiological conditions and/or following repair in response to challenge by the alkylating agents, that in turn may lead to reduced methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase transcription.
PMC4526392	R06001	A protease V8 digestion method (36) was used to distinguish naïve and suicide MGMT in HBEC1 treated with different MNU concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5 mM) for 30 min.
PMC4526392	R06003	Interestingly, without MNU treatment, protease V8 cutting is still detected supporting formation of endogenous alkylating DNA adducts as a part of normal cellular metabolism in these cells (1,42), although the assay specificity for detecting suicide MGMT may not be perfect due to its potential binding to other proteins.
PMC4526392	R06011	In addition to the UBR1/RAD6-dependent N-end rule pathway, UFD4/UBC4-dependent ubiquitin fusion degradation pathway functions as an enhancer of the processivity of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase polyubiquitylation by N-end rule pathway through physical interaction between the HECT-type UFD4 E3 and the RING-type UBR1 E3 (40,41).
PMC4526392	R08000	Reduced gene transcription is a major mechanism predisposing MGMT for promoter hypermethylation in multiple tissue types (13,27), therefore a luciferase reporter assay was used to assess whether UBR1 KD would result in reduced MGMT promoter activity.
PMC4526392	R08006	These findings suggest that impaired MGMT turnover due to UBR1 KD may lead to reduced MGMT transcription, an important factor in the predisposition for promoter hypermethylation of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase.
PMC4526392	R09006	However, statistically significant differences were identified for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase induction between control and UBR1 KD in HBEC4 (least square means and standard error, 1.68 ± 0.068 vs. 1.17 ± 0.068, p=0.0057) and HBEC26 (least square means and standard error, 1.43 ± 0.067 vs. 1.13 ± 0.067, p=0.032) in the GLM with adjustment for assay batch and time point (24 vs. 48 hr).

PMC4641004	D02003	It is known that microtubules are involved in various signaling pathways, such as sonic hedgehog/Gli, Wnt/β-catenin, G-protein, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways which are related to skeletal development and homeostasis.25,26 Interestingly, recent reports noted that inhibition of microtubule assembly increases osteoblast differentiation in vitro, and murine bone mass in vivo.27,28 Formation of new microtubule polymers from heterodimers of α and β tubulin is termed ‘nucleation’ and requires another member of the tubulin family, γ tubulin.29 γ tubulin forms γ tubulin ring complexes with additional proteins and these γ tubulin complexes may also be involved in regulating microtubule dynamics.30 Tubulin folding cofactor D coded by TBCD is one of the five tubulin-specific cochaperones A-E that mediate the nucleation of tubulin.31 Tubulin folding cofactor D plays a critical role in recruiting γ tubulin ring complexes and initiating microtubule growth and excess of tubulin folding cofactor D inhibits microtubule assembly.12 Taken together, it is possible that a disruption in the γ tubulin pathway in the osteoblast cells may result in BMD changes and these changes may be modified via genetic factors.

PMC4962704	I02001	Here we report the largest study to date to determine the clinical and genetic risk factors for acute pancreatitis in 5,398 patients treated for newly diagnosed ALL with contemporary regimens containing asparaginase.
PMC4962704	M01002	From approximately 5,500 patients enrolled in AALL0331, there were 103 cases of pancreatitis; of these, we included all 71 cases who had available germline DNA and successful genotyping and matched two controls to each case by age (± 2 years) and protocol-planned asparaginase doses.
PMC4962704	M02001	The criteria were similar across all studies, including symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting), increased serum amylase or lipase, and radiographic or surgical findings.
PMC4962704	M02006	For purposes of normalizing asparaginase doses across protocols, pegylated Escherichia coli–asparaginase (PEG-asparaginase) at 2,500 U/m2 every other week was considered equivalent to native Escherichia coli–asparaginase at 25,000 U/m2 once per week for 2 weeks.
PMC4962704	R00003	The great majority of the events were clustered with asparaginase administration (Data Supplement Figure 1).
PMC4962704	R01001	Because asparaginase dose and duration were correlated (R2, 0.64; P = .0011; Data Supplement Figure 2), it was not possible to determine which was more important for pancreatitis risk.
PMC4962704	R02004	To minimize the effect of dose as a confounder for evaluating formulation, we looked at P9904/P9905, the only study that included patients treated with one or the other formulation (Data Supplement Table 3), and the crude percentage with pancreatitis did not differ between those who received native asparaginase alone (0.8%, six of 723), PEG-asparaginase alone (0.9%, three of 347), or both (0.6%, three of 535).
PMC4962704	R03004	Two of 3,469 patients carried this variant (one in the cohort and one in the case-control group), and both developed early pancreatitis (Fig 3B); one of them had recurrent episodes after each of two asparaginase re-exposures.

PMC5309133	A00005	In a GWAS, TPMT activity in patients behaves as a monogenic trait, further bolstering the utility of thiopurine S- methyltransferase genetic testing in the clinic.
PMC5309133	D00003	Also, not all thiopurine S- methyltransferase wild-type patients tolerated full dose of mercaptopurine; the average dose intensity for wild-types ranged between 80–85%.(21, 25)
PMC5309133	D01002	This is most likely because they are in LD with no-function variants in thiopurine S- methyltransferase (Figure S1).
PMC5309133	D02004	Herein, we observed one Hispanic patient (MAF = 0.2% in Hispanics) who carried TPMT*X, and this patient had intermediate thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity of 12.8 U/mL. Of 11,566 Latino subjects in the ExAC dataset, three individuals were heterozygous for this variant, yielding an MAF of 0.03%.
PMC5309133	D03005	Thus, genotyping of the three no-function SNPs (rs1800462, rs1800460 and rs1142345) is still the most reliable method to determine TPMT phenotype, and rare variants maymay be less of a problem for thiopurine S- methyltransferase than for other actionable pharmacogenes.
PMC5309133	D04002	There could be trans-SNPs with weaker effect sizes or lower MAF that could influence thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity, but a larger sample size would be needed to discover those SNPs.
PMC5309133	D05003	In any case, the effect of additional genetic factors on TPMT activity was not comparable to the effect of thiopurine S- methyltransferase genotype.
PMC5309133	D06002	However, in this study the FTO variants only accounted for a minor change in TPMT activity: among the 896 patients wild-type for thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype, those with two vs one vs zero C alleles at rs1345390 had a median activity of 19.5, 19.0, and 18.2 U/mL vs (P = 7.3 × 10−6 after adjusting for clinical features).
PMC5309133	D07008	In the current study, rs2413739 was not associated with TPMT activity in patients (P = 0.14 and 0.54 in SJ and COG, respectively, after adjusting for TPMT clinical genotype).We compared our results with another study that used a pathway approach;(38) among the top ranked SNPs from that study, only the 2 SNPs in thiopurine S- methyltransferase were replicated in our study of HapMap LCLs and in SJ and COG patients (Table S9).
PMC5309133	D08004	Given that black patients tend to have a high risk of relapse(40–42) and that thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity might be associated with relapse risk,(23, 43, 44) genetic and non-genetic factors should be considered in dose individualization in those patients.
PMC5309133	D09002	Here we observed that older age was associated with lower TPMT activity after adjusting for thiopurine S- methyltransferase genotype in both cohorts (Table 1).
PMC5309133	D10000	In summary, we used a genome-wide agnosticagnostic approach to confirm that TPMT activity was a monogenic trait, and that current strategies for clinical TPMT genetic testing based on only three genomic variants adequately classify patients for their TPMT phenotype in a multiethnic cohort, thereby bolstering the use of TPMT genetic testing to assess thiopurine S- methyltransferase status in the clinic.

PMC5309133	I00000	Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) genomic variation has been associated with toxicities from mercaptopurine, a critical component in the treatment of autoimmune diseases, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphomas.(1, 2) Dosage individualization based on TPMT genotype or erythrocyte enzymatic activity (phenotype) is recommended for patients receiving thiopurines.(3) Without individualizing thiopurine doses based on TPMT, toxicity due to thiopurine S- methyltransferase defects resulted in treatment interruptions,(2, 4) which have been associated with worse outcomes.(5–7)
PMC5309133	I01005	Here we studied two ethnically diverse cohorts of children with ALL using agnostic GWAS approaches to evaluate the contribution of genetic variation in TPMT and other genes to TPMT activity and effects on thiopurine tolerance, and to determine whether current TPMT genetic testing adequately classifies patients for their thiopurine S- methyltransferase phenotype.
PMC5309133	M01001	Considering the impact of anemia and blood transfusion on thiopurine S- methyltransferase enzymatic activity, (50, 51) blood samples were collected after remission induction and ≥ 90 days after erythrocyte transfusions.

PMC5309133	M03004	We also identified additional variants by sequencing the thiopurine S- methyltransferase gene in SJ patients (n = 296; Table S3), as described.(53)
PMC5309133	M04002	After excluding SNPs with a call rate < 95%, over 9 million SNPs (including 578233 typed SNPs) were interrogated in the initial GWAS for thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in the SJ and COG cohorts separately.
PMC5309133	M05000	To determine non-TPMT genetic covariates for TPMT activity, we conducted a second GWAS that included the covariates of ancestry and age as continuous variables, and thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype coded as 0 (wild-type), 1 (heterozygous) or 2 (homozygous) for the number of *2, *3A, or *3C alleles.
PMC5309133	M06002	A GWAS for thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity was performed using genetic ancestry as a continuous variable.
PMC5309133	M08001	The classification performance of thiopurine S- methyltransferase genotypes was evaluated in terms of receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) curves (Figures S5 and S6).
PMC5309133	R00005	African ancestry (meta-P = 1.4 × 10−7) and older age (meta-P = 6.6 × 10−4) were also associated with lower TPMT activity in both SJ and COG cohorts after adjusting for thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype.
PMC5309133	R01009	Patients who carried a *8 allele tended to have TPMT activity (median 14.7 U/mL, range 12.1–21.1 U/mL; Figure 2) that was lower than those with thiopurine S- methyltransferase *1/*1 (median 18.6 U/mL, range 7.1–33.1 U/mL; P = 0.15) but higher than those with heterozygote clinical genotype including *2, *3A or *3C (P = 3.9 × 10−8).
PMC5309133	R02007	The 92 SNPs that reached genome-wide significance (the 94 SNPs in Table S2, excluding the clinical SNPs of rs1142345 and rs1800460) accounted for another 0.9% in thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity variability beyond that explained by the clinically tested alleles of *2, *3A and *3C.
PMC5309133	R03006	Assuming these rare damaging TPMT variants have similar effect sizes as do TPMT *2/*3A/*3C, we estimate that 1.2% (95% CI: 0.78%–1.65%) of variation in TPMT activity could possibly be explained by additional rare thiopurine S- methyltransferase variants, indicating a likely minimal contribution of other SNPs in the locus.
PMC5309133	R04009	In the meta-analysis of non-TPMT SNPs, no SNP reached genome-wide significance (Table S7 and Figure S2C); rs1345390 in FTO was the top-ranked genotyped SNP associated with increased thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in SJ (P = 4.5 × 10−3) and COG patients (P = 7.9 × 10−5), and in the meta-analysis (P = 1.6 × 10−6).
PMC5309133	R05005	Among the 94 SNPs that were genome-wide significant in patients (Table S2), 10 were also genotyped in LCLs, and 5 were associated with thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity at the P < 0.05 level.
PMC5309133	R06002	The top ranked SNPs associated with thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in the permutation tests were similar to those from the patient GWAS in the two separate cohorts (data not shown).
PMC5309133	R07005	Adding other TPMT variants such as the *8 and *24 alleles, or the three genome-wide significant SNPs (rs11964408, rs6908777 and rs16880220) did not improve the classification performance of clinical thiopurine S- methyltransferase genotype to assess phenotype (Figure S6).

PMC5395320	A00000	Thiopurine-related hematotoxicity in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and inflammatory bowel diseases has been linked to genetically defined variability in thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) activity.
PMC5395320	A00005	This finding is consistent with TPMT genotype being the primary determinant of TPMT activity, reinforcing the rationale for genetic testing of thiopurine S-methyltransferase alleles in routine clinical practice to individualize MP dosage.
PMC5395320	D00000	Based on several clinical studies and various disease entities (e.g. ALL in childhood, IBD, autoimmune diseases)19,20 pretreatment determination of the TPMT phenotype and subsequent pharmacogenetically-guided dosing of thiopurines, at least in TPMT deficient individuals, is recommended in routine clinical practice before commencing therapy.5 Very recently a landmark randomized clinical trial strongly corroborates the clinical utility of upfront genetic testing for TPMT in patients treated with thiopurines to avoid hematotoxicity.9 IBD patients who were identified as variant carriers of thiopurine S-methyltransferase and subsequently received dose adjusted thiopurine therapy, showed a 10-fold reduction in hematologic side effects.
PMC5395320	D01002	Of note, in the retrospective study by Colombel et al.21 only 29.3% of 41 patients with IBD and azathioprine-related severe myelosuppression were carriers of thiopurine S-methyltransferase variant alleles.
PMC5395320	D02001	For example, S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), the global methyl donor in the human body, has been discovered as a modulator of TPMT activity.11 One previous study using HapMap CEU cell lines and two pediatric ALL-patient cohorts indicate that independent from TPMT a second gene, PACSIN2, which is a member of the ‘protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons’ family of proteins, also modulates TPMT activity and is associated with the MP-related gastrointestinal toxicity in children with ALL.14 Additionally, a GWAS was performed and identified genes in the thiopurine pathway that were associated with thiopurine metabolism in lymphoblastoid cell lines from individuals of different ethnic background and clinical response in pediatric ALL patients.13 Altogether, conclusive information is still missing which demonstrates that TPMT genetics is the ideal predictor for thiopurine S-methyltransferase phenotype and replication of novel identified non-TPMT candidate variants have not been performed in independent large-scale studies.
PMC5395320	D03000	The present data from our meta-analysis of three independent GWAS clearly indicate that TPMT genetics seems to have the strongest impact on TPMT activity in humans and provide little support for the proposal that other genes may significantly contribute to interindividual variability of thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity.
PMC5395320	D04004	Of note, we observed a TPMT genotype-phenotype discordance in ALL patients compared with the Estonia cohort attributed to the disease process of ALL and anemia of patients resulting in lower TPMT activities in RBCs due to degraded thiopurine S-methyltransferase enzyme.23,24
PMC5395320	D05005	Further analyses conditioning on the TPMT*3A and *3C alleles were performed, revealing no significantly associated variants (P<5.0×10−8) with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in all three cohorts.
PMC5395320	D06002	However, our findings provide little support for any effect mediated through TPMT, as there was only negligible correlation related to thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in our cohorts (Table 1).
PMC5395320	D07000	Moreover, SNPs localizing to PACSIN2, previously found to influence TPMT activity and be related to MP-related gastrointestinal toxicity,14 were not associated with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in our analyses.
PMC5395320	D08001	No potential interaction of the NUDT15 R139C variant (rs116855232) with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity was found in all of our three cohorts (Table 1) keeping in mind that the allele frequency is extremely low in non-Asians.
PMC5395320	D09002	Noticeably, no significantly associated variants in SLC22A16 (P<5.0×10−8) with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity were found.
PMC5395320	D10004	It remains questionable if the correlation of mRNA derived from white blood cells and thiopurine S-methyltransferase enzyme activity measured in RBC is reasonable.
PMC5395320	D11005	Thus, we can not exclude that in addition to thiopurine S-methyltransferase further genes are involved in risk of toxicity or treatment outcome.
PMC5395320	D12000	In conclusion, based on the largest meta-GWAS including 1212 subjects from different populations, we did not identify any novel associations for TPMT activity, thereby endorsing genetic testing for thiopurine S-methyltransferase alleles as advocated by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium5 and the Dutch pharmacogenetics group10 for prediction of patient`s phenotype prior to thiopurine therapy in patients with ALL.

PMC5395320	I00004	Furthermore, intermediate TPMT activity, only partly explained by TPMT heterozygosity present in 10% of individuals,8 is also associated with an increased risk of toxicity.5,6 Recently, a prospective clinical trial confirmed a lower incidence of leucopenia in pre-treatment thiopurine S-methyltransferase heterozygous-tested patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after dose-adjusted thiopurine therapy.9
PMC5395320	I01001	Moreover, systematic data regarding the correlation between TPMT genotype and thiopurine S-methyltransferase expression or function in human liver, as the predominant site of thiopurine metabolism, is still missing.
PMC5395320	I02000	To address this deficiency we have conducted the so far largest meta-analysis of three independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity comprising 844 individuals of the Estonian population cohort and 245 pediatric ALL cases, as well as 123 human livers.
PMC5395320	M00002	One inclusion criterion for the TPMT study was that there is no regular use of medications associated with thiopurine S-methyltransferase.
PMC5395320	M02006	Cytosol used for thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity measurements was available for liver samples of 124 patients (n=124; 54 males, 70 females; age: median 58 years, range 7 to 85 years).
PMC5395320	M03001	The cut-off for TPMT deficiency based on TPMT activity measurements in liver cytosol was suggested to be 0 nmol h−1 mg−1, and the cut-off for thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in RBCs is ≤2 nmol 6-MTG ×
PMC5395320	M06000	In addition, the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene region was analyzed systematically in human liver samples for presence of genetic variations by next-generation sequencing (NGS).
PMC5395320	M07001	thiopurine S-methyltransferase expression was normalized against β-actin expression, which was measured with the HUMAN ACTB (beta actin)
PMC5395320	M08001	thiopurine S-methyltransferase protein levels, quantified through immunoblotting, were available for 122 samples.
PMC5395320	M09005	Subsequently, we additionally conditioned on additive dosages of the respective thiopurine S-methyltransferase variants (TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C) to test for secondary signals.
PMC5395320	M10000	Results of all three GWAS datasets were combined into a joint meta-analysis using GWAMA software.42 Results for the Estonian study and the ALL study, where the thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity was measured in blood were combined in an inverse of variance weighted fixed effect meta-analysis and the results for the IKP liver cohort with activity measurements in liver cytosol were added in a two degrees of freedom test allowing for the differential effect sizes between the two sample types (blood and liver).43
PMC5395320	M11002	Regional association plots showing −log10P values of genetic variants relative to the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene region were generated using LocusZoom.44 Here, LD (r2) was calculated from the European population in 1000 Genomes (hg19, Nov 2014).
PMC5395320	M12001	R-package beanplot_1.245 was applied to display the association between TPMT activity and common thiopurine S-methyltransferase SNPs, with thick black lines representing the medians per group and the dotted line the overall median.
PMC5395320	R00001	TPMT activity measured in RBC of 844 individuals (414 males, 430 females; age range 18–87 years) of the Estonian cohort showed a bimodal distribution and none of the cohort were shown to be thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficient (Figure 1A).
PMC5395320	R01008	Moreover, previously identified candidate SNPs were only negligibly related to thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in the Estonian cohort based on our GWAS data (Table 1).
PMC5395320	R02012	In line with these observations, previously identified candidate SNPs were not associated with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in the ALL cohort based on our GWAS data (Table 1).
PMC5395320	R03004	As shown in the Manhattan plot and also in the regional association plot displayed in Figure 3B–3C, only genetic variants within the TPMT region were significantly associated with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity (P<5.0×10−8) (Table S3).
PMC5395320	R04001	Moreover, by genotyping 22 functionally relevant TPMT alleles using an established and validated MALDI-TOF MS method,18 as well as next generation sequencing (NGS) of the TPMT coding region, the presence of other functionally relevant thiopurine S-methyltransferase variant alleles could be ruled out.
PMC5395320	R05002	In addition, previously identified candidate SNPs were not associated with hepatic thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity based on our GWAS data (Table 1).
PMC5395320	R06002	In contrast, TPMT mRNA expression was not significantly correlated with either TPMT activity or TPMT protein level (Figure4B and 4C) in human liver, even after exclusion of thiopurine S-methyltransferase variant cases.
PMC5395320	R07003	The remaining 11%, which were also located on chromosome 6 (but outside the TPMT region), were only significantly associated with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in the Estonian cohort (Figure 5A).
PMC5395320	R08002	As shown in the regional association plot, the sentinel marker is tightly linked to the thiopurine S-methyltransferase variant 719A>G (rs1142345) (Figure 5B).

PMC5585859	I14000	Interestingly, the gene identified in our rare and common variant analyses, SH3PXD2A, is expressed in human atria and ventricles and encodes TKS5, a tyrosine kinase substrate.
PMC5585859	I14002	TKS5 has been shown to be important in determining the invasiveness of cancer cells13 and has been suggested to mediate the neurotoxic effect of beta-amyloid in Alzheimer disease in association with the matrix metalloproteinase gene ADAM12.14 Developmentally, SH3PXD2A is important for neural crest migration; homozygous knockout in mice result in complete cleft in the secondary palate and neonatal death;15 however, the relation between SH3PXD2A and atrial fibrillation is unclear and as with any rare variant association, replication in a large, independent dataset will ultimately be required.
PMC5600471	A00001	Two major reactions contribute to E1 plasma concentrations, aromatase (CYP19A1) catalyzed E1 synthesis from androstenedione and steroid sulfatase (STS) catalyzed hydrolysis of estrone conjugates (E1Cs).
PMC5600471	A00002	E1Cs have been associated with breast cancer risk and may contribute to tumor progression since sulfatase is expressed in breast cancer where its activity exceeds that of aromatase.
PMC5600471	A01001	Hormone concentrations were measured prior to aromatase inhibitor therapy.
PMC5600471	A03000	These results suggest a mechanism for genetic variation in E1C plasma concentrations as well as possible SNP biomarkers to identify ER+ breast cancer patients for whom sulfatase inhibitors might be of clinical value.
PMC5600471	D03013	[51] demonstrated that patients with high steroid sulfatase [STS] expression in breast tumors had a higher risk of recurrence than those with low expression.
PMC5600471	D03018	Thus, patients who are homozygous variant for rs4149056 and are on an aromatase inhibitor could be selected for clinical trials of sulfatase inhibitor as add-on therapy.
PMC5600471	D04002	This pathway remains active in patients who are on aromatase inhibitor therapy.
PMC5600471	D04004	These variants may provide a means by which to identify ER+ breast cancer patients on AI therapy who are at increased risk for tumor recurrence because of elevated tumor E1C exposure, and who might benefit from additional therapy such as sulfatase inhibition.

PMC5600471	I00005	However, since E1 can be converted to E2 by 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, the estrogenic effects observed for E1 may be driven by E2 as it has a much higher affinity for ER [5].
PMC5600471	I00007	In post-menopausal women, androstenedione is converted to E1 by aromatase (CYP19A1) in adipose tissue, the adrenal glands, liver, and in breast tumors.
PMC5600471	I00010	E1S is biologically inactive, but is a “reservoir” for active estrogen since it can be hydrolyzed to E1 by steroid sulfatase (sulfatase)
PMC5600471	I01003	Aromatase inhibitors (AI), the major endocrine therapy for ER+ tumors in the adjuvant setting [21], target only one source of estrogens, i.e., their synthesis from androgens.
PMC5600471	I01005	Therefore, drugs that target this source of estrogens, i.e., sulfatase inhibitors [22–25], have been developed as an additional approach to the treatment of ER+ breast cancer.
PMC5600471	R06002	CYP19A1 was of interest since it encodes aromatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androstenedione to E1 and of testosterone to E2.
PMC5605835	M08002	Pull-down assays, miRNA and anti-miRNA transfection, Western blot analysis, ELISAs, and luciferase assays were used to assess miRNA binding and validate BAFF mRNA–miRNA interactions.

PMC5605835	R14002	However, the higher luciferase activity from short reporters than from long reporters — either basal or cotransfected with miR-15a after mutating miR-15a binding sites — suggests that miR-15a does not fully explain the BAFF-var regulatory effects, and other miRNAs or RNA-binding proteins may also influence soluble BAFF levels.

PMC5671896	D04002	Variant rs236352 lies within a predicted cardiac super-enhancer.33, 34 The putative super-enhancer overlaps a DNaseI hypersensitive site in cardiac tissues, ChIP-Seq peaks of RNA polymerase II, subunits of cohesion complexes (e.g., SMC3), and chromatin regulators (e.g., EP300), which are known to associate with super-enhancers.33, 35 Plausible right atrial gene targets of the super-enhancer that contains rs236352 are its eQTL targets, CPNE5, which encodes a Ca++-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein, and PPIL1.
PMC5690841	D02006	As opposed to the independent effects of LPIN1, in 2012, Santoro et al. reported that the rs1260326 variant in the glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR) was associated with fat accumulation (detected by proton nuclear magnetic resonance, not histology) in the liver together with PNPLA3 to increase susceptibility in obese youths (41).

PMC5703348	R10010	Overexpression of either miR-145 or miR-181 significantly reduced the luciferase activity in cells transfected with pLS-FXI-3’UTR, but not the control pLS vector, suggesting that miR-145 (and miR-181) indeed targets F11 mRNA through its 3’-UTR (Fig. 2) and regulate FXI levels.

PMC5728318	A00000	The metalloprotease ADAMTS13 cleaves von Willebrand factor (VWF) in circulating blood, limiting the size of VWF multimers and regulating VWF activity.
PMC5728318	I00003	The homeostatic distribution of VWF multimer size is modulated by ADAMTS13, a metalloprotease that cleaves circulating VWF into smaller concatamers.3 Previous studies have reported loss of higher-molecular-weight multimers in the bleeding disorder von Willebrand disease type 2A, and conversely, an accumulation of ultralarge VWF monomers4 in thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura,5 demonstrating the importance of the regulation of VWF activity by ADAMTS13.
PMC5728318	I00005	Unlike many proteases, ADAMTS13 is secreted in an active form and, to date, no specific inhibitor of ADAMTS13 has been identified.
PMC5728318	R08002	We generated stable HEK293 Flp-In T-REx cell lines expressing these 3 forms of ADAMTS13 and measured the concentration of ADAMTS13 (μg/μL) in conditioned media and cell lysates, adjusting concentrations for the estimated number of cells per well with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (μg/μL) levels from cell lysates.

PMC5789458	D05008	It is also noteworthy that the present study identified genome-wide significant evidence implicating three phosphodiesterase genes: PDE1C, PDE2A, and PDE4D. In particular, there is growing interest in PDE2A inhibitors as potential agents for cognitive enhancement (Trabanco et al. 2016), and evidence suggests that these agents may enhance synaptic plasticity via presynaptic modulation of cAMP hydrolysis (Fernández-Fernández et al. 2015).

GWAS using a genomic data-enriched LCL model system, together with functional and mechanistic studies using cancer cell lines, help us to identify novel genetic and epigenetic biomarkers involved in metformin anticancer response.
PMC6078562	D03002	STUB1 is known as a U-Box E3 ubiquitin ligase.
PMC6078562	D03007	In this study, we showed that STUB1 interacted with cyclin A and provided evidence that STUB1 influenced metformin response through its function as an E3 ligase for cyclin A.

PMC2717907	D02002	Given the enhanced expression of pyruvate carboxylase, this is best explained with the activation of pyruvate carboxylation, i.e. carboxylation of [U-13C]-pyruvate to generate [13C3]-oxaloacetate, which is transaminated to produce [13C3]-Asp (Fig. ​(Fig.6B).6B).

PMC2755199	I00003	The mechanistic explanation has been attributed to its role as an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (nitric oxide synthase), reducing the production of NO thereby diminishing vascular reactivity and leading to endothelial dysfunction and vasculopathy8.
PMC2755199	I01004	In contrast, methylation of other amino acids such as the production of methyl-lysine occurs via alternative methyltransferases and has no known relationship with arginine-NO metabolic pathways.
PMC2755199	I01005	The methyltransferases responsible for arginine methylation, the proteases involved in liberation of the free methylargnine derivatives and the catabolic dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases involved in metabolism of ADMA are all apparently influenced by conditions associated with inflammation and oxidative stress11, raising the possibility that some of the observed associations between ADMA levels and cardiovascular disease may occur in part via mechanisms independent of endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibition.

PMC2836072	D02002	Its immediate precursors in the acidic pathway, 3β-hydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic acid and 3β,7α-dihydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic acid, were each shown to activate the LXRα in a luciferase assay (Scheme 4 and Fig. 5), whereas 7α-hydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic acid was inactive.
PMC2836072	I01004	It should be noted that sulfated and glucuronidase oxysterols have also been found in plasma (15, 16) and that there is the possibility that sulfated sterols also have biological activity (17).

PMC2836072	R04018	Of the other oxysterols, 25-hydroxycholesterol can be formed enzymatically by a cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (51) and also by CYP46A1 (48), but it is also an autoxidation product of cholesterol, as are 7β-hydroxycholesterol and 7-oxocholesterol (46), whereas 6-hydroxycholesterol is a decomposition product of the autoxidation products 5,6-epoxycholesterol (5,6-epoxycholestan-3β-ol, C-3β-ol-5,6-epoxide) and cholestane-3β,5α,6β-triol (C-3β,5α,6β-triol) (33).
PMC2836072	R05003	It was possible to differentiate endogenous 7α-hydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic acid from that generated by treatment with bacterial cholesterol oxidase, as the abundance of the GP-tagged compound did not change when derivatization was performed in the presence or absence of the bacterial cholesterol oxidase.
PMC2836072	R05004	Similarly, GP-tagged 3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic acid (CA4-3-one) was only identified following treatment with bacterial cholesterol oxidase and thus must originate from endogenous 3β-hydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic acid.

PMC3319463	I01000	MEL’s use in sleep regulation is particularly important in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).5–9 About two-thirds of patients with ASD suffer from sleep disturbance with the most common clinical subtype being insomnia.5 In a recent meta-analysis of MEL treatment in ASD, 12 out of 18 studies reported an overall improvement rate of 84.2% (95% CI 81.4–88.9%) in sleep for the 349 participants, where improvement was qualified by fewer night wakings, earlier sleep onset and greater sleep duration.5 Generally, lower levels of MEL are observed in patients with ASD versus controls, but the reason is unclear.6–9 One report showed an association of a low urinary melatonin metabolite (6-sulfatoxymelatonin) and deeper levels of non-rapid eye movement sleep.10 Reduced production of MEL has been attributed to a range of factors including alterations in serotonergic or acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase activity.7, 11, 12
PMC3319463	R12007	Melke and coworkers investigated the effects of acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase) mutations on the enzymatic synthesis of MEL from its precursor NAS, but was unable to make a direct correlation to ASD onset.7 These results and the novel capability of this method to measure endogenous levels of MEL and its precursor NAS introduce the potential to begin mapping out the dynamics of the MEL production pathway in children with ASD.

PMC3325153	A00000	Paraoxon (diethyl 4-nitrophenyl phosphate) is an active metabolite of the common insecticide parathion and is acutely toxic due to the inhibition of cholinesterase (cholinesterase) activity in the nervous systems.
PMC3325153	A00001	The inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity by paraoxon is due to the formation of phosphorylated BChE adduct, and the detection of the phosphorylated BChE adduct in human plasma can serve as an exposure biomarker of organophosphate pesticides and nerve agents.
PMC3325153	A00007	Thus, immunoaffinity purification combined with LC-MS represents a viable approach for the detection and quantification of phosphorylated butyrylcholinesterase as an exposure biomarker of organophosphates and nerve agents.
PMC3325153	I00001	OPs are highly toxic because they rapidly inactivate the cholinesterase (cholinesterase) activity via the phosphorylation of the serine hydroxyl group located in the catalytic triad of the active center by OP agents [2, 3].
PMC3325153	I00002	Acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE, EC 3.1.1.8) are serine hydrolases in which the active center contains a serine residue [4, 5].
PMC3325153	I00004	BChE, also called pseudocholinesterase, catalyzes the hydrolysis of a variety of choline and noncholine esters in the same way as AChE
PMC3325153	I00007	Higher reactivity with OP compounds and relatively longer residence time (11-day half life in plasma [8]) makes butyrylcholinesterase an ideal biomarker for monitoring OP poisoning
PMC3325153	I01000	Over the years, different biomarkers have been used as indicators of OP poisoning such as OP metabolites in blood and urine, decreased cholinesterase activity in serum, free unbound OPs in blood, and OP-ChE adducts, and different analytical methods have been developed to identify them
PMC3325153	I01006	Alternatively, direct detection of phosphorylated peptide from butyrylcholinesterase at the catalytic site after proteolysis represents a promising means for assessing OP poisoning because the protein adduct has long-term presence in blood.
PMC3325153	I02003	To overcome this limitation, an immunoaffinity purification method has recently been developed [10, 20] to facilitate the MS detection of the modified butyrylcholinesterase.
PMC3325153	I03001	Paraoxon, a bioactive metabolite of the OP insecticide parathion [21], is used as a model compound for generating phosphorylated butyrylcholinesterase adducts.
PMC3325153	I03002	Paraoxon is known as a cholinesterase inhibitor [22] and has been commonly used as a model compound to study OP poisoning because of less toxicity (in rats, 50% lethal dose is 1.8 mg/kg compared to 0.001 mg/kg for O-ethyl S-[2–(diisopropylamino)ethyl] methylphosphonothioate; VX), and less volatility than many other OP compounds [23, 24].
PMC3325153	I04005	The accurate mass and retention time information allowed the detection of phosphorylated butyrylcholinesterase peptide in human plasma by accurate mass measurements using high resolution MS instead of relying on MS/MS due to the potential under-sampling issue of low-abundance peptides in complex samples.
PMC3325153	M00004	Human butyrylcholinesterase, rabbit IgG antibody, dithiothreitol, iodoacetamide, urea, formic acid, ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) were all purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).
PMC3325153	M03000	To obtain a model OP-BChE, 100 µl (~100 µg) of commercial butyrylcholinesterase in water was mixed with 5 µl of 75 mM paraoxon in acetone (the final acetone concentration in the mixture is less than 5% to avoid protein precipitation).
PMC3325153	M05002	Following separation from reaction solution, magnetic beads were washed with 100 µl of PBS for three times and treated with 50 µl of the elution buffer (70% acetonitrile containing 0.5% acetic acid) for 2 min to release the captured butyrylcholinesterase from the complex.
PMC3325153	M06002	The bound butyrylcholinesterase was released with 40 µl of elution buffer, and the process was repeated one more time.
PMC3325153	M07000	Extracted butyrylcholinesterase samples were lyophilized and re-suspended in the SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 1% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromophenol blue), and subjected to 1D SDS-PAGE analysis in a 4–12% pre-cast gradient gel (Invitrogen) and electrophoresed at 200 volts for 35 min with MES-SDS running buffer (Invitrogen).
PMC3325153	M07003	After washing with the washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween, pH 8.0), the membranes were further incubated with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies.
PMC3325153	M08001	40 µl aliquots containing about 10 µg of purified butyrylcholinesterase were lyophylized and reconstituted in 40 µl of 50 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8).
PMC3325153	R00003	Briefly, BChE is captured by streptavidin magnetic beads conjugated with biotin-anti-BChE antibodies, which bind to both the native and modified butyrylcholinesterase.
PMC3325153	R01004	Based on the absorption intensities and extinction coefficients, the mole ratio of biotin and butyrylcholinesterase antibody was calculated as 6.
PMC3325153	R02002	2A. Profiles on the unmodified BChE without purification (lane 1a), the supernatant after capturing BChE (lane 1b) and the eluted BChE after capture (lane 1c), and the corresponding panels 1a’, 1b’ and 1c’ for the modified BChE, respectively, clearly demonstrated the ability of magnetic beads to effectively capture both the unmodified and OP-modified BChE and a high recovery of captured butyrylcholinesterase following elution.
PMC3325153	R03005	The overall results suggest that the current strategy is applicable to effectively purify both the unmodified as well as OP-modified butyrylcholinesterase from biological or clinical samples.
PMC3325153	R04003	3A showed the structure and reaction path of butyrylcholinesterase and paraoxon after exposure.
PMC3325153	R05002	The intensity of unmodified butyrylcholinesterase peptide was reduced by more than three orders of magnitude following paraoxon treatment, indicating that the treatment led to a nearly complete level of phosphorylation on Ser198, in agreement with the observation of a complete inhibition of enzyme activity.
PMC3325153	R06000	We have also explored whether there are endogenous phosphorylation and other sites of OP-modifications within human BChE. With a sequence coverage of ~88% achieved, our data indicate that human butyrylcholinesterase does not contain any sites of endogenous phosphorylation and Ser198 is the only site for OP-modification induced by paraoxon treatment.
PMC3325153	R07006	Since antibody pulls down the whole BChE protein from human plasma, a number of other butyrylcholinesterase peptides (supplementary Table) were identified by MS/MS, supporting the confidence of our detection of modified-BChE in human plasma sample.

PMC3348551	I00000	Tobacco use is the single largest preventable cause of disease and premature death in the United States, accounting for at least 30% of cancer deaths.[1] The nearly 40% reduction in male lung cancer deaths between 1991 and 2003 has been attributed to smoking declines in the last half century.[2] 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a carcinogenic nitrosamine produced upon curing tobacco, is present at relatively high concentrations in tobacco smoke.[3] Therefore, it has been suggested that NNK is an important contributor to the etiology of lung and pancreatic cancer in smokers, oral cancer in smokeless tobacco users, and lung cancer in non-smokers exposed to environmental tobacco smoke.[4] The ketone that is present at C-1 of NNK is rapidly reduced to an alcohol in the lung primarily by aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) of the 1C family,[5] carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1), and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD1)[6] to give the carcinogenic NNAL metabolite (Fig. 1).

PMC3655873	I00002	Mechanisms driving these abnormalities are multifactorial including effects of ART (e.g., protease inhibitor (PI)-associated dyslipidemia and nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)-associated mitochondrial toxicity [2-4]), disease related factors (e.g., CD4 T-cell depletion, inflammation, and unsuppressed viremia), and host factors (e.g. body mass index, comorbidities, and genetic predisposition)

PMC3682342	D00001	Elevated serum 2HG levels in patients with IDH1 and IDH2 mutations have been described previously in several small AML cohorts13,14,18,36,37; however, the relationship between serum 2HG levels, isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, and patient outcome has not been defined previously.
PMC3682342	D01003	These data suggest that the LC-MS technique can detect minimal and nonpathologic levels of this metabolite in patients without isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations.

PMC3682342	I00000	Recurrent somatic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (isocitrate dehydrogenase) enzymes IDH1 and IDH2 have been identified in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other myeloid malignancies, with an estimated prevalence of 5% to 30%.1-9IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur more frequently in patients with normal karyotype and older age3,6,8,10 and are associated with co-occurring nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutations.2-4,11,12
PMC3682342	I01001	Somatic mutations within the IDH1 and IDH2 enzyme–active sites, specifically at codon R132 of IDH1 and codons R140 or R172 of IDH2, lead to a loss of function for the above-described reaction and yield a reverse reaction that reduces αKG to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) via the conversion of NAPDH to NADP+.13-17 2HG can be measured in patient serum, and 2HG levels correlate with the presence of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations in small cohorts of patients with AML.13,18,19
PMC3682342	I02000	Despite recent insights into the distinctive pathophysiologic characteristics of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, the role of 2HG elevations within neoplastic cells has not been firmly established.
PMC3682342	I02001	Recent studies suggest that increased 2HG levels function through competitive inhibition of αKG-dependent enzymatic activities, including ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2)–dependent DNA hydroxymethylation as well as histone demethylation, leading to dysregulated epigenetic programming.20,21 Activation of the HIF-1α pathway via inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases has also been implicated.15,22,23
PMC3682342	I03001	Improved scientific discernment of this pathway is important, especially given the ongoing development of targeted IDH modulators for clinical use.28,29 Moreover, a specific role for epigenetically targeted therapies, including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors, may be particularly efficacious in AML subsets characterized by isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations and by mutations in other genes implicated in epigenetic regulation.30,31
PMC3682342	I04001	However, a systematic analysis of 2HG as a predictor of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation status or to assess clinical response has not been performed.
PMC3682342	M01000	Serum was obtained from 62 E1900 patients with IDH mutations,11 identified by mutational analysis of coding exons with known somatic mutations using polymerase chain reaction amplification and bidirectional Sanger sequencing as described previously.13
PMC3682342	M01004	Analysts were blinded to the isocitrate dehydrogenase mutational status.
PMC3682342	M04001	The intrasample variation was most pronounced in samples with markedly elevated 2HG levels and did not affect the interpretation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase mutational status.
PMC3682342	R00005	Although the incidence of TET2 mutations was low overall, no patient with an identified isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation had a co-occurring TET2 mutation, as has been reported previously.11,20
PMC3682342	R01004	2HG levels were significantly higher in patients with IDH mutations, compared with patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type AML (P < .0005)
PMC3682342	R02001	We observed an association between an elevated WBC count and serum 2HG level of borderline significance (P = .057); when analyzing only isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, we identified a strong association between WBC count and elevated level of serum 2HG (P = .007) (Figure 2).
PMC3682342	R03002	Of note, 2HG levels in IDH2 R140 mutations did not differ significantly from the other isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations at baseline or after adjustment for WBC count, BM, or circulating blast percentage.
PMC3682342	R04001	Using ROC analysis, we identified a strong correlation between serum 2HG level and IDH mutations, with an area under the ROC curve between wild-type IDH and IDH mutations of 0.918 (Figure 4), and an optimal cutoff point of 700 ng/mL. When applying this discriminatory 700-ng/mL value, we found that the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of serum 2HG level for predicting isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations was 86.9% and 90.7%, respectively, with 89.6% of patients correctly classified.
PMC3682342	R05004	For all further statistical analyses, the 9 IDH wild-type samples with identified IDH mutations on subsequent sequencing were analyzed primarily within the isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type cohort (akin to an intention-to-treat analysis).
PMC3682342	R06003	Of note, no significant difference was found between median 2HG level in volunteers (48 ng/mL) with the median value of IDH wild-type AML samples (61 ng/mL; or 50 ng/mL if the 9 samples with identified isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations were excluded).
PMC3682342	R07000	Sera from 29 of the E1900 patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations at the time of CR (see supplemental Text for additional clinicopathologic characteristics of the remission cohort) revealed a median 2HG level of 95 ng/mL (range, 28-3149 ng/mL), compared with a median 2HG of 3234 ng/mL (range, 10-13 638 ng/mL) in these 29 patients at AML diagnosis.
PMC3682342	R08005	Because mutational analysis for isocitrate dehydrogenase at the time of CR was not performed, we cannot compare the sensitivity of serum 2HG with molecular tests for minimal residual disease (MRD).
PMC3682342	R11000	Finally, the level of serum 2HG was analyzed separately within the 3 IDH allelic mutant cohorts and was split by the median 2HG level observed in isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations (3004 ng/mL).

PMC3752669	I01006	Hence, two additional objectives of this study were to a) evaluate whether obesity was associated with elevated urinary PGE-M levels and (b) define the relationship between aging and levels of urinary PGE-M. We also postulated that use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), prototypic inhibitors of cyclooxygenase, would be associated with reduced levels of urinary PGE-M. Overall our findings suggest a significant role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and highlight the potential utility of urinary PGE-M as a biomarker of inflammation that could prove valuable in future intervention studies.

PMC3777223	M08003	The same protocol, but without sulfatase and p-nitrocatechol, was applied to evaluate only the diosmetin originating from glucuronide metabolites; in other tests the incubation was repeated also without glucuronidase and paracetamol-β-d-glucuronide in order to measure only diosmetin originating from sulfate conjugates (in such cases d-saccharic acid 1,4-lactone monohydrate was added; 0.02 mL at a concentration of 35 mg/mL, during incubation, to inhibit any possible residual glucuronidase activity).
PMC3777223	M10001	In the case when sulfatase was used, 0.05 mL of the incubated mixture were transferred in a mictrotiter plate, treated with 0.05 mL NaOH 1 M and the obtained p-nitrocatechol was measured at 490 nm to appreciate the desulfatation process efficiency against a standard of p-nitrocatechol in water (concentration of 0.32 mMol/L, corresponding to the expected levels of p-nitrocatechol achievable in the samples with a complete enzymatic degradation).

PMC3801077	I00003	Of note, gene mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) were reported recently not only in gliomas but also in AML (4, 5).
PMC3801077	I01005	Interestingly, 2-HG has been shown to competitively inhibit α-KG–dependent dioxygenases, such as the ten-eleven-translocation 2 (TET2) enzyme, and disturb the epigenetic regulatory network, leading to genome-wide histone and DNA damages with hypermethylation (12–14).
PMC3801077	I01007	2-HG can be metabolized by the enzyme 2-HG dehydrogenase (D2HGDH), but until now the possible contribution of genetic variants of this enzyme to the turnover of 2-HG has not yet been addressed.
PMC3801077	R05000	It has been established that D2HGDH and l-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (L2HGDH) are enzymes that convert 2-HG to α-KG.
PMC3801077	R05009	Meanwhile, there were no significant differences in the expression levels of D2HGDH (P = 0.49) or l-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (P = 0.31) between the two above groups.

PMC3813438	D06006	One possible explanation for the decline of phospholipid species during the EH-clamp in TCF7L2 risk allele carriers is that the high insulin concentrations induce sphingomyelinase, down-regulate SM synthase or induce PLA2/LCAT, leading to decreasing plasma concentration of SMs, lysoPCs and PCs.

PMC3813737	D06004	Basically, phosphatidic acid is dephosphorylated by a phosphatidate phosphatase.
PMC3813737	D06005	The resulting diacylglycerol can be directly acetylated by an acyltransferase to form a triacylglycerol or can react with cytidine-diphosphate-choline (CDP-choline) or CDP-ethanolamine to form phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively.
PMC3813737	D06006	Ethanolamine phosphate cytidylyltransferase and choline phosphate cytidylyltransferase homologs were identified in trypanosomatids [45].
PMC3813737	D08006	Arachidonic acid is subsequently metabolized via the following three pathways: (i) the cyclooxygenase (cyclooxygenase) pathway, forming prostaglandins, thromboxanes or prostacyclins; (ii) the various lipoxygenase (lipoxygenase) pathways, forming leukotrienes, lipoxins, hepoxilins, hydro(pero)xy and hydroxy fatty acids; and (iii) the cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) pathways, forming epoxy derivatives [52].

PMC3813737	D09005	The activity of extracellular folic acid is regulated by a folic acid synthase.
PMC3813737	D09007	T. cruzi is an auxotroph for folate and pteridine, which are imported through permeases.
PMC3813737	D09009	Dihydrofolate reductase (Dihydrofolate reductase) catalyzes the two-step reduction of folate to tetrahydrofolate, which is then transformed to N5, N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate and is used by thymidylate synthase (thymidylate synthase) as a methyl donor and reducing agent in the conversion of dUMP to dTMP.
PMC3813737	D10001	After salvage, pteridine precursors are reduced to their respective biologically active tetrahydro forms by the pteridine reductase PTR1.
PMC3813737	D10002	The DHFR-TS used by trypanosomatids can exclusively reduce folic acid; the reductase PTR1 shows a much broader range of activity, catalyzing successive reductions of conjugated (folate) and unconjugated (biopterin) pterins.
PMC3813737	D10004	Because of this compensatory mechanism, the development of any drug targeting the folate pathway in trypanosomatids should consider the inhibition of both Dihydrofolate reductase and PTR1 [62].

PMC4351578	D03004	However, if our global metabolomicsassessment of plasma sphingolipids reflects pulmonary cellular events, worse emphysemamay be linked to increased activity of both sphingomyelinase and recycling (fromgangliosides) pathways, followed by ceramide consumption/degradation, rather thanaccumulation (Figure 5), possibly via plasmaceramidases.
PMC4351578	D03005	Because plasma S1P was not increased and tended to be negatively correlatedwith emphysema and COPD exacerbations, unlike sphingosine, it is possible that thesphingolipid metabolism is accelerated toward ceramide production and degradation butinhibited at the level of sphingosine kinase activity (Figure 5).
PMC4351578	D03009	Similarly, the role ofmonohexosylceramides in the lung is unknown, but they were shown to bind to surfactantprotein D (28) and to decrease on activation ofacid sphingomyelinase and acid β-glucosidase1, as a sign of ceramide productionvia recycling from gangliosides during inflammation (29).
PMC4351578	D05002	Although the significance of this finding remains to be tested, theextracellular matrix protein CCN1/Cyr61 is activated by S1P via receptor 2 (32), which also activates rho kinase to cause lungdamage during cigarette smoke exposure (33,34).
PMC4351578	D05003	Other disrupted gene–metaboliteassociations of interest in those with severe COPD exacerbations were between ceramideand alkaline ceramidase, which degrades unsaturated long chain ceramides (35); ORMDL1, which regulates denovo ceramide biosynthesis, recently involved in asthma (36); and 3-ketodihydrosphingosine reductase, whichreduces 3-ketodihydrosphingosine to dihydrosphingosine (37).

PMC4368747	I00001	In the adjuvant setting, Exe, similar to the other third-generation compounds, revealed improved relapse-free survival compared to tamoxifen monotherapy when administered as sequential therapy.[7] Exe is the first steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) which inhibits in vivo formation of oestrogens (estrone and estradiol), thereby reducing stimulation for breast cancer cell proliferation.[8] Variability in response and side effect profile has been observed in patients in many AI clinical trials and the underlying mechanism remains undefined.[9–13] Recently, the major metabolic pathway of Exe has been delineated; as a reduction of double bond in 17 keto group via aldo-keto reductase (aldo-keto reductase) to form 17β-dihydroexemestane (17DhExe) is a major pathway for exemestane phase I metabolism.
PMC4368747	I00003	[15, 16] Inactivation of 17DhExe is catalysed by the enzyme UDP-gluconoryltransferase 2B17 (UGT2B17).
PMC4369926	D01005	These issues, coupled with general concerns over the reliability of E2 measurements [60], and the need for improved sensitivity to monitor aromatase inhibition [61], suggested the need for a more specific, sensitive, and reliable method for the analysis of E2 and its major metabolites to complement the high sensitivity method we developed for estrone and its metabolites [62].

PMC4373661	A03000	Phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency, previously identified as a glycogenosis, is also a congenital disorder of glycosylation.
PMC4373661	D00000	In our study, we found that phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency, which has been shown to be a glycogen storage disorder, is also a mixed-type congenital disorder of glycosylation.
PMC4373661	D01000	Extensive use of common protein polymorphisms of phosphoglucomutase 1 in paternity testing led to the discovery of a case of reduced enzyme activity in 1963, and since then additional cases of reduced phosphoglucomutase 1 activity have been described sporadically.8,17–22 In 2009, data on an adult with exercise-induced muscle cramps and episodes of rhabdomyolysis (Patient 8 in the current study) were reported.2 Abnormal glycogen accumulation was noted in the muscles, the level of phosphoglucomutase 1 activity was only 1% of the normal level, and mutations in PGM1 were identified.
PMC4373661	D01002	However, the broad clinical and biochemical spectrum of phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency remained unrecognized.
PMC4373661	D02001	This is probably explained by the fact that other isoenzymes substitute for phosphoglucomutase 1 in the brain (see the Supplementary Appendix).

PMC4373661	D06004	However, a systematic clinical study of the effects of galactose supplementation will be necessary to determine the extent to which such therapy can correct the clinical features of this condition; such studies will also incidentally help to define the pathogenesis of the individual elements of the clinical syndrome of phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency.

PMC4525490	D01012	Early tracing experiments using rat muscle in vitro indicate that glutamate, aspartate and specific branched amino acids (isoleucine and valine) should enter the TCA cycle and serve as carbon skeleton and nitrogen supply for glutamine synthesis7,8, however only the uptake pattern of glutamate has been previously reported38, The uptake pattern of serine, reflected as lower concentration in venous blood, is a new finding as well, which may imply its usage for pyruvate anaplerosis, as a non-carbohydrate precursor, by serine dehydratase mediated direct conversion to pyruvate (Fig. 6).

PMC4544761	A00000	The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to investigate whether activation of the renin-angiotensin system in renovascular disease affects the cytochrome P450 ω/ω-1 hydroxylase (20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [20-HETE]) and epoxygenase (epoxyeicosatrienoic acids [EETs]) pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism in vivo, each of which interacts with angiotensin II.
PMC4544761	A00006	Total plasma EETs were lowest, as was the ratio of plasma EETs to plasma dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids, an index of epoxide hydrolase activity, in renovascular disease (ratio: 2.4; range: 1.2 to 6.1) compared with essential hypertension (ratio: 3.4; range: 1.5 to 5.6) and control subjects (ratio: 6.8; range: 1.4 to 18.8; P<0.01).
PMC4544761	D01002	Ang II can activate the release of renal 20-HETE by stimulating the synthesis of 20-HETE at critical sites in the kidney: the preglomerular microvessels that determine renovascular resistance7,8,17,32 and a nephron segment, the medullary thick ascending limb, that contributes decisively to salt and water balance.29 The pressor response to increases in circulating Ang II can be attenuated by inhibition of 20-HETE synthesis.7 Furthermore, overexpression of an ω-hydroxylase isozyme, which increased the production of 20-HETE in blood vessels, caused endothelial dysfunction.33
PMC4544761	D02004	By way of contrast, 20-HETE, which inhibits Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter activity in the TAL,37 will promote Na+ reabsorption and elevate blood pressure when deficient, as in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat.38 The 4 isoforms/isozymes of ω-hydroxylase that synthesize 20-HETE29 are differentially localized in the kidney and individually regulated, eg, the 4A8 isoform is regulated by testosterone.39
PMC4544761	D02005	In addition, catalytic activities of the individual ω- and ω-1-hydroxylase isozymes vary by as much as 40-fold.29
PMC4544761	D03002	The elevated plasma concentrations of 20-HETE in RVD occurred with decreased urinary excretion of 20-HETE (Figure 1A through 1C) and probably reflects the multiple pathways for disposition of 20-HETE, namely, incorporation of 20-HETE into phospholipids, ω- and β-oxidation, and transformation of 20-HETE via cyclooxygenase into prostaglandin analogs.41,42
PMC4544761	D04000	EETs in blood are primarily acylated at the sn2 position of phospholipids and capable of being released by phospholipase A2.23 EETs are avidly incorporated into cellular phospholipids and “released at rates exceeding those for arachidonic acid.
PMC4544761	D05001	Vascular-free EETs can be increased by release from endothelial phospholipids; eg, bradykinin stimulates phospholipase activity to increase unbound EETs that exert antipressor effects by relaxing vascular smooth muscle.46 On the other hand, the low levels of tissue/plasma EET concentrations in RVD may result from Ang II upregulating vascular endothelial soluble epoxide hydrolase activity.19 Diminished EET levels will augment 20-HETE vasoconstrictor activity, because 11,12-EET functions as a physiological antagonist of 20-HETE.47 Deficiency of 11,12-EET has also been linked to salt-sensitive hypertension, because 11,12-EET inhibits the epithelial sodium channel in the rat collecting duct.48 Moreover, impairment of 11,12-EET synthesis in mice produced by disruption of the gene-controlling EET synthase caused salt-sensitive hypertension.49
PMC4544761	D06005	Finally, the reduced ratio of plasma EETs: DHETs (Figure 2C) in RVD and EH subjects; vis a vis control subjects, suggests increased soluble epoxide hydrolase activity that will reduce EET levels and, thereby, decrease antipressor activity in RVD and EH (Figure 2A).

PMC4544761	I00000	In the past 2 decades, the view that the cytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism affects blood pressure and contributes to the development of hypertension is supported by studies in several experimental models.1,2
PMC4544761	I00001	However, little information is available on possible contributions of cytochrome P450 products to essential hypertension (EH) and human renal vascular hypertension.3
PMC4544761	I01000	cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are expressed in the renal vasculature and nephron,5 generating primarily 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) by ω- and ω-1 hydroxylases and 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by epoxygenases.
PMC4544761	I01002	For example, the rat 2C23 epoxygenase isozyme responds to a salt load by increasing expression and activity to augment synthesis of antipressor EETs.6 20-HETE exhibits both pressor and antipressor activities.7,8 20-HETE mediates renal circulatory autoregulation9 and contributes to pressure natriuresis.10 One or more EETs may serve as endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factors.11,12 EETs are metabolized rapidly by epoxide hydrolases to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), which are generally viewed as biologically inactive with a few exceptions.13 Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (soluble epoxide hydrolase) produces increased EETs with decreased blood pressure in experimental and genetic hypertension in rats 14–16
PMC4544761	I02000	Ang II stimulates 20-HETE synthesis in renal microvessels7,17 and decreases EET levels by downregulating epoxygenases and increasing their degradation by increasing expression and activity of sEH.18,19
PMC4544761	I02001	These studies provide the rationale to the hypothesis that occasioned the present study; namely, metabolism of AA via CYP monooxygenases is altered in renovascular disease (RVD).
PMC4544761	I02002	To assess whether altered generation of eicosanoids derived from cytochrome P450 AA metabolism occurs with activation of the renin-angiotensin system, we set up a cross-sectional study to measure 20-HETE, EET, and DHET levels in plasma and urine by paired analyses in hypertensive subjects with RVD that were compared with these levels in normotensive control subjects and those with EH.
PMC4544761	R03001	An estimation of the relative total epoxygenase activity of the 3 groups tested is available by obtaining the sum of plasma EETs+DHETs for each group, which was also significantly correlated with hypertensive status; viz, control 32.5; EH 30.4; and RVD 18 ng/mL plasma (rs=0.39; P=0.035; Figure 2C).
PMC4544761	R03004	The exception was the EH group, which exhibited plasma levels of free EETs between 0.9 and 10 ng/mL of plasma (4.7± 1.1 ng/mL of plasma, mean±SD), perhaps reflecting the reported increase in activity of plasma phospholipase A2 in hypertensive rats.27

PMC4564198	A00004	We identified and replicated 22 loci with significant associations with urinary traits, 15 of which are new (HIBCH, CPS1, AGXT, XYLB, TKT, ETNPPL, SLC6A19, DMGDH, SLC36A2, GLDC, SLC6A13, ACSM3, SLC5A11, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, SLC13A3).
PMC4564198	D08001	Interestingly, at the time when we received the first results from our association studies this gene was named AGXT2L1 and was assumed to encode an alanine-glyoxylate-aminotransferase.
PMC4564198	D08004	Meanwhile, Veiga-da-Cunha et al. experimentally investigated the locus in an independent study and found that AGXT2L1 actually encodes an ethanolaminephosphate-phospholyase [59].
PMC4564198	D08006	As ethanolamine is a direct precursor of ethanolaminephosphate via ethanolamine kinase (EC 2.7.1.28), our finding indeed matches the actual gene function.
PMC4564198	D09001	According to our evidence-based locus to gene assignment, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD) is the most probable effector gene candidate.
PMC4564198	D09003	Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no obvious, known biological link between 2-HIBA and the hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase gene or any of the remaining 8 genes covered by this locus.
PMC4564198	D09012	SETD1B is a component of the methyltransferase complex that specifically methylates the lysine-4 residue of histone H3 [67].
PMC4564198	D09015	Thus, one could speculate that in addition to its activity as a histone methylase, SETD1B may also be involved in the newly discovered process of histone hydroxyisobutyrylation, a hypothesis that may now be tested by dedicated experiments.
PMC4564198	D10004	However, there is an alternative metabolic pathway in which D-xylulose is metabolized by phosphofructokinase (phosphofructokinase) (S3 Fig)
PMC4564198	D10007	Thus, the genetic variants in XYLB might reduce the enzymatic activity of xylulokinase and thereby cause a shift towards the alternative pathway.
PMC4564198	D11003	In case of the 14 loci with overlapping associations between blood and urine in our study (Table 3), 6 target the same metabolite in both media (CPS1, AGXT2, DMGDH, SLC6A13, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, SLC5A11).
PMC4564198	D11010	In case of the remaining 3 loci, we find no direct biochemical or metabolic relationship between the metabolites in both media, since AGXT associates with an unknown compound in blood, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase associates with amino acids in urine and HDL cholesterol in blood, and SLC6A20 targets loosely related amino acid derivatives.
PMC4564198	D12000	As an example for parallel effects in blood and urine, we identified an association between variants in the Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthetase 1 (CPS1) gene and elevated urinary glycine levels.

PMC4564198	R04014	One of these genes is NAT8, which encodes an N-acetyltransferase.
PMC4564198	R04016	According to our evidence-based candidate genes assignment approach, the 23 loci map to the genes NAT8, HIBCH, CPS1, AGXT, XYLB, SLC6A20, TKT, ETNPPL, SLC6A19, AGXT2, DMGDH, SLC36A2, NAT2, ABO, GLDC, PYROXD2, SLC6A13, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, ACSM3, SLC5A11, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, SLC7A9, and SLC13A3.
PMC4564198	R05006	For 10 of these 19 loci (CPS1, SLC6A20, ETNPPL, SLC6A19, AGXT2, SLC36A2, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, ACSM3, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, and SLC13A3), the match between the association signal and the NMR spectrum of the candidate metabolite (as provided by the Urine Metabolome Database [54]) is strong and unique, which makes the assignment of a metabolite identity to a non-targeted trait unambiguous in these cases.
PMC4564198	R08000	For 15 of the 22 loci, no associations with urinary metabolic traits were reported so far (HIBCH, CPS1, AGXT, XYLB, TKT, ETNPPL, SLC6A19, DMGDH, SLC36A2, GLDC, SLC6A13, ACSM3, SLC5A11, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, and SLC13A3) (Fig 3, Table 3).
PMC4564198	R08001	The remaining 7 loci were already identified in our previous urine mGWAS (AGXT2, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, SLC7A9, SLC6A20, and NAT2)
PMC4564198	R09002	For 3 of these 14 loci (SLC6A20, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, AGXT), we consider the associated metabolic traits in both media to be unrelated.
PMC4564198	R09004	In 6 cases, the associations target the same metabolites in urine and blood (CPS1, AGXT2, DMGDH, SLC6A13, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, SLC5A11).

PMC4581424	M06002	The normal ranges were: albumin, 35–50 g/L; total bilirubin, 3.4–20.5 mmol/L; ALT, <55 U/L; AST, 5–34 U/L; GGT, 12–64 U/L (men) and 9–36 U/L (women); and AP, 40–150 U/L.

PMC4582777	M03002	Then, the urine was spiked with sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5, 1 M, 1 mL) containing β-glucuronidase/sulfatase (3000 unit β-glucuronidase and 100 unit sulfatase activity/mL buffer) and ascorbic acid solution (10 μL, 250 mg/mL).
PMC4582777	R03003	This method used overnight hydrolysis of urine samples (1 mL) with 10 mg enzyme (3000 unit β-glucuronidase activity and 100 unit sulfatase activity) to reach complete deconjugation of all OH-PAHs [46].

PMC4772340	D02004	It has been suggested that a genetic variant in one of the enzymes catalyzing the final step in the synthesis of KYNA, kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) III, is responsible [46].
PMC4772340	D02005	Reduced expression or activity of the kynurenine aminotransferase III enzyme might thus lead to diminished synthesis of KYNA and consequently an imbalance between KYNA and QUIN [14, 15, 32, 33, 46].

PMC4794249	A00001	We hypothesised that the reportedly lower aerobic performance in non-carriers compared to carriers of the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele, i.e. ACE-DD vs. ACE-ID/ACE-II genotype, is associated with alterations in activity-induced glucose metabolism and capillarisation in exercise muscle.
PMC4794249	A02000	Cycling exercise reduced muscle glycogen concentration and this tended to be affected by the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele (p = 0.09).
PMC4794249	A03000	The observations imply a genetically modulated role for angiotensin converting enzyme in control of glucose import and oxidation in working skeletal muscle.
PMC4794249	D03005	Support for the angiotensin converting enzyme I/D polymorphism-dependent modification of glucose metabolism in working muscle was presented by a reduced RER during the exhaustive exercise in ACE-DD genotypes (Figs ​(Figs11 and ​and2).2).
PMC4794249	D04001	None of these factors demonstrated a significant effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme I/D genotype.
PMC4794249	D05004	These findings, together with the observed indication for reduced aerobic energy metabolism in ACE-DD genotypes, are compatible with the idea that under the studied conditions the lack of the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele is associated with a reduced oxidative carbon flux in exercised muscle resulting from an imbalance between anaplerosis and cataplerosis.
PMC4794249	D06008	Overall the present novel findings lead us to the interpretation that the lack of an angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele, in the studied subjects, is a disadvantageous condition for aerobic energy metabolism during and after endurance work which is compensated by a shift in energy production to metabolic alternatives of glucose oxidation.

PMC4794249	I01010	Collectively, the findings highlight an important role of the angiotensin converting enzyme system in the regulation of glucose metabolism in muscle with exercise.
PMC4794249	I02001	We reasoned that differences in metabolic reactions in working muscle should exist between carriers and non-carriers of the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele and would relate to a modulated muscle capillarisation and exercise response of angiotensin 2 levels in serum.
PMC4794249	R01002	The serum concentration of glucose, but not triglyceride, lipoprotein and ketone concentration was increased in ACE-DD genotypes after the exercise and this differed to the response of subjects with the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele (S1 Table, Fig 1A).
PMC4794249	R02000	Serum concentration of the angiotensin converting enzyme product, angiotensin 2, was higher in ACE-DD genotypes than in ACE-II and ID genotypes before (29.0 ± 3.1 vs. 6.5 ± 2.2 pg/ml, p = 0.01), but not after (24.2 ± 3.1 vs. 28.2 ± 18.8 pg/ml, p = 0.45), the one-legged cycling exercise.

PMC5031239	A00010	Conclusions: Although increased lipogenesis, desaturases, and lipoxygenase activities characterize NAFL and NASH, impaired peroxisomal polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism and nonenzymatic oxidation is associated with progression to NASH.
PMC5031239	D01001	Specifically, the increments in palmitoleic acid (16:1 n7) and its downstream product vaccenic acid (18:1 n7) suggest increased activity of the Δ 9 stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Figs. 1 and ​and2C),2C), a sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c target.25–27 This is further corroborated by the significant increase in palmitoleic acid (16:1n7): palmitic acid (16:0), and oleic acid (18:1n9):stearic acid (18:0) ratios in NAFL and NASH along with unchanged or decreased levels of downstream metabolites (arichidenic [20:0], behenic [22:0], and lignoceric [24:0] acids) along the long chain fatty acid elongase pathway (Fig. 2C).
PMC5031239	D03003	We therefore interpret these data to indicate increased utilization of the essential fatty acids by Δ6 desaturase as evidenced by increased levels of its downstream metabolites (Fig.
PMC5031239	D05000	Another novel finding of potential pathophysiological importance is evidence of systemic lipoxygenase rather than COX activation in this study.
PMC5031239	D05001	Although the products of cyclooxygenase activation were not significantly altered, there was an increase in products of 5-LOX, 8-LOX, and 15-LOX that were maximal in subjects with NASH.
PMC5031239	D07000	Taken together, these data indicate that the development of NAFL is accompanied by increased lipogenesis, Δ9 desaturase, and LOX activity (Fig. 6).
PMC5031239	D07001	With progression to NASH, the lipogenic activity levels off or declines modestly, whereas the lipoxygenase activity increases.

PMC5031239	R00002	Compared with lean normal controls, subjects with NAFL and NASH had higher aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels, lower high-density lipoprotein, higher low-density lipoprotein, and higher triglycerides.
PMC5031239	R04002	There was also a significant decrease in stearic acid (18:0) levels and a concomitant increase in its downstream product oleic (18:1 n9) in the Δ9 steroyl CoA desaturase (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) pathway, within DAG in both NAFL and NASH.
PMC5031239	R06004	Simultaneously, the downstream products of stearic acid (18:0) along the long chain elongase pathway were decreased (NAFL) or unchanged (NASH), suggesting greater movement of stearate along the Δ 9 stearoyl-CoA desaturase rather than the elongase pathway.
PMC5031239	R08001	Gamma-linolenic (18:3n6) and dihomo γ-linolenic (20:3n6) acids, the downstream metabolites of linoleic acid (18:2n6), were considerably increased (P < 0.001 for most lipid classes) in subjects with both NAFL and NASH, suggestive of increased Δ 6 desaturase (Δ6DS) activity (Fig.
PMC5031239	R11000	The levels of cycloxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) products of AA (20:4 n6) in circulation were measured next.
PMC5031239	R11001	The plasma levels of cyclooxygenase products of AA (prostaglandin [PG]-M, PGB2, PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, and thromboxane A2) were not significantly different across the three study groups.
PMC5031239	R11002	In sharp contrast, many of the products of the lipoxygenase pathway were significantly higher in NASH patients in comparison with the NAFL or normal group (Fig.
PMC5037848	D04001	Possible explanations for this effect include differences in the diet of smokers as well as more direct causal effects of smoking, such as the inhibition of lipoprotein lipase by nicotine, which could result in reduced lipid clearance [39,40].

PMC5037848	D15002	For subjects who used statins to reduce cholesterol levels via inhibition of HMCoA-reductase (the majority of the study population), this effect could be related to the enhancing effects of statins on the conversion of linoleic acid to its PUFA derivatives [76,77].

PMC5120887	D01006	Indeed, patients with very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) deficiency, the enzyme responsible for the catabolism of fatty acids with an acyl chain length between 14 and 18 carbons, exhibit cardiac hypertrophy.[34] Moreover, blood profiles from animals and patients with very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency are characterized by large accumulations of long chain acyl carnitines.[35,36]
PMC5120887	D02002	Increased expression of the truncated PPARα is associated with decreased expression of the PPARα target genes involved in fatty acid transport and oxidation.[18] Moreover, decreased PPARα expression and/or activity in the heart could be linked to the development of local inflammation and fibrosis.[39] Supporting the concept that defects in fatty acid transport and oxidation play an important role in ventricular hypertrophy is the fact that mutations in the fatty acyl translocase CD36, a plasma membrane transporter involved in the uptake of long chain fatty acids by cardiomyocytes, have been linked to cases of inherited hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.[40] Further, the inhibition of myocardial fatty acid metabolism has been reported as an independent predictor of the cardiac hypertrophic response in hypertensive patients evaluated by PET scan.[22]

PMC5243144	A00000	We recently showed that the anaplerotic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (PC) is up-regulated in human breast cancer tissue and its expression is correlated with the late stages of breast cancer and tumor size [Phannasil et al., PloS
PMC5243144	A00009	The data indicate that the major metabolic roles of pyruvate carboxylase in invasive breast cancer are primarily anaplerosis, pyruvate cycling and mitochondrial biosynthesis of precursors of cellular components required for breast cancer cell growth and replication.
PMC5243144	D00002	We and others have shown that PC mRNA and pyruvate carboxylase protein are up-regulated in many cancers [7–10].
PMC5243144	D01005	A similar disturbance of common metabolites was observed in both moderate and strong pyruvate carboxylase suppression MDA-MB-231-derived cells as shown in Table 3 and Figs. 5 and ​and66.
PMC5243144	D02001	The product of the PC reaction is oxaloacetate, which immediately condenses with acetyl-CoA to produce citrate or is converted to malate in the mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase reaction.
PMC5243144	D02004	This indicates that pyruvate carboxylase knockdown inhibits anaplerosis from both pyruvate carboxylation and glutaminolysis.
PMC5243144	D03004	In the pyruvate-malate shuttle PC converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate followed by the conversion of oxaloacetate to malate by mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, enabling malate to exit mitochondria.
PMC5243144	D03007	The oxaloacetate is then reduced to malate catalyzed by cytosolic malate dehydrogenase.
PMC5243144	D03011	In addition, the acetyl-CoA derived from the ATP citrate lyase reaction can be converted to malonyl-CoA and utilized for lipid synthesis in the cytosol.
PMC5243144	D03013	In the PC knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells, the depleted levels of malate and citrate caused by the chronic suppression of pyruvate carboxylase may slow down the overall pyruvate cycling rate, resulting in the low level of pyruvate (Fig. 7).
PMC5243144	D04001	The shRNA nucleotide sequence used to target the PC mRNA was not similar to any of the nucleotide sequence of the malic enzyme mRNA indicating the lower level of the malic enzyme was not due to an off target effect of pyruvate carboxylase targeting.
PMC5243144	D05001	8) and lower glucose carbon incorporation into palmitate (Fig. 9) are consistent with the anaplerotic/cataplerotic role of pyruvate carboxylase in growth of breast cancer cells.
PMC5243144	D06000	Transamination of oxaloacetate with glutamate catalyzed by aspartate aminotransferase would produce aspartate.
PMC5243144	D06004	In renal adenocarcinoma and paraganglioma cancers harboring loss of function mutations of succinate dehydrogenase, PC was found essential to support cancer proliferation [22,23].
PMC5243144	D06010	Similar to our study, the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) also showed reduction of glucose- and glutamine- derived CTP and UTP levels [9].
PMC5243144	D07000	The marked reduction of serine and glycine levels in the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cells may underlie the retarded growth phenotype of the knockdown cells because serine contributes to various biosynthetic pathways including protein synthesis, phospholipids and nucleotides which are in high demand during tumorigenesis [24].
PMC5243144	D08002	The first reaction is the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate by phosphoglycerate dehydro genase followed by further conversion to 3-phosphoserine by phosphoserine aminotransferase before the final conversion to serine by protein serine phosphatase.
PMC5243144	D08004	Because glutamate is produced from α-ketoglutarate via a transamination reaction, the lowered level of α-ketoglutarate in the PC-knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 10) may in turn lower the rate of glutamate formation which consequently affects the transamination reaction catalyzed by phosphoserine aminotransferase.
PMC5243144	D08007	Suppression of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase expression in invasive breast cancer cells also reduces the level of α-ketoglutarate which is produced from the transamination of glutamate [26].
PMC5243144	D08008	These findings mirror the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells that showed lowered levels of α-ketoglutarate and serine in the current study.
PMC5243144	D09000	Lowered levels of total cellular acetyl-CoA in the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cell lines can most likely be attributed to decreased export of citrate from mitochondria causing decreased citrate available for conversation to oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA catalyzed by ATP citrate lyase in the cytosol.
PMC5243144	D10000	In addition to the lowered levels of certain mitochondrial metabolites, pyruvate cycling and nucleotide synthesis, we also found that suppression of PC causes a reduction of glucose incorporation into palmitate (Fig. 9), suggesting that inhibition of anaplerosis caused by pyruvate carboxylase knockdown results in lower fatty acid synthesis which restricts membrane biogenesis of the newly dividing cells.
PMC5243144	D11000	Suppression of PC only slightly and insignificantly lowered the concentrations of ATP and ADP without affecting the ATP/ADP ratio and NAD(P)(H) concentrations (Fig. 11) indicating suppression of pyruvate carboxylase did not seriously affect the cell energy charge.

PMC5243144	R04008	This indicates that the +3 labeled malate came from oxaloacetate formed in the PC reaction and the +2 labeled malate came from the citric acid cycle after the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction produced +2 labeled acetyl-CoA that was incorporated into citrate that then became +2 labeled malate after flux through the citrate-pyruvate cycle or through the citric acid cycle.
PMC5243144	R04009	13C5 labeled glutamine produced mostly +4 labeled citrate and malate that entered mitochondrial metabolism through α-ketoglutarate derived from glutamate in the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction.
PMC5243144	R04010	The decreased 13C incorporation into malate and citrate from glucose and glutamine in the PC 2096 4B cell line can be explained by pyruvate carboxylase knockdown inhibiting pyruvate flux through the citrate-pyruvate and the malate-pyruvate cycles.
PMC5243144	R05002	2096 4B and pyruvate carboxylase 179 1A, showed decreased levels of malate and citrate compared to the control cell line containing a scrambled shRNA (Fig. 6).
PMC5243144	R06009	Alternatively in the pyruvate-citrate shuttle, citrate can exit mitochondria and be converted to oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA by ATP-citrate lyase [18,19].
PMC5243144	R06010	Oxaloacetate can then be converted to malate by cytosolic malate dehydrogenase.
PMC5243144	R06015	7A and B) can only be explained by a decreased activity of pyruvate cycling due to decreased pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity.

PMC5243144	R08001	Most of the +2 labeled acetyl-CoA would be expected to come from the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction.
PMC5243144	R08003	The lower concentrations of total cellular acetyl-CoA (Fig. 7C) and lower 13C incorporation into acetyl-CoA (Fig. 7D) in the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cells are consistent with a lower cytosolic level of acetyl-CoA resulting from decreased formation of mitochondrial citrate and its export to the cytosol via the pathway that uses ATP citrate lyase shown in Fig. 4.
PMC5243144	R09002	Aspartate is produced directly from oxaloacetate catalyzed by aspartate aminotransferase.
PMC5243144	R09006	Both PC 847 2C and pyruvate carboxylase 2096
PMC5243144	R10004	This is consistent with pyruvate carboxylase suppression inhibiting the mitochondrial synthesis of citrate and consequently the export of citrate to the cytosol thus lowering the supply of cytosolic acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA needed for fatty acid synthesis as depicted in Fig. 4.
PMC5243144	R11002	In addition to the metabolites discussed above moderate or strong suppression of PC resulted in the decreased levels of α-ketoglutarate, ADP-glucose, GDP-fucose and GDP-mannose while decreases in the levels of ribose-5-phosphate, CTP, hypoxanthine, UDP and GDP were observed only in the strong PC suppression cell line pyruvate carboxylase 2096 4B (Fig. 10 and Table 3).
PMC5243144	R12003	The levels of NADH and NAD+ including NADH/NAD+ ratios were not different between the knockdown cells and the scramble control (Fig. 11) also indicating that the energy charge of the cell was not affected by pyruvate carboxylase not down.
PMC5243144	R13001	As shown in Fig. 4, these included cytosolic malic enzyme, NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase, ATP-citrate lyase, glutamate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase and citrate synthase.
PMC5243144	R13009	Unfortunately the cell line PC 2096 4B with one of the lowest levels of pyruvate carboxylase and that was used for mass spectrometry studies would not grow after having been stored frozen so that the enzyme activities could not be measured in this cell line.

PMC5417077	A00009	These findings indicate that glutamate is an important marker of cancer metabolism whose regulation via glutaminase works in concert with aldehyde dehydrogenase to mediate cancer stemness.

PMC5875996	D01005	As one example, the amount of O-phosphoethanolamine was 2.7-fold increased after a 6-h incubation of blood, which can be interpreted by platelet-released sphingosine-1-phosphate in the sphingolipid signaling pathway, generating O-phosphoethanolamine by sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase activity [28] [EC 4.1.2.27].
PMC5875996	D01006	Upon extended serum storage (24 h), the amount of O-phosphoethanolamine was reduced by 80% compared with control samples, probably due to degradation by phosphoethanolamine/phosphocholine phosphatase activity [EC 3.1.3.75].

PMC6136796	R03005	The C-4 demethylation in two nonconsecutive steps is a feature of land plants.[12] In this work, by using molecular probes with the corresponding MOA, we mapped enzymatic steps downstream of CYP51, including sterol C8→C7-double bond isomerization, catalyzed by ERG2, and sterol C24-methylation, catalyzed by sterol C24-methyltransferase (ERG6).

PMC6143519	R09004	Whilst the actual meaning of GABR to functional arginine availability within cells can only be inferred, this observation shows that whilst arginine levels are stable in the first few hours after surgery, its relative availability (GABR) may increase at these time points potentially via reduced arginase activity directly following surgery.

PMC6181287	D02003	Increased 5α reductase activity in PCOS has been suggested from clinical studies [15,25], and was also suggested from immunohistochemical studies looking at ovarian tissues [13].
PMC6181287	D02004	In our study, we found an increase in 21-hydroxylase, 11β-hydroxylase, 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase (Δ4) as well as 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in PCOS (Fig 1).
PMC6181287	D02005	By contrast, we found no clear difference for 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity.
PMC6181287	D03003	As 5α reductase activity is essential to yield androgen precursor metabolites for DHT production, this indicates that in PCOS an increase in BMI will enhance 5α-dependent androgen production.
PMC6181287	D04000	Concerning 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities, we found an increased type 2 and decreased type 1 activity, but no change in absolute cortisol excretion.
PMC6181287	D04004	[25,28], while our study revealed diminished 20αHSD and 20β-HSD activities, but an increase in 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity assessed by the conversion of αTHF and THF to 20αDHF.
PMC6181287	D04005	20α-HSD activity is mainly promoted by AKR1C1, but may also be promoted by any other member of the AKR1C superfamily of aldo/keto reductases, which are also known as 3αHSDs.
PMC6181287	D04011	Thus increased 3αHSD activity might be characteristic for hyperandrogenic PCOS similar to increased 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase activity and 5α reductase activity.

PMC6181287	R02006	3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) activity seemed lower in PCOS, but this association to PCOS disappeared after multivariable adjustment.
PMC6181287	R02007	By contrast, a higher enzyme activity was found in PCOS for the activities of 11β-hydroxylase, and the Δ4-pathway activity of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, as well as for the P450 oxidoreductase activity.
PMC6181287	R02009	Similarly, no clear difference was found for the ratio yielding androgen synthesis through the backdoor pathway or for 5α reductase activity.
PMC6181287	R02010	A lower activity in PCOS was found for aromatase after adjusting for age and BMI.

PMC6318037	D01001	One possible explanation for the differential effects of TDO as compared to AhR inhibition is that the effect of tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase activity on CD8 T cells is due to the combined effects of both tryptophan depletion and kynurenine secretion.
PMC6318037	D02009	In a previous study, we found that expression of KYNU, the gene encoding kynureninase (an enzyme downstream of TDO) is elevated in suspended TNBC cell lines and in the context of increased inflammatory signaling (10), which would be consistent with tryptophan catabolism further down the pathway.
PMC6318037	D02012	Development of better antibodies to measure tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase or gauge activity will be a significant hurdle to overcome in the quest for biomarkers indicative of patients who may benefit from tryptophan catabolism-targeted therapies.

PMC6318037	I01000	We previously discovered that aberrant expression and activity of the hepatic tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) in TNBC cell lines supports anchorage-independent cell growth and late-stage metastasis through an autocrine mechanism, whereby the tryptophan catabolite kynurenine activates the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in the breast cancer cells (10).
PMC6318037	I01002	Most studies have focused on the tryptophan catabolizing enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in cancer, and current inhibitors of this pathway in clinical trials only target IDO activity.
PMC6318037	I01005	Importantly, recent negative clinical trial results in melanoma (the ECHO-301 trial) and pancreatic cancer (ECHO-203), suggest that indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase inhibitors are not sufficient for the reversal of tumor immune evasion (14) and indicate that it may be necessary to target tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase as well.
PMC6318037	R01008	While SUS CM again increased CD8 T cell death, this effect was significantly abrogated when SUS cells were treated with TDO inhibitor 680C91 (Figure 2D), suggesting that tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase activity is at least partially responsible for the CM effect.

PMC6335671	I00008	5'-DFUR would be preferably metabolized to 5-FU in tumor tissue by activity-enhanced thymidine phosphorylase with more than 10 times higher concentration of product compared with other normal tissue [4].
PMC6335671	I00010	It had been reported that approximately 80% of 5-FU is catabolized to inactive product dihydrofluorouracil (FUH2) by the rate-limiting enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD) in liver, and declined activity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase often caused a longer retention of 5-FU [5–7].
PMC6335671	I00012	The antitumor activity of 5-FU usually worked through three metabolic pathways: the first pathway was the anabolism of 5-FU to fluorouridine triphosphate and incorporating the product into RNA, and finally damage the structure of RNA; the second pathway was similar with the first mechanism and deoxyfluorouridine triphosphate was produced to damage the DNA structure; the third way was anabolism of fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate from fluorouridine monophosphate or 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (2'-DFUR), and then a ternary complex would be formed with thymidylate synthetase and folic acid to suppress the synthesis of thymidine.

PMC6352090	A00004	Results: Our results showed that serum putrescine, directly generated from ornithine by the catalytic action of the biosynthetic enzyme ornithine decarboxylase, was significantly elevated in patients with T2D compared to those without T2D, and that it significantly correlated with the levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c).

PMC6365407	D02002	Both rat and human studies show that the kidney is the main site of serine production.42 Although some serine is produced by regeneration from glycine (15%), most (>50%) comes from TCA-cycle intermediates that are converted into phosphoenolpyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.41 Serine is required for cellular and tissue growth in general and for the nervous system in particular.43 It acts as neurotransmitters, is important for the catalytic activity of many enzymes, and is an important building block of many lipids.
PMC6365407	D04001	In general, the first step from tyrosine to L-DOPA, which is catalyzed by tyrosine hydroxylase, is regarded as the rate-limited step in this process.

PMC6857457	D04000	Impairment of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation has been associated with elevated circulating fatty acid derivatives such as acylcarnitines and reduced ketone bodies in plasma.25,32 Fatty acid β-oxidation is a multistep process that involves entry of the fatty acid into the cytosol, activation to acyl-CoA by conjugation with coenzyme A in the cytosol, conversion to acylcarnitine by the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane by the transporter carnitine translocase, and then conversion back to acyl-CoA by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-2 inside the mitochondrion, where fatty acid oxidation (β-oxidation) takes place (Figure 6A).35
PMC6857457	D05005	Likewise, there is evidence that circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine levels increase in conditions of oxidative stress.44,45 Asymmetric dimethylarginine is a product of methylation of arginine residues in proteins by the action of protein-arginine methyltransferases.46 Because more than 90% of asymmetric dimethylarginine generated is metabolized by dimethylargine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH),47 hepatic DDAH activity is an important determinant of circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine levels.48,49 DDAH is known to be highly sensitive to oxidative stress because of the presence of sulfhydryl groups at the active site, and it has been shown that oxidative stress inactivates this enzyme by modifying critical cysteine residues in its active site.50,51 As such, inactivation of dimethylargine dimethylaminohydrolase because of irinotecan-induced oxidative stress may lead to the accumulation of asymmetric dimethylarginine in the liver, which would be subsequently released into circulation (Figure 7C).
PMC6857457	D05007	The conversion of methionine to cysteine is rate-limited by cystathionine β-synthase, whose activity is regulated by the redox balance.55,56 Under conditions of oxidative stress, activation of cystathionine β-synthase would enhance conversion of methionine to cystathionine and then cysteine, leading to enhanced synthesis of glutathione, which serves as an autocorrective response to an oxidative insult (Figure 7D).29 Interestingly, N-α-acetyllysine was identified as the most significantly changed amino acid metabolite on irinotecan/SN-38 exposure in both patient plasma and HepatoCells medium.
PMC6857457	D05008	The acetylation of lysine residues in proteins has been known as an important mechanism of epigenetics, whereby histone acetyltransferases catalyze the addition of acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA onto the lysine residues of histones and nonhistone proteins.

PMC6947028	D00003	The phase 2 REGOMA trial investigating the multikinase inhibitor REG in recurrent glioblastoma sparked hope for the successful employment of a targeted therapy approach in gliomas [14].

PMC6948762	A03001	Renal acetyl-CoA carboxylase activation accompanies these lipidomic changes and suggests that it may be the underlying mechanism linking lipid abnormalities to DKD progression.
PMC6948762	D01004	Importantly, the ability to perform integrative renal gene expression with serum lipids has uncovered acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) activation as a critical determinant.
PMC6948762	D01006	Not all patients with diabetes develop DKD; therefore, the possible contribution of acetyl-CoA carboxylase polymorphisms to renal outcomes needs to be investigated.
PMC6948762	D03008	Overall, the main renal toxicities are determined by saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate, through mechanisms that involve activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTOR1) signaling pathways.
PMC6948762	D03011	Within the tubulointerstitial compartment, palmitate upregulates the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, leading to intracellular activation of DAG followed by protein kinase C (PKC), which further promotes renal tubular cell injury (43).
PMC6948762	D03016	This probably reflects a lower abundance of fatty acids with 14 or more carbons, which become the dominant mitochondrial substrates in progressors whose mitochondrial shuttling of fatty acids with 16 or more carbons is impaired because of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) inhibition (50).
PMC6948762	D04001	G proteins promote transcriptional activation of metabolic genes by carbohydrate-response element-binding protein and regulate downstream lipogenic genes, including ACACA, fatty acid synthetase, acyl CoA synthase, and glycerol phosphate acyl transferase (51).
PMC6948762	D04002	In particular, the significant association of ACACA gene expression with DAGs in the glomerular and TAGs in the tubulointerstitial compartments supports the hypothesis that the observed differential serum lipids may be regulated, in part, by renal acetyl-CoA carboxylase.
PMC6948762	D04003	The direct correlation of shorter low-double-bond DAGs with elongase and desaturase imply that a higher abundance of such lipids may upregulate the renal cortical elongation and desaturation of fatty acids as a compensatory mechanism that converts shorter and relatively more saturated, toxic lipids into longer, relatively more unsaturated, less toxic products.
PMC6948762	D05001	De novo lipogenesis of long chain fatty acids is dependent on the activity of 3 cytosolic enzymes: ATP citrate lyase, ACC, and fatty acid synthetase (53).
PMC6948762	D05005	acetyl-CoA carboxylase activation inhibits CPT1, lowering cytosolic conversion of long chain acyl CoA to long chain AC, decreases substrate for the carnitine shuttle, impairs β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids, and increases cytosolic abundance of palmitate (53).
PMC6948762	D05006	Increased palmitate promotes elongation and desaturation, as evidenced by upregulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) 1 and 2 (Figure 9 and ref. 56).
PMC6948762	D06004	In addition, acetyl-CoA carboxylase upregulation can inhibit CPT1, which impairs β-oxidation.
PMC6948762	D08001	Although existing knowledge of the de novo lipogenesis pathway, along with the results obtained from the transcriptomic-lipidomic integrative analysis, support the hypothesis that ACC activation may be responsible, in part, for the differential lipid pattern, our results cannot distinguish whether the increased renal acetyl-CoA carboxylase expression is a cause or a consequence of the differential plasma lipid profile.
PMC6948762	D09006	The underlying mechanism may depend on impairment of fatty acid β-oxidation and renal acetyl-CoA carboxylase activation, thus providing a potential therapeutic target (Figure 9).

PMC7001531	D01003	As shown in the arginine metabolic pathway (Figure 7A), arginine is the precursor of nitric oxide (NO), and NO is synthesized from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which includes neuronal NOS (nNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).
PMC7001531	D01008	Arginase (also present in the brain) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of arginine to ornithine, competing with eNOS (in the choroid plexus and vascular endothelium) for arginine (28).
PMC7001531	D01010	The increase of arginase activity will decrease the catalytic activity of arginine for NO production and lead to the uncoupling of eNOS, while uncoupled eNOS can induce the transfer of electrons from NADPH to oxygen molecules to form superoxide anions (O2-).
PMC7001531	D01011	In vitro studies also found that a high concentration of arginine decreased the antioxidant capacity of brain tissue, which in turn increased oxidative stress, inhibited the activity of glutathione peroxidase in the brain tissue, induced the production of neurotoxic substances, and finally decreased the recovery of nerve function (15, 28).

PMC7017805	A00000	Dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway has been regarded as a mechanism of tumor immune escape by the enzymatic activity of indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase and kynurenine production.
PMC7017805	A00002	In this study, plasma from patients diagnosed with metastatic cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) was obtained before (PRE) and during treatment (TRM) with inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPKIs).
PMC7017805	D00006	Also, the complex interplay of the activity of the KP component may imply the existence of a feedback mechanism; e.g., kynurenine 3-monooxygenase activity is one determinant of KYNA production by regulating the amount of KYN substrate available to KATs (60).
PMC7017805	D03001	3-HK and KYNA interactions in the PRE network identify groups of proteins such as CXCL13, IL-8, TIE2, ADGRG1, CCL20, and CXCL9 to be involved in Tie2 and SHP2 signaling with an inhibitory effect on Th1 differentiation (51–54) Interaction of Tie2, a tyrosine kinase receptor, with its ligand angiopoietin-1(Ang1), regulates angiogenesis which makes it an attractive target for cancer therapy (53).
PMC7017805	D03004	The tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11), also known as SHP-2, is a critical intracellular regulator that mediates cell proliferation and differentiation (63).
PMC7017805	D08001	However, it is previously reported that lower level of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, 3-HK, and 3HAA is associated with less proliferative and exhausted CD4+ T-cells (67).
PMC7017805	D09001	IFN-γ and TNF-α also induce kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, KYNU expression as well as 3-HK production (71, 72).
PMC7017805	D09002	Therefore, we speculated that inhibition of MAPK pathway with MAPKIs impair the balance between mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways with KP activity and therefore activates compensatory feedback loops to elevate KP activation toward 3-HK and 3-HAA production.

PMC7017805	I01002	More recently, preliminary results in patients with metastatic melanoma indicate that combining indolamine 2, 3-dioxygenase 1 inhibitors (IDO1i) with either CTLA-4 inhibitor or PD-1 inhibitor (PD-1i) increases the effectiveness of these immunotherapies in CMM patients (7–9).

PMC3374609	F51002	Bacterial flavodoxins support nitric oxide production by Bacillus subtilis nitric-oxide synthase.
PMC3374609	R04001	These unsurprisingly included large, well-conserved pathways such as the ribosome (M00178) and polymerase (M00183), but also a variety of smaller specialized modules such as sugar transport (M00207, four genes, present in staggered/high-complexity at 0.25% and detected at 0.28%) and biotin biosynthesis (M00123, four genes, present at 1.7% and detected at 1.7%).
PMC3374609	R06003	Two of these extended the categories listed above; the remainder comprised sn-Glycerol 3-phosphate transport (M00198, a membrane lipid precursor [32]), the mannose and trehalose phosphotransferase systems (M00270 and M00276), spermidine/putrescine transport (M00299), early terpenoid biosynthesis (M00364), and threonine biosynthesis (M00018), the only amino acid module to meet this prevalence threshold.
PMC3374609	R10001	Chondroitin and dermatan sulfate degradation share the greatest overlap with 3 KO families, including beta-glucuronidase (K01195).
PMC3374609	R10002	Beta-glucuronidase is prevalent in the gut, averaging 0.03% sd.
PMC3374609	R10010	This is due exclusively to the absence of the module's input enzyme, heparanase (K07964-5), a typically eukaryotic gene family implicated in tumor metastasis [47]; the healthy commensal microbiota may thus lack this activity in order to avoid undesirable inflammatory and immune response in the gut [48].
PMC3374609	R10011	Conversely, the abundances of the four gut-specific GAG degration modules were not driven by one specific gene family (Figure 5), ranging from the most abundant beta-hexosaminidase (K12373, ave.
PMC3374609	R10012	0.3% sd. 0.1%) to the low-abundance outlier L-iduronidase (K01217, ave.
PMC3374609	R11001	Enriched functions included phosphate, glutamate/aspartate, and phosphotransferase transport systems (M00222, M00230, M00276, M00277, M00287); other functions such as arginine and amino acid transport (M00229, M00237) were significantly depleted.
PMC3374609	R11005	The low number of genes involved would render its detection prone to noise; however, as described below, this module is detected very consistently only in women with vaginal pH≥4.0, and then only due to either K00536 (Enzyme Class EC 1.19.6.1, nitrogenase - flavodoxin) or, in a minority of cases, K02588 (EC 1.18.6.1, nitrogenase).
PMC3374609	R12009	Specifically, pH correlated with the abundances of N-acetylgalactosamine II phosphotransferase (M00277), proline biosynthesis (M00015), and again “nitrogen fixation” (M00175), while phosphate transport (M00222), peptide/nickel transport (M00239), and lysine biosynthesis (M00016) were associated with lower pH. Species within the Lactobacilli are known to specialize in exactly these areas of nutrient uptake and carbohydrate metabolism [55], [56], and many of these differences can be observed directly within finished genomes (e.g. lysine biosynthesis is present in L. crispatus and lacking in L. gasseri[26]).
PMC3374609	R15003	Those pathways that were consistently present tended to be so broadly defined (e.g. ko02060, phosphotransferases, or ko00030, the entirety of pentose phosphate) that they provided too coarse a view with which to observe metabolic variation and niche specialization among body sites.
PMC3374609	R16005	Likewise, pyruvate metabolism includes portions of the citric acid cycle (M00173), absent from the posterior fornix and rare in the gut and skin; pyruvate oxidation (M00307), absent from the posterior fornix and rare in the gut; and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (M00310), present only in the nares and gut.
PMC3374609	R17006	In particular, six CAZy-module pairs had significant positive or negative correlations in all seven body sites: proline biosynthesis with GH5 (cellulase) and GH18 (chitinase); 2-oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase with GH28 (galacturonases) and GH97 (α-glucosidase and α-galactosidase); and glutathione transport with GH3 (β-glucosidase) and GH18.
PMC3374615	I01000	CRISPR arrays are usually adjacent to cas genes, which encode a large and heterogeneous family of proteins with functional domains typical of nucleases, helicases, polymerases, and polynucleotide-binding proteins.

PMC3386201	D01000	Activities of both enzymes were directly associated with higher abundance of five Clostridia genera in the phylum Firmicutes, especially with Ruminococcaceae, Subdoligranulum and non-Clostridiales, largely complementing and corroborating in vitro results, such as the previously noted high prevalence of the classical gus gene and β-glucuronidase activity among Ruminococcaceae isolates.
PMC3386201	D01002	[7], [11] We found that activity levels of both enzymes had significant inverse associations with the relative abundance of Roseburia, whereas Dabek and colleagues noted that all eight Roseburia strains examined produced β-glucosidase and six of these also produced β-glucuronidase.
PMC3386201	D01003	[11] Moreover, Gloux et al found one Roseburia strain that harbored a newly discovered class of genes with β-glucuronidase (BG) activity.
PMC3386201	D01005	Enzyme activities in our study also were directly associated with the abundance of Alistipes in the phylum Bacteroidetes, which did not harbor the newly discovered BG genes, but which also has not been evaluated for in vitro production of β-glucuronidase or β-glucosidase.
PMC3386201	D01007	Further annotation, functional and metatranscriptomic approaches are clearly needed to discern whether the enzymatic levels detected in vivo correspond to a few highly active and readily inducible genes, or to more modest expression by multiple glycosidase genes acting in concert.

PMC3409016	R09002	For example, in both metagenomes enzymes of three pathways involved in sulfur oxidation were detected: the Adenosine-5’-Phosphosulfate (EC 2.7.7.4, EC 1.8.99.2), the Sulfite:Cytochrome C oxidoreductase (EC 1.8.2.1) and the Sox enzyme complex (Figure ​(Figure2).2).
PMC3409016	R11001	We identified key genes for nitrification, denitrification, nitrogen fixation and nitrate ammonification, including ammonia monooxygenase (amoA), nitrate reductase (narGnapAnasA), nitrite reductase (nirKnirS), nitric oxide reductase (nor), nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), nitrogenase (nifHnifD) and assimilatory nitrite reductase (nrfAnirAnirB) in both metagenomes (Figure ​(Figure3).3).
PMC3409016	R11006	Respiratory nitrate reductase (narG) reduces nitrate to nitrite predominantly during anaerobic growth, while the nasA assimilate nitrate during aerobic growth [53].
PMC3409016	R11012	In fact, the gene encoding for ammonia monooxygenase (amoA), a key enzyme for ammonia oxidation was highly enriched in the BP metagenome (Fisher’s exact test, q < 0.05) (Table ​(Table2).2).
PMC3409016	R12003	For example, the stand-alone arsB chemiosmotic transport protein (i.e. anion channel) is enriched in the TP biofilm (Fisher’s exact test, q < 0.05), while the BP biofilm is rich in arsA enzymes (EC 3.6.3.16) (Fisher’s exact test, q < 0.05), which transform the arsB into an arsAB ATPase complex [59].

PMC3409016	R14005	In this study we were able to detect the presence of putative membrane-associated ammonia monooxygenase in the BP biofilm.
PMC3409016	R14009	Thus, the lack of previous detection of amoA genes by Santo Domingo et al.[11] can be explained by the fact that the assay cannot detect the amoA in heterotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria as they were designed to amplify representatives of the autotrophic ammonia monooxygenase, for example, Nitrosomonas species [68].
PMC3409016	R15001	The reconstruction of the sulfur metabolism network showed several pathways used to oxidize the end products of sulfate reduction leading to the production of H2SO4, e.g. Sox complex, sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (sqr) and the flavocytochrome c (fccAB) in the corroded section of the pipe (Figure ​(Figure2).2).

PMC3798377	A00000	Intestinal proteases carry out a variety of functions in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
PMC3798377	A00001	Studies have reported that elevated enteric proteases in patients with GI disease can alter intestinal physiology, however the origin (human vs. microbial) of elevated proteases in patients with GI disease is unclear.
PMC3798377	A02000	In order to capture a wide range of fecal protease (fecal protease) activity stool samples were collected from 30 IBS patients and 24 healthy controls.
PMC3798377	A02003	fecal protease activity levels were determined using an ELISA-based method.
PMC3798377	A02004	fecal protease activity was ranked and top and bottom quartiles (n=13 per quartile) were identified as having high and low fecal protease activity, respectively.
PMC3798377	A03000	The overall diversity of the intestinal microbiota displayed significant clustering separation (p = 0.001) between samples with high vs. low fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	A03001	The Lactobacillales, Lachnospiraceae, and Streptococcaceae groups were positively associated with fecal protease activity across the entire study population, whilst the Ruminococcaceae family and an unclassified Coriobacteriales family were negatively associated with fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D00000	Although it has been known for some time that the intestinal microbiota is a significant source of protease activity in the GI tract, to date there has only been one report that correlated specific enteric bacterial taxa with fecal protease activity in the human gut [26].
PMC3798377	D00004	Our study used molecular methods to identify the enteric bacterial taxa that are associated with fecal protease activity, thus adding to the knowledge of human protease activity in the human GI tract.
PMC3798377	D01000	We found a significant difference in the overall composition of the microbiota between fecal samples with high versus low fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D01003	A significant difference between the microbiotas of high versus low fecal protease activity samples using both un-weighted and weighted analyses suggests that the difference in microbial communities between these groups is based on both dominant and low abundance bacterial taxa present in fecal samples.
PMC3798377	D01004	This finding is supported by the estimation of α-diversity measures (rarefaction) between fecal samples with high versus low fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D01005	We found that the number of observed bacterial species (based on species-level OTUs) and Shannon index of diversity were significantly lower in fecal samples with high fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D01008	Together, these findings indicate that individuals with high fecal protease activity have lower numbers and diversity of bacterial species in their intestine and harbor a microbiota that is distinct from individuals with low fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D02000	When we applied a stringent association analysis and adjusted for confounding demographic data across our entire study population between fecal protease activity and specific bacterial taxa, we found the Lactobacillales, Lachnospiraceae, and Streptococcaceae groups and an unclassified Coriobacteriales family were positively associated with fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D02002	The Streptococcaceae family is likely the driving force behind the association between the Lactobacillales order and fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D02005	Interestingly, members of the Streptococcus genus have been found to produce proteases with a broad range of functions [28-33].
PMC3798377	D04000	We also found that the Ruminococcaceae family was negatively correlated with fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D04003	Indeed, our qPCR analysis confirmed an association between F. prausnitzii and fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D04006	Additionally, we found that an unclassified Coriobacteriales family was associated with fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D04007	Given the lack of information regarding this group of bacteria, we cannot speculate on the relevance of its relationship to fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D04008	As the Ruminococcaceae family encompasses beneficial bacterial species and the Streptococcaceae family encompasses protease producers, it is tempting to speculate that a microbiota associated with low fecal protease activity is associated with a more beneficial to the host than a microbiota with high fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D05000	Unlike previous studies that observed a significant increase in fecal protease activity in IBS patients compared to healthy controls [6,10], we did not find a substantial difference in fecal protease activity between these groups in the current study.
PMC3798377	D06000	In conclusion, we report a distinction between the microbiotas within fecal samples with high and low fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D06001	The distinction between these microbiotas is likely due to the presence of low microbial diversity and the absence of bacterial taxa in fecal samples with high fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D06003	One of the strengths of our study includes the diverse source of fecal samples (i.e., from HC and certain types of IBS patients) that enable the analysis of human specimens with a broad range of fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D06007	Furthermore, the relative contribution of the altered microbiota in individuals with elevated fecal protease activity could be responsible for the alterations in GI physiology and the pathogenesis of certain GI diseases e.g., IBS and IBD
PMC3798377	D06009	Our study findings provide a basis for further research, including metagenomic sequencing, to investigate the role of the bacterial groups identified in our study, and the proteases they produce, with the pathogenesis of GI diseases.

PMC3798377	I00000	Proteases, or proteolytic enzymes, catalyze the breakdown of proteins by hydrolysis of peptide bonds.
PMC3798377	I00001	Compared to all other organs in the human body, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract contains the highest levels of endogenous and exogenous proteases [1].
PMC3798377	I00002	Initially the function of proteases was considered to be the breakdown of protein relevant to food digestion and intracellular protein turnover; however it was discovered that precise cleavage of proteins by proteases leads to a very subtle means of regulation [2].
PMC3798377	I00003	It is now known that proteases are involved in diverse processes such as cell-cycle progression, cell proliferation and cell death, DNA replication, tissue remodeling, coagulation, wound healing and the immune response [3].
PMC3798377	I00004	Indeed, proteolytic activity is tightly regulated to prevent any destructive activity of proteases.
PMC3798377	I01000	Protease-related genes make up approximately 2% of the mammalian genome and host proteases significantly contribute to the enzymatic content of the GI tract.
PMC3798377	I01001	However, the enteric microbiota is also a substantial source of serine, cysteine, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the intestine [4-6].
PMC3798377	R00001	These samples demonstrated a wide range of fecal protease activity (Figure 1).
PMC3798377	R00002	fecal protease activity was ranked from low to high (0-450 U Trypsin/mg protein) and divided into quartiles.
PMC3798377	R00003	The top and bottom quartiles were used to separate and further investigate samples with high (n = 13) and low (n = 13) fecal protease activity (Figure 1).
PMC3798377	R00004	The fecal protease activity data displayed a strong degree of non-normality.
PMC3798377	R00006	Accordingly, we applied a normal quantile transformation to fecal protease measurements to normalize these data.
PMC3798377	R02000	Comparison of the composition of the microbiotas between samples with high and low fecal protease activity was first carried out using a bipartite.
PMC3798377	R02001	In Figure 2 high and low fecal protease activity samples are represented by one node type and bacterial OTUs are designated as a second node type.
PMC3798377	R02002	High and low fecal protease activity nodes are connected to OTU nodes via ‘edges’.
PMC3798377	R02003	This OTU network displays a clear separation between high and low fecal protease activity samples.
PMC3798377	R02004	In the second approach Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) of UniFrac distances revealed a significant separation of the microbiotas between samples with high and low fecal protease activity based on un-weighted (p=0.001, R=0.22) and weighted (p=0.003, R=0.14) distances (Figure 3).
PMC3798377	R03000	Bacterial richness was assessed by rarefaction of OTUs found in high and low fecal protease activity samples.
PMC3798377	R03001	A significant decrease in the number of observed OTUs and the Shannon index of diversity was found in samples with high compared to low fecal protease activity (p < 0.002) (Figure 4).
PMC3798377	R04000	Family level taxa were found to display compositional differences between samples with high and low fecal protease activity (Figure 5).
PMC3798377	R04001	Correlation of bacterial groups with transformed fecal protease activity levels across the entire study population identified significant associations with specific bacterial taxa at the Family level at an FDR level of 0.1 (Table 1).
PMC3798377	R04002	The Lactobacillales, Lachnospiraceae, and Streptococcaceae groups were positively associated with fecal protease activity across the entire study population, whilst the Ruminococcaceae family and an unclassified Coriobacteriales family were negatively associated with fecal protease activity (Table 1).
PMC3798377	R05003	We found a significant (p=0.01) negative correlation of F. prausnitzii with fecal protease activity (Figure 6).
PMC3798377	R05004	Association of fecal protease activity with baseline demographic data (age, race, BMI, and IBS status) revealed no confounding individual predictors (p=0.67).

PMC3810253	R00002	A truncated form of recombinant Protein A was covalently coupled to a paramagnetic bead and was used to bind the MBD-Fc protein.
PMC3810253	R01003	We first prebound the MBD-Fc protein with paramagnetic Protein A beads, then incubated increasing amounts of MBD-Fc bound Protein A with 500 ng of input DNA, and separated bead-bound from unbound DNA fractions using a magnetic field as outlined in Figure 1.
PMC3810253	R03000	To determine the CpG methylation density required for effective binding of DNA by the MBD-Fc-protein A complex, T7 (39.9 kb) and lambda phage (48.5 kb) DNAs were cleaved with BstEII and XbaI restriction enzymes, respectively.
PMC3810253	R03002	The T7 and lambda DNA fragments were then methylated with M.HhaI (GmCGC), M.Hpa II (CmCGG) or both methyltransferases.
PMC3810253	R03004	From each pool, 250 ng of DNA was added to 40 µL of MBD-Fc-protein A beads, and the supernatant containing the unbound DNA was quantified using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel densitometry.
PMC3811629	F30002	Polymerase chain reaction primers miss half of rRNA microbial diversity.
PMC3812899	I02006	However, this study yielded limited information because the faecal samples were only analysed for changes in eight metabolites, including increased levels of amino acids and urea caused by the loss of microbial proteases and ureases, and reduced levels of acetate, butyrate and propionate generated by lactate-using bacteria.
PMC3812899	R05002	These genes were functionally categorised to have roles in protein transport and binding (potassium uptake protein, TonB-dependent receptor, nitrile hydratase propeptide microcin bacteriocin system ATP-binding cassette transporter, peptidase/ATP-binding protein), toxin production and resistance (resistance-nodulation-cell division superfamily and hydrophobe/amphiphile efflux-1 transporters), detoxification (heavy metal efflux and CzcA permeases), mobile and extrachromosomal elements (phage lambda tail tape measure protein) and protein fate determination (TolC type I secretion outer membrane protein).
PMC3812899	R10002	AB-treated samples were also characterised by a striking depletion of the translation elongation factors required for protein synthesis, such as GTPases, which facilitate the release of nascent polypeptide chains; this depletion was accentuated after treatment cessation (figure 7B).
PMC3812899	R10004	Additional key proteins, such as aerobic CobN cobaltochelatases (COG1429) essential for the biosynthesis of vitamin B12, were also found to be depleted (see table 3 in the online supplement) in samples FS-3, FS-11 and FS-14 compared with untreated samples.

PMC3827270	A00007	We functionally confirmed three novel resistance genes, including a 16S rRNA methylase conferring aminoglycoside resistance, and two tetracycline-resistance proteins nearly identical to a bifidobacterial MFS transporter (B. longum s. longum JDM301).
PMC3827270	A00008	We provide the first report to our knowledge of resistance to folate-synthesis inhibitors conferred by a predicted Nudix hydrolase (part of the folate synthesis pathway).
PMC3827270	D00005	Chloramphenicol acetyltransferases were commonly found in this cohort, as were multiple-antibiotic-resistance transcriptional regulators (MarA and its homologs SoxS and Rob).
PMC3827270	D00006	All major classes of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes were detected, as well as rRNA methyltransferases.
PMC3827270	D00007	Presumed drug-resistant dihydrofolate reductases and D-ala-D-ala ligases were present in every metagenomic library.
PMC3827270	D04000	Finally, we report trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance conferred by a contig encoding a putative Nudix hydrolase, which depyrophosphorylates dihydroneopterin triphosphate in the pterin branch of the folate synthesis pathway [39].
PMC3827270	D04001	The precise resistance mechanism is unclear: Nudix hydrolase acts far upstream of dihydrofolate reductase or dihydropteroate synthase, the respective targets of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole that have previously described drug-resistant variants [47].

PMC3827270	R03001	Class A contained clusters of beta-lactamases similar to cephalosporinases previously identified in human fecal microbiota [5], and 12 unique proteins with <55% identity to any known beta-lactamase.
PMC3827270	R03002	A diverse set of predicted class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), including members of the TEM, SHV, CTX-M, and VEB protein families, were identified.
PMC3827270	R03004	A fifth group of beta-lactamases, CLOBOL, was comprised of proteins with high amino acid identity to the putative beta-lactamase CLOBOL_04087 from Clostridium boltae ATCC BAA-613 (GenBank Accession NZ_ABCC02000033.1).
PMC3827270	R04000	We found both pathogen-identical and novel putative beta-lactamase genes syntenic with mobile elements; these genes were often found in multiple genetic contexts, highlighting the dissemination of these genes within the gut microbiota of healthy children and adolescents.

PMC3827270	R05000	Diverse predicted aminoglycoside acetyltransferases, phosphotransferases (Fig. 3), and adenylyltransferases were identified, as were several rRNA methylases (Table S6 in File S1), which presumably confer resistance via target protection.
PMC3827270	R05001	[26] A novel transposase-associated aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (F33GE_12) was only 52% identical to any known phosphotransferase, and nucleotide BLAST of the source contig against the NCBI nt and wgs databases revealed only low identity to several Firmicutes over one-third of the contig length, suggesting a cryptic source organism for this mobilizable resistance gene at risk for dissemination.
PMC3827270	R05003	The aminoglycoside-2″ phosphotransferase Ib encoded on this C. difficile-identical sequence was 99% identical to one identified in Enterococcus faecium (GenBank Accession 3HAM_A)
PMC3827270	R06000	We also characterized a novel 16S rRNA methylase with only 42% amino acid identity to an rRNA methylase from Enterobacter cloacae strain 115–824A (GenBank Accession JN968578).
PMC3827270	R06001	This rRNA methylase generates extreme resistance to gentamicin and amikacin, with clonal growth observed at 1024 ug/mL and 2048 ug/mL respectively (Table 2); clones remained susceptible to the closely related aminocyclitol spectinomycin (MIC 32 ug/mL for both clones and controls).
PMC3827270	R10000	In tigecycline selections, only sequences encoding flavin-dependent monooxygenases (TetX1 and TetX2) were found (Table S9 in File S1) on contigs homologous with the ermF region of the tetracycline-inducible Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron CTnDOT conjugative transposon (GenBank Accession AJ311171)

PMC3827270	R12000	Contigs bearing genes that encoded D-ala-D-ala ligase were found to confer cycloserine resistance in all metagenomic libraries, possibly secondary to overexpression of plasmid-borne D-ala-D-ala ligase or D-alanine racemase by the E. coli host [36].
PMC3827270	R12001	Notably, a contig (F30CY_50) bearing a D-ala-D-ala ligase, syntenic with a RecR recombination protein and a penicillin binding protein homologous to the penicillin-insensitive PBP2b, had a nearly identical (98%) protein sequence to several group D streptococcus (Streptococcus bovis) strains (Table S12 in File S1).
PMC3827270	R12002	Other contigs with D-ala-D-ala ligases syntenic with mobilization elements (F16CY_74, F18CY_75) had identity to uncultured organisms over <70% of the total fragment length (Table S1 in File S1).
PMC3827270	R13000	Genes encoding drug-resistant dihydrofolate reductase A were present in all libraries, and were frequently associated with thymidylate synthase and occasionally with aminoglycoside adenylyltransferases, MATE efflux proteins, and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin ABC transporters (Tables S10, S11 in File S1).
PMC3827270	R13001	Some contigs encoding dihydrofolate reductase and a mobilization element had high nucleotide identity to known commensals (e.g. F24TRSX_31, with >98% identity to Streptococcus salivarius (GenBank Accession CP002888.1))
PMC3827270	R14000	We also identified a putative novel mechanism of antibiotic resistance: a contig encoding a Nudix hydrolase identical to one reported in Lachnospiraceae bacterium 7_1_58FAA (GenBank accession NZ_ACTW01000031) was found to confer resistance to both trimethoprim (MIC 512 ug/mL trimethoprim; control MIC 32 ug/mL) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (MIC 32/608 ug/mL trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole; control MIC 2/32 ug/mL) in the E. coli host.

PMC3967525	R08002	Two of the most highly expressed genes in the CF transcriptome (excluding those for translation or RNA processing) were NADH oxidoreductase (K03882) and the alpha-subunit of the F-type ATPase (K02126).
PMC3967525	R09004	In our data, most reads corresponding to fermentation pathways mapped to Streptococcus spp., except for butanediol dehydrogenase, which also mapped to Rothia spp.
PMC3967525	R10006	More specifically, dihydrolipoamide (the reduced form of lipoic acid) is a cofactor of pyruvate dehydrogenase, a central enzyme for the assimilation of pyruvate into anabolic pathways or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
PMC3967525	R12005	Our CF data are consistent with microbes sensing the varying availability of oxygen: the metagenomes contained anaerobic respiration response regulators (Gram-positive resED and Gram-negative arcAB), the nreBC low-oxygen sensor, and cytochrome c oxidase.
PMC3967525	R13002	Nitrate reductase was the most abundant electron acceptor gene in the metagenome and transcriptome, consistent with P. aeruginosa’s proposed ability for denitrification in the lung (21, 55).
PMC3967525	R14000	The origins of oxidized compounds that could serve as the substrates for these reductases are unknown.
PMC3967525	R14003	Fumarate is a central compound in many metabolic pathways, most notably the TCA cycle and amino acid breakdown, and is generated by succinate dehydrogenase, which was abundant in CF metagenomes and metatranscriptomes (Table S1).
PMC3967525	R15000	The terminal reductase cytochrome c oxidase was also present and expressed in the CF sputa, indicating that the CF microbes are utilizing O2 as a terminal electron acceptor (Fig. 3).
PMC3967525	R15001	Interestingly, there was a high abundance of the cbb-type cytochrome c oxidase; this enzyme is known to have a higher affinity for O2 and is preferentially used by P. aeruginosa in low oxygen (67, 68), which would be useful for aerobically respiring microbes living in the microaerobic conditions of mucus.
PMC3967525	R15002	Accordingly, cbb-type cytochrome c oxidase reads were assigned almost entirely to Pseudomonas spp., indicating that this may be a vitally important enzyme to the physiology of P. aeruginosa within the CF lung.
PMC3967525	R17002	Nitrate and ammonia have been shown to be elevated in CF lung fluids compared to non-CF controls (21, 23, 54), whereas nitric oxide and expression of human nitric oxide synthase are decreased compared to other inflammatory airway diseases (23, 71, 72).

PMC3967525	R25005	The CF lung has also been found to be elevated in copper (79), and accordingly, the sensor histidine kinase that responds to copper, cusSR, was also present and expressed (no ABC transporter for copper is available in the KEGG database) (Table S6).

PMC4139721	D07004	In the present study, genes encoding lysine decarboxylase, L-alanine dehydrogenase, biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase PLP-binding and argininosuccinate lyase exhibited a higher abundance in periodontitis that might lead to the increasing of many amino acid metabolites in periodontal patients (Barnes et al., 2009, 2011).
PMC4139721	D08005	Of particular interest to us is the gene encoding N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-4-sulfate 4-sulfohydrolase associated with C-4-S degradation because the gingival crevicular fluid content of C-4-S exhibited significant correlations with probing depth and attachment loss (Last et al., 1985; Smith et al., 1995) and C-4-S is regarded as a biomarker for bone degradation as it accounts for 94% of GAGs in alveolar bone (Waddington et al., 1989; Armitage, 2004).

PMC4139721	R10001	Of these, four genes exhibited higher relative abundances in periodontitis, including those encoding lysine decarboxylase, L-alanine dehydrogenase, biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase PLP-binding and argininosuccinate lyase, that play an indispensable role in lysine, alanine and arginine metabolism.

PMC4177395	R04007	Furthermore, all of the single copy marker genes used to assess genome completeness could be identified along with all 20 aminoacyl tRNA synthetase genes in the V. cambriense genome (Additional file 3).
PMC4177395	R09000	Several genomes encode cytochrome bd oxidase (Table 3 and Figure 2), a high oxygen affinity enzyme indicative of an ability to grow in the presence of low levels of oxygen, either by providing protection from reactive oxygen species or by using oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor during respiration [61,62].
PMC4177395	R09001	The presence of fumarate, TMAO, DMSO, nitrate, nitrite, and nitric oxide reductase genes supports the notion that members of the community are capable of using several terminal electron acceptors to respire anaerobically (Table 3, Figure 2, and Additional file 2: Figure S4).
PMC4177395	R09002	E. coli was the only organism found to encode heme-copper cytochrome oxidase genes, indicating its ability to use oxygen as an electron acceptor when present.

PMC4177395	R25000	Identification of fumarate reductase (EC: 1.3.99.1), nitrate reductase (EC: 1.7.99.4), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase (EC: 1.8.5.3), suggests that fumarate, nitrate, and DMSO can all be used as terminal electron acceptors.

PMC4510187	A00002	We hypothesized that bacterial glycoside hydrolase (glycoside hydrolase) activities would be higher in a biofilm than in saliva in order to maintain metabolism in a low-sugar, high-glycoprotein environment.
PMC4510187	A00006	Overall higher glycoside hydrolase activities were observed in plaque samples, in agreement with in vitro observation.
PMC4510187	A00007	A similar pattern was observed in glycoside hydrolase activity profiles between in vitro and ex vivo data.
PMC4510187	A00008	16S rRNA gene analysis showed that plaque samples had a higher abundance of microorganisms with larger number of glycoside hydrolase gene sequences.
PMC4510187	D00000	Our results supported the first hypothesis, that higher activities of glycoside hydrolase were observed in biofilm grown in mucin medium, where the only carbon source available was complex carbohydrate.
PMC4510187	D00001	This is in agreement with previous reports in which single-species streptococci showed upregulation of the glycoside hydrolase when fermented in the absence of simple carbon sources (4, 5).
PMC4510187	D00002	The activities of four out of six enzymes peaked at 48 h, in agreement with a previous study where glycoside hydrolase of S. gordonii culture were downregulated during exponential growth phase compared to the stationary phase (4).
PMC4510187	D01000	The results agreed with the second hypothesis, in which overall higher activities of glycoside hydrolase occurred in biofilm samples than in saliva samples.
PMC4510187	D02000	Bacteria with the largest numbers of glycoside hydrolase genes are found to be most prevalent in dental plaque, and this appears to correlate with higher glycoside hydrolase activity.
PMC4510187	D02001	Among the microorganisms measured, S. gordonii and P. gingivalis harbor the largest number of glycoside hydrolase coding sequences as well as the most types of glycoside hydrolase enzymes.
PMC4510187	D02002	These organisms, along with P. intermedia and T. denticola, have genes for β-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase (GH20) and α-fucosidase (GH29).
PMC4510187	D02003	On the other hand, the most abundant GHs in S. salivarius, which accounted for the majority of salivary species, are α-amylase, lysozyme, and sucrase (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).
PMC4510187	D02004	Our results cannot determine what percentage of the cell-bound glycoside hydrolase activities in saliva was derived from bacteria; however, the enzymes in host cells are expressed at low levels and are associated primarily with intracellular metabolism, and hence they are not excreted to a significant extent.
PMC4510187	D03001	Our results are in line with previous reports in that (i) all six GHs were present in saliva of healthy adults (16, 17) and (ii) β-d-galactosidase activity was absent in salivary supernatant, while activities of β-d-hexosaminidase and sialidase were present (18).
PMC4510187	D03002	The cell-bound form of glucosaminidase activities was consistently the highest among the measured glycoside hydrolase in our samples, both in vitro and ex vivo.
PMC4510187	D03003	β-N-Ac-glucosaminidase and glucosidase have been reported as the predominant GHs in healthy human dental plaque (13).
PMC4510187	D03004	The presence of both cell-bound and secreted forms of sialidase is also in agreement with previous reports (19, 20).
PMC4510187	D04000	Both fucosidase and sialidase were present in the secreted form in saliva.
PMC4510187	D04001	Although the secreted form of sialidase has been reported, this is the first report on secreted fucosidase to the best of our knowledge.
PMC4510187	D04002	The presence of secreted forms of glycoside hydrolase, especially fucosidase and sialidase, can be explained by the modification of terminal glycoside moiety to provide a better scaffold for bacterial adhesion (21, 22).
PMC4510187	D04003	The complete lack of secreted glucosidase and galactosidase activities in saliva suggests that alternative hexose sugar production in response to external glycosides is not significantly induced.
PMC4510187	D04004	Our in vitro experiment showed the onset of glucosidase activity in mucin medium occurred at a later time point than that of the other 5 glycoside hydrolase activities.
PMC4510187	D04006	However, since the trigger for production of glycoside hydrolase is the energy requirements of the bacteria producing the enzyme, a more global benefit to the biofilm may be an example of kin discrimination (23).
PMC4510187	D04008	It is noteworthy that the secreted form of glucosidase was detected in biofilm grown in nutrient-rich sucrose medium at an earlier time point than that grown in mucin medium in our in vitro experiment.

PMC4510187	I00006	These CAZymes include glycosyltransferases and glycoside hydrolases (GHs).
PMC4510187	I00008	We speculated that the breakdown of complex, endogenous carbohydrates by glycoside hydrolase enzymes is one mechanism whereby oral microbes adapt to different carbon sources between the salivary planktonic phase, where exogenous simple sugars are generally more available, and the oral biofilm phase, where, in the absence of exogenous simple sugars, several alternative, more complex endogenous salivary glycoconjugates are the principal carbon source (8,–11).
PMC4510187	I01000	Our hypotheses for the present study were that (i) glycoside hydrolase activities are higher under conditions where the primary carbon sources are limited to complex glycan conjugates and (ii) levels of glycoside hydrolase enzymes are higher in dental plaque than in saliva due to the shift in microbial population between saliva and plaque.
PMC4510187	I02000	Here we report the glycoside hydrolase levels under conditions where carbon source availabilities include simple sugars (saliva) and those where they are limited to complex glycoconjugates (dental plaque).
PMC4510187	I02001	Our first experiment was to test if carbohydrate availability influences glycoside hydrolase activities in in vitro oral biofilm, followed by ex vivo experiments in which glycoside hydrolase activities were measured in saliva and overnight dental plaque.
PMC4510187	R00000	Overall, higher glycoside hydrolase activities were found in spent mucin medium supernatant, except for glucosidase at the 24- and 48-h time points and fucosidase at the 24-h time point (Fig. 1 and Table 1 ).
PMC4510187	R00001	These two enzymes showed continuous increases in their activities for 72 h, whereas the other four glycoside hydrolase activities peaked at 48 h. At 72 h, fucosidase, sialidase, and glucosaminidase were found to have higher activities in supernatant than in the cell-bound form (Table 1).
PMC4510187	R00002	Glucosaminidase activity was found to be the highest for both secreted and cell-bound forms among the 6 measured glycoside hydrolase, followed by galactosaminidase activity.
PMC4510187	R01005	Both cellular suspension and cell-free supernatant were assayed for glycoside hydrolase activities (Fig. 2).
PMC4510187	R02001	Secreted fucosidase, hexosaminidase, and sialidase were found in supernatant, while no activity was detected for galactosidase or glucosidase in supernatant.
PMC4510187	R02002	Secreted fucosidase activity level was equivalent with that of cell-bound form.
PMC4510187	R03005	Both cellular suspension and cell-free supernatant were assayed for glycosidase activities (Fig. 3).
PMC4510187	R04002	The ratios of the fucosidase activity of the secreted form to the cell-bound form were lower in overnight plaque than in saliva.
PMC4510187	R04003	In contrast to saliva samples, the secreted forms were observed for galactosidase and glucosidase in overnight plaque.
PMC4510187	R04004	Indeed, the highest activity observed in the secreted form was that of glucosidase, which was more than a third of the activity of its cell-bound counterpart.
PMC4510569	I00004	Alternatively, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) can be identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantified using real-time PCR, requiring specific primers for the amplification of target sequences [5].

PMC5405715	D03005	Interestingly, only AZ_3a contains a collection of close homologues of S. pneumoniae virulence genes, in particular those coding for pneumolysin Ply together with autolysin LytA, cholin-binding protein CbpG, and hyaluronidases HylA/HysA (the latter three, however, are also found in a few other strains).
PMC5405715	D06002	However, though closely related, S. oralis and S. tigurinus can be genetically and phenotypically separated by the presence or absence of gtfR and dextran, as well as IgA protease production.
PMC5405715	I03002	Furthermore, by applying S. tigurinus– and virulence factor–specific polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), the prevalence, abundance, and virulence of this species in saliva and on buccal mucosal membranes of 35 healthy adults were determined.
PMC5405715	R05006	These virulence factors include: cbpG, coding for a pneumococcal cholin binding serine protease with adhesive properties; hylA and hysA homologues, coding for hyaluronidases; the pneumolysin-gene ply, coding for a pore-forming toxin; and the autolysin-gene lytA, coding for a peptidoglycan hydrolase.
PMC5405715	R05007	On the other hand, all typical (sensu stricto) S. oralis strains differ from S. tigurinus(–like) not only in the presence of gtfR (here identified as a gtfD–gtfG homologue), but also in zmpC, encoding a zinc-metalloproteinase involved in neutrophil extravasation, inflammation, and tissue remodeling, and in possessing iga encoding an immunoglobulin A1 protease, both typically found in S. pneumoniae.
PMC5405715	R07001	To confirm that gftR-positive strains actually do produce dextran by glycosyltransferase activity, a Mitis Salivarius Agar or Columbia Blood Agar medium was enriched with 5% sucrose.
PMC5410709	D12006	The posterior insula was also associated with abundance of a subunit of butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase, an enzyme used by intestinal bacteria such as Faecalibacterium in the final step of butyrate synthesis [73, 74].
PMC5410709	D12007	Butyrate has histone deacetylase activity and signals through GRP43 and GRP109a (expressed by enterochromaffin cells, vagal afferents, and microglia), all potential mechanisms by which it could influence brain function or structure [75].

PMC5410709	R22008	Of these, we focused on two metagenes enriched in IBS1 that are involved in neurotransmitter metabolism—4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, which degrades γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and glutamate dehydrogenase, which mediates glutamate synthesis/breakdown—and on two metagenes enriched in IBS1 that are involved in short chain fatty acid metabolism—acetate co-A transferase subunit B, which mediates the final step of butyrate synthesis, and propionate catabolism operon regulatory protein, which regulates an operon of propionate catabolism genes (Fig. 5a).
PMC5410709	R22010	This highlighted a prominent role for one particular taxon, an unclassified Peptostreptococcaceae, which had a trend toward significant correlation (p = .058) with the right inferior segment of the circular sulcus though it fell short of significance as compared to the metagene encoding 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (p = .008) (Fig. 5b).

PMC5433236	A01000	In order to examine the TMA-forming potential of microbial communities, we established databases for the key genes of the main TMA-synthesis pathways, encoding choline TMA-lyase (cutC) and carnitine oxygenase (carnitine oxygenase), using a multi-level screening approach on 67,134 genomes revealing 1107 and 6738 candidates to exhibit cutC and carnitine oxygenase, respectively.
PMC5433236	D01002	[6] and carnitine oxygenase [7] were previously described.
PMC5433236	D01004	However, the yeaW gene displays close sequence identity (74%) to the carnitine oxygenase model sequence from A. baumannii and is arranged in similar operons that additionally encode a reductase (yeaX and cntB, respectively) as well as a betaine/carnitine/choline transporter, and for both enzymes, promiscuity to transform carnitine and butyrobetaine at similar rates was shown (yeaW/X was reported to act on choline and to a lesser extent on betaine as well).

PMC5433236	D02005	Nevertheless, some sequences comprised in our databases are not expected to be amplified, as the carnitine oxygenase forward primer does not match a few Betaproteobacteria, and in the case of cutC, a few sequences observed in Streptococcus show ≥2 mismatches with the reverse primer.
PMC5433236	D05000	TMA formation via carnitine oxygenase represents a distinctive branch of TMA synthesis where, next to the enzyme’s distinct substrate spectrum compared with the choline TMA-lyase, ecophysiologic features of its key player, E. coli, are substantially different to those of the major cutC-exhibiting taxa.
PMC5433236	D05003	In fact, results of the two pathways did not correlate, which is highlighted by two samples derived from the HMP dataset that display exceptionally high amounts of carnitine oxygenase, but only minute cutC abundances (Fig. 4).

PMC5433236	M00000	Databases for the key genes cutC and carnitine oxygenase were built using a multiparametric approach similar to that previously described for butyrate producers [16].
PMC5433236	M00002	cutC, ACL49259, ABB40076, EDU36695, EEU12078, EFJ62362, EEW38822, EEI47333; carnitine oxygenase, EFF74816, EGJ58898, EEW98385, EHL80614, EFK52065, EEW40126, EHL93080, EGQ26304) were aligned in Clustal Omega [17] and used to construct hidden Markov models (HMM) on full-length proteins via hmmbuild (default mode, HMMER 3.1b1, hmmer.org).
PMC5433236	M00005	The top 3000 and 10,000 protein sequences (based on HMM score) from cutC and carnitine oxygenase searches, respectively, were collapsed (function derep [18]) and aligned to the HMM models (hmmalign in default mode).
PMC5433236	M00009	Finally, genomes were screened for cutD and cntB (hmmsearch) using HMMs that were built (hmmbuild, hmmalign cycles as described above) from protein sequences that derived from the same genomes that contain the cutC/cntA seed sequences used above (to obtain seed sequences, reference sequences of cutD (ACL49260) and cntB (EEX03957) were BLASTED (blastp, v. 2.2.28+) against respective genomes; all seed sequences were in direct synteny (based on locus tag) with respective partner genes cutC and carnitine oxygenase; no cntB for Sporosarcina newyorkensis was found).
PMC5433236	M00011	Subsequently, their synteny with respective partner genes cutC and carnitine oxygenase was determined where genes separated by ≤10 genes (based on locus tag) were considered as syntenous.
PMC5433236	M00013	For carnitine oxygenase, phylogeny was applied as an additional filter to the HMM score and 43 sequences (34 unique proteins; including S. newyorkensis) that displayed HMM similarities above the set cutoff were omitted yielding 6738 genomes that exhibit 6772 candidate genes (491 unique proteins).
PMC5433236	M02001	We modified previously published primers [9] in order to amplify cutC, while primers targeting carnitine oxygenase were designed in-house (Table 1).
PMC5433236	M02006	An initial 95 °C step for 15 min was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s; annealing at 57 and 53 °C for cutC and carnitine oxygenase, respectively, for 45 s; and an extension step at 72 °C for 45 s deploying final primer concentrations of 2.5 and 0.75 μM for cutC and carnitine oxygenase, respectively.
PMC5433236	M02009	aestuarii (DSM 17919) was used for cutC quantifications, whereas E. coli K12 (DSM 10517) DNA served as the standard for carnitine oxygenase. Results are expressed as averages of three independent experiments, normalized to the total 16S rRNA gene copies from each sample using previously described primers [22] applying an annealing temperature of 55 °C.
PMC5433236	M03002	The genes cutC and carnitine oxygenase were amplified using the primers and amplification conditions as described above for qPCR (applying only 20 cycles).
PMC5433236	M03004	The PCR products were purified again (PureLink PCR Purification Kit; Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) and subjected to a third amplification step that added the two indices and Illumina adapters to amplicons using PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Shigu, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PMC5433236	M03007	Amplicons were separated by gel electrophoresis, and the appropriate size was excised (cutC ~480, carnitine oxygenase ~460) and extracted with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
PMC5433236	M04001	The reference sets for each gene contained all unique sequences considered as cutC and carnitine oxygenase genes, respectively, as well as the 300 top-scoring unique protein sequences below the set HMM thresholds representing distinct sequences (see the “Constructing the databases” and “Results” sections; the 34 sequences derived from Bacilli located above the threshold though not considered as true carnitine oxygenase were included as well) as previously performed for butyrate producers [24].
PMC5433236	M04004	On average, 98.2% (cutC) and 92.5% (carnitine oxygenase) of all merged sequences passed these initial steps resulting in a mean of 40,915 ± 12,376 cutC sequences per sample (from 23,696 to 71,952) and 42,079 ± 7746 carnitine oxygenase sequences (from 28,471 to 52,687) derived from 50 and 12 samples, respectively.
PMC5433236	M04005	For carnitine oxygenase, sample 3 was omitted as >99% of obtained sequences (from 13,095) failed FrameBot analysis (this sample was also on the borderline of detection in qPCR and produced only a faint band during PCR amplification).
PMC5433236	M05001	As for the amplicon analysis above, the reference set of each gene additionally included sequences that were below the set HMM threshold (500 top-scoring unique nucleotide sequences; for cutD and cntB, the threshold was defined by the lowest scoring gene that was syntenous with its partner gene; sequences derived from Bacilli located above the threshold though not considered as true carnitine oxygenase were included as well).
PMC5433236	M06003	Amplification was performed with the PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Shigu, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PMC5433236	R00001	Comprehensive databases for cutC and carnitine oxygenase were established applying a multi-level screening approach on 67,134 genomes provided by the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC).
PMC5433236	R00003	All genes comprised in this database will be referred to as carnitine oxygenase throughout the study (see also the “Discussion” section).
PMC5433236	R01001	Additionally, synteny with the associated activator gene (cutD) as well as the reductase (cntB) that were both shown to be essential for TMA production in the corresponding pathways was investigated.
PMC5433236	R02000	Putative carnitine oxygenase genes were identified in 6738 genomes (491 dereplicated protein sequences) where the majority was observed in Proteobacteria, especially Gammaproteobacteria (mostly derived from Escherichia and Acinetobacter), and some entries belonging to Betaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria (Fig. 1b, Additional file 1B, Additional file 2B).
PMC5433236	R02003	Specifically, 34 lower-scoring sequences from Bacilli are neither in close phylogenetic relation to the top-scoring sequences nor do they exhibit syntenic cntB sequences and were, hence, not considered as true carnitine oxygenase (see also Additional file 1D).
PMC5433236	R02005	Revealed candidates exhibit carnitine oxygenase as a single copy gene, except for 31 genomes, mainly A. baumannii and E. coli strains, where more than one target was detected.
PMC5433236	R02006	However, the majority of those sequences were identical to other carnitine oxygenase genes in the respective genomes, and only two candidates (Klebsiella pneumoniae BIDMC 18C and Cupriavidus taiwanensis STM 6070) exhibited two non-identical carnitine oxygenase sequences.
PMC5433236	R03000	Gene-targeted assays for cutC and carnitine oxygenase were developed in order to determine the potential of the gut microbiota to produce TMA and to characterize the composition of this functional community in detail.
PMC5433236	R03001	In silico analysis on coverage of developed primers suggested that a broad range of cutC and carnitine oxygenase gene sequences are targeted, namely 93 and 96% of all unique cutC and carnitine oxygenase genes, respectively (allowing for one mismatch in each primer).
PMC5433236	R04002	CntA was quantified in 13 samples displaying large abundance differences ranging from 0.03 to 2.17% of bacteria possessing carnitine oxygenase, with only three samples displaying an abundance ≥0.5%.
PMC5433236	R04005	In the carnitine oxygenase qPCR, two samples (10 and 19) showed a single unspecific band (sequencing confirmed them as non-target (data not shown)) and samples were, hence, not considered as positive for the gene; one sample displayed two bands.
PMC5433236	R04006	The qPCR on one third diluted samples indicated quantities of 40.6% ± 12.2% and 39.9% ± 22.2% of undiluted samples for cutC and carnitine oxygenase (five samples were on the borderline of detection), respectively, evidencing that the PCR mixtures were devoid of any interfering ingredients.
PMC5433236	R06000	In contrast, all carnitine oxygenase sequences obtained were similar to those previously observed in Gammaproteobacteria, in particular from Escherichia/Shigella (Fig. 2c); closest match analysis revealed 98.1% being closely related to sequences from E. coli (data not shown).
PMC5433236	R06001	A few communities additionally contained carnitine oxygenase amplicons similar to those previously detected in Citrobacter and Klebsiella.
PMC5433236	R09005	In contrast, reads indicating the presence of cntA/B were nearly identical to references (99.6% ± 1.1% and 99.8% ± 0.8% for carnitine oxygenase and cntB, respectively) and predominantly related to Gammaproteobacteria, in particular to Escherichia/Shigella and Klebsiella.
PMC5433236	R10001	Our results indicated increased abundances of bacteria exhibiting the potential to produce TMA (by about a factor of 2) in the patient group where the abundances of key genes of both pathways were elevated (median values of 0.39 and 0.11% (patient group) versus 0.22 and 0% (controls) for cutC and carnitine oxygenase, respectively, as a percentage of bacteria calculated to exhibit the genes) (Additional file 8).
PMC5433236	R12009	Overall, strains are predicted to contain 101 ± 79 glycoside hydrolases (GHs), 41 ± 13 glycosyltransferases (GTs), 25 ± 17 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), 26 ± 13 carbohydrate esterases (CEs), and 4 ± 4 polysaccharide lyases (PLs).

PMC5476646	R14000	PFL produces acetyl-CoA and formate from pyruvate and coenzyme-A. PFL requires a ‘pyruvate formate-lyase activase’ and co-occurs with a replacement part, an ‘autonomous glycyl radical cofactor’, both of which were present in the two genomes.

PMC6024637	D00003	A recent study of mice showed that intraperitoneal butyrate administration reduced persistent lung inflammation during Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, leading to the suggestion that butyrate restores interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in the lung by inhibiting histone deacetylase.12 Anti-inflammatory properties have been described in the intestine, where butyrate through the same IL-10-dependent mechanism was associated with heightened tolerance of macrophages toward the residing microbiota.11 Finally, as butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria have been associated with promotion of T-regulatory cells and reduced incidence of graft-versus-host disease, a decrease of butyrate-producing bacteria might be associated with increased graft-versus-host disease and increased exposure to immunosuppressive agents such as steroids, which is a known risk factor for LRTI.24,25

PMC6146992	I00010	Generally, nonoxidative aromatic acid decarboxylases, such gallate decarboxylase, are encoded by a 3-gene operon that encodes the 3 subunits of decarboxylases (B, C, and D subunits) (9).
PMC6146992	I00012	Although LpdC is the only protein responsible for the catalytic activity in vitro, LpdB is also essential for decarboxylase activity in vivo (7).
PMC6146992	I00013	The L. plantarum gallate decarboxylase was genetically identified and characterized (7).
PMC6146992	I00014	Genes similar to L. plantarum gallate decarboxylase genes were found in other food-related lactic acid bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus brevis, and Oenococcus oeni, among others.
PMC6146992	I00015	Moreover, the presence of decarboxylase genes was associated with gallate decarboxylation and pyrogallol production (7).
PMC6146992	I02001	More specifically, optimized PCR primers for amplification of the C catalytic subunit of the gallate decarboxylase gene (lpdC) were designed to detect the presence of decarboxylases involved in gallate metabolism in the human gut (HTS-lpdC method).
PMC6146992	I02002	HTS analysis revealed the dominant and subdominant genera and species with potential gallate decarboxylase activities.
PMC6146992	I02003	The presence of functional gallate decarboxylase activity in the identified species demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed HTS method.
PMC6146992	R00001	Food gallotannins are hydrolyzed to gallic acid by an esterase enzyme (tannase), and the gallic acid formed is decarboxylated to pyrogallol by the action of gallate decarboxylase (8, 12); these enzymes have recently been described for L. plantarum WCFS1 (7, 13, 14).
PMC6146992	R00002	Among lactic acid bacteria, L. plantarum is the prototypical species possessing tannase activity.
PMC6146992	R01001	To examine the abundance and conservation of gallate decarboxylase proteins in the genus Lactobacillus, a comparative analysis was used to identify enzymes homologous to the catalytic C subunit, LpdC. Amino acid sequences homologous to the functional LpdC from L. plantarum WCFS1 (7) were identified in type strains of 28 species in the genus Lactobacillus.
PMC6146992	R01002	Additionally, a comparative analysis to identify enzymes homologous to tannase was performed (Fig. 1).
PMC6146992	R01003	The analysis clearly revealed the extended presence and conservation of LpdC among lactobacilli, with >70% identity, in contrast to the scarcity of the tannase enzyme.
PMC6146992	R01004	These results are in agreement with previous studies in which tannase (12, 16) or gallate decarboxylase (7) activity among lactic acid bacteria was analyzed.
PMC6146992	R01005	Given that the latter study also revealed that, across the lactic acid bacteria assayed, gallate decarboxylase activity corresponded to the presence of the lpdC gene (7), we selected this gene to study the distribution and abundance of dietary gallate metabolism in the human gut microbiota.
PMC6146992	R03004	Phylogenetic assignment of HTS data allowed the successful allocation of 367 sequences at the species level (with an average of 127 species per sample) using Bowtie 2 (21), with a maximum of 1 mismatch in every read against a nucleotide database of 40,552 sequences for the 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase (UbiD) gene downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) website.
PMC6146992	R05004	To our knowledge, no other human gut bacterial species with gallate decarboxylase activity have been described so far.
PMC6146992	R06001	2C and ​and3,3, gallate decarboxylase genes were identified in gut microbiota samples that were homologous to genes present in the genomes of Hungatella hathewayi DSM 13479, Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 3_1_53, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047, Actinomyces glycerinitolerans, Anaerostipes hadrus DSM 3319, Enterococcus raffinosus ATCC 49464, Pediococcus ethanolidurans DSM 22301, Klebsiella michiganensis KCTC 1686
PMC6146992	R07002	phyla were grown in the presence of gallic acid (3 mM) to detect functional gallate decarboxylase activity, as predicted by the HTS-lpdC method.
PMC6146992	R09001	The gallate decarboxylase C subunit from L. plantarum WCFS1 (LpdC) is erroneously annotated as 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase (UbiD) (7).
PMC6146992	R09002	In gallate decarboxylases, ubiD-like genes are located within operons that encode partner proteins that are required for decarboxylation (7).
PMC6146992	R09004	To date, only in the genome of L. plantarum has it been noted that the genes encoding gallate decarboxylase are not clustered.
PMC6146992	R09005	In this instance, the gene encoding the C subunit, lpdC or lp_2945, is located close to the tannase-encoding gene (tanLp1 or lp_2956).
PMC6146992	R09008	Furthermore, in the species in which the gene encoding the B subunit is clustered together with the C subunit determinant, this study revealed the existence of different gene organizations among these decarboxylases, i.e., a minority BC gene arrangement (such as in H. hathewayi, an Erysipelotrichaceae species, and Enterobacter cloacae) or a widely represented CB arrangement (in Enterococcus raffinosus, P. ethanolidurans, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, K. michiganensis, C. butyricum, and S. gallolyticus, among others) (Fig. 3).
PMC6146992	R09010	As shown in Fig. 3, some of the human gut microbiota species containing gallate decarboxylase genes also contain a tannase-encoding gene in the same region of the genome (as observed in C. butyricum, A. tropicalis, and S. gallolyticus).
PMC6146992	R09011	Similar to findings for Lactobacillus species, gallate decarboxylase-encoding genes were more common than the corresponding esterase (tannase) activity in the athlete gut microbiota samples.
PMC6146992	R09012	The presence of gallate decarboxylase but not tannase activity in some bacteria could suggest a cooperative process among commensal bacteria in dietary tannin metabolism.
PMC6146992	R09013	In addition, in the human gut microbiota, it could be imagined that other bacterial species could possess appropriate mechanisms to further degrade the pyrogallol produced by these gallate decarboxylases.
PMC6146992	R11004	The results clearly show the successful use of the HTS-lpdC method to identify functional gallate decarboxylases in complex microbial communities and the subsequent use of this gene in a phylogenetic approach to investigate the gut microbiome according to activities involved in the metabolism of a relevant dietary component.
PMC6146992	R11009	In this regard, the results shown in this work indicate that gallate decarboxylase activity, which is key for metabolism of the gallates present in plant-derived foods, is present in members of the main genera in the human gut, and this feature could be an advantage for surviving in this environment.

PMC6266421	D05003	A virus enters the host cell by binding to receptors that contain SA in the cell membrane; the release of IAV from the cell membrane, in turn, requires hydrolysis of the SA linkage by the neuraminidase.1 Interestingly, mucins seem to play a protective role against influenza virus infection in mice overexpressing Muc5ac.36 Severe disease by influenza virus might be prevented by the presence of great amounts of mucins on the respiratory tract.

PMC6375204	A02003	Analysis of the carboxyl terminal residues of these peptides indicated that neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G were responsible for their generation, and accordingly, these patients had higher levels of proteolytic activity from these enzymes in their sputum.
PMC6375204	D02003	This cleavage pattern was described previously by Schilling and Overall [25] when human neutrophil elastase (neutrophil elastase) and cathepsin G (CG) were incubated with a cellular extract from human embryonic kidney cells.
PMC6375204	D02004	neutrophil elastase had a preference for cleavage between Val-Ser and Val-Gly bonds while CG had a preference for Phe-Gly, Phe-Ser, Met-Gly, and Met-Ser.
PMC6375204	D02005	These assays indicated that the peptides detected in the mass spectrometry data were being produced by these neutrophil proteases.
PMC6375204	D02006	Accordingly, neutrophil proteins (including neutrophil elastase itself) were found to be more abundant in the metabolome of patients with reduced lung function enriched in peptides.
PMC6375204	D02007	We therefore anticipated that there would be a concomitant increase in protease activity in these same patient samples, and our fluorescent reporter substrates containing P1-Val and P1-Phe confirmed this, showing abundant neutrophil elastase and CG activity in sputum from patients with reduced lung function.
PMC6375204	D02008	neutrophil elastase has been shown to be highly active in CF lungs and associated with lung function decline [26, 27].
PMC6375204	D02013	P. aeruginosa also produces proteases that may contribute to lung proteolysis [29]; however, conditioned media from this bacterium did not have enzymes that could cleave the fluorescent neutrophil elastase substrate.
PMC6375204	D02014	In summary, our data shows that in patients with more severe lung disease, neutrophil proteases degrade host proteins into peptides and amino acids and these metabolites can be found in CF lung mucus.
PMC6375204	D03006	The action of neutrophil proteases could contribute to shaping the niche space that P. aeruginosa comes to dominate in a severely diseased CF lung by providing its preferred carbon source.
PMC6375204	D06001	We hypothesize that the CF lung becomes a favored environment for persistence of P. aeruginosa in part because this bacterium promotes recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their proteases generate peptides and amino acids that are a favored carbon source of the pathogen [30–33, 38].

PMC6483181	R04000	These disruption steps were followed by an additional digestion step with Proteinase K, a broad-spectrum serine protease, to remove any protein contamination and inactivate any remaining DNAase activity prior to cell and nuclear lysis.
PMC6483181	R04001	We tested a range of proteinase concentrations; while inclusion of the enzyme was important in enhancing DNA extraction efficiency, varying the proteinase concentration had much less effect.

PMC6593728	I01001	As one of the most virulent pathogenicity islands genes, CagA is able to perturb multiple host signaling pathways by acting as a hub or extrinsic scaffold protein, in turn potentiating malignant transformation.9 CagA can interact with multiple cell components and activate multiple signaling molecules downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase growth factors, therefore causing a set of complex cellular alterations, for example, enhanced proliferation and attenuated apoptosis, changes in epithelial cell morphology and polarity, and prevention of the assembly of apical junctions.9 A serologic response to CagA in H pylori‐infected patients was found to be strongly associated with peptic ulceration.10 Oncogenic potential of CagA has been proved in animal experiments.11, 12 People infected by cagA ‐positive H pylori strains have a higher risk of developing gastric carcinoma compared to those infected with cagA‐negative strins.13 CagA‐positive H pylori strains also participate in the inflammatory response, through the production of certain cytokines such as IL‐1β and IL‐8, and activation of NF‐κB.14 Thus, infection of CagA+ H pylori strains can alter both the local and systematic environments, which might consequently influence the local and distant microbiota in the host.
PMC6593728	R00000	It was shown that pyrosequencing method detectedH pylori sequences in about 60% of samples that were H pylori negative by a combination of conventional testing (histology, rapid urease test, and culture),24 which emphasizes the use of NGS as a more sensitive method for determining H pylori infection.

PMC6593792	I01002	In the intestinal mucosa, 5‐ASA is acetylated to its inactive metabolite N‐acetyl‐5‐ASA (Ac‐5‐ASA), mainly by the enzyme N‐acetyl‐transferase 1 (NAT1), and to a small degree by N‐acetyl‐transferase 2 (NAT2).8, 9 Orally administered unbound 5‐ASA is absorbed and inactivated in the small intestinal mucosa and in the liver, thus only small amounts 5‐ASA will reach the colonic mucosa.3, 10 Therefore, several pharmaceutical delivery systems have been developed to transport orally administered 5‐ASA to the colon.
PMC6593792	I03003	5‐ASA has previously also been reported to affect intestinal bacteria, by inhibiting growth of anaerobic strains, reducing bacterial invasiveness and total faecal bacterial abundance,29, 30, 31 as well as reducing bacterial adherent biofilm thickness and Escherichia and Shigella abundances in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).21, 32 Results from a recent study also suggest that 5‐ASA acts as a polyP‐kinase inhibitor, thereby decreasing some bacteria's ability to colonise and increase their susceptibility to oxidative stress.33

PMC6765283	R06001	ACT75_RS08345, a putative molybdenum cofactor guanylyltransferase, was not essential in monoinfection but became essential in coinfection with Actinomyces oris.
PMC6765283	R06004	Second, we compared our Tn-seq data to a previous analysis of an ATP synthase mutant in monoinfection and coinfection with Streptococcus gordonii (19).
PMC6765283	R09009	Among these were cydA and cydB, which encode components of the cytochrome bd complex, the sole aerobic respiratory oxidase in A. actinomycetemcomitans.
PMC6765283	R09011	Finally, genes encoding the C and D subunits of the NADH:ubiquinone reductase [Na(+)-transporting], which is involved in respiratory metabolism, were core essential genes.
PMC6765283	R09012	In addition, 3 genes encoding components of the spermidine/putrescine ABC transporter and 3 genes encoding proteins involved in the Tol-Pal system were always essential in coinfection.
PMC6765283	R13002	The 4 additional components of the NADH:ubiquinone reductase [Na(+)-transporting] were accessory essential genes required in the majority of conditions.
PMC6765283	R13003	Furthermore, in addition to the 1 component of the FOF1 ATP synthase that was a core essential gene, genes encoding 6 additional components of the ATP synthase were accessory essential genes.
PMC6765283	R13004	A. actinomycetemcomitans required all 6 additional ATP synthase genes for fitness in coinfection with A. israelii, A. oris, B. cenocepacia, Enterococcus faecalis, F. nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella intermedia, S. pyogenes, and Streptococcus sanguinis, as well as in monoinfection.
PMC6765283	R13005	In contrast, A. actinomycetemcomitans required no additional genes encoding the ATP synthase in coinfection with S. cerevisiae, and only 2 genes with Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae.
PMC6765283	R13008	Finally, the gene encoding ArcA, a regulator activated in anaerobic conditions, was essential with 13 coinfection microbes that range from obligate aerobes to obligate anaerobes, and the gene encoding superoxide dismutase was essential in 11 of 26 conditions, indicating increased oxygen stress during coinfection with some microbes.
PMC6765283	R16004	In addition, a gene annotated to encode a toxin-activating lysine-acyltransferase was only essential in monoinfection and in coinfection with Filifactor alocis.
PMC6765283	R16005	The putative product of this gene, LtxC, is an acetyltransferase thought to activate the A. actinomycetemcomitans virulence factor RTX toxin, leukotoxin (LtxA) (36).
PMC6765283	R17001	Compared to monoinfection, many of the genetic requirements alleviated across these 3 conditions include: Genes encoding the Flp pilus, which mediates adhesion; genes encoding ATP synthase subunits; and genes encoding proteins involved in deoxyribose synthesis.
PMC6765283	R17002	Therefore, adhesion and ATP synthase are not as critical for A. actinomycetemcomitans survival in the presence of these microbes in the murine abscess model, and A. actinomycetemcomitans has a reduced need to synthesize DNA building blocks.
PMC6765283	R18003	For example, 2 genes encoding subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase are essential in over 18 coinfection conditions.
PMC6765283	R18004	It is notable that the only coinfection condition where neither identified component of pyruvate dehydrogenase becomes essential is coinfection with B. cenocepacia.
PMC6765283	R18006	In addition, tatA and tatC were coinfection-specific essential genes and essential in 15 and 14 conditions, respectively, indicating that the twin-arginine translocase is important in many coinfections.
PMC6765283	R19006	A. actinomycetemcomitans carbon metabolism is likely also altered in the presence of these 3 strains, as a number of genes involved in the TCA cycle and genes encoding a 1-phosphofructokinase and subunits of mannose and fructose PTS transporters are induced CoDE genes in these conditions.

PMC7019425	R09000	The GNB/LNB transporter was first isolated and identified to be responsible for the uptake of LNB that is extracellularly liberated from LNT by lacto-N-biosidase (LnbB from B. bifidum and LnbX from B. longum)
PMC7019425	R09001	[43,44] and for the uptake of GNB that is liberated from mucin O-glycans by endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase [63].
PMC7019425	R17001	[32,48,58,67,68,70], GNB/LNB-BP (GltA), LNnT-BP (NahS), and the intracellular enzymes required for degrading them (GNB/LNB phosphorylase, LNT β-1,3-galactosidase, two β-1,4-galactosidases (LacZ2/6), and one β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NahA)) are highly conserved (Figure 2).
PMC7019425	R17002	B. breve commonly possesses an intracellular GH95 α-l-fucosidase, albeit that the prevalence of FL1-BP (4% occurrence) and FL2-BP (8% occurrence) is remarkably low.
PMC7019425	R19000	Extracellular GH136 lacto-N-biosidase (LnbX) is detected for 38% of B. longum genomes (151 examined) (Figure 2).
PMC7019425	R19001	LnbX-positive strains use GNB/LNB-BP (GltA) for LNB uptake and GNB/LNB phosphorylase (LNB phosphorylase) for subsequent intracellular phosphorolysis, while LnbX-negative strains use LNT β-1,3-galactosidase for hydrolysis of LNT inside the cells.
PMC7019425	R19002	GltA, LNB phosphorylase, GH42 LNT β-1,3-galactosidase, GH2 β-1,4-galactosidase (Bga2A homolog), and GH20 β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Blon_0732 homolog) are highly conserved in B. longum, which is in agreement with the fact that this species commonly uses LNB and LNT [32,58,65,67].
PMC7019425	R19003	Consistent with the observation that B. longum strains that are capable of utilizing fucosylated HMOs are rare, we found that the prevalence of FL2-BP (3% occurrence) and α-l-fucosidases (≤3%) was quite low.
PMC7019425	R21001	About half of the strains of those examined for this species were capable of assimilating LNB, as mentioned above [67], but lacked the GNB/LNB phosphorylase gene homolog.
PMC7019425	R21003	The FL2-BP (13%) and GH95 α-l-fucosidase (13%) homologs were sporadically detected, which is consistent with the report that several strains of this species utilize 2′-FL, 3-FL, and LDFT mixture as the carbon source [12].
PMC7019425	R24002	The data mining analysis revealed that the abundances of the extracellular glycosidase genes are indistinguishable in between the fecal DNAs obtained from formula-fed infants and breast-fed infants (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S5).
PMC7019425	R31003	In addition, the growth stimulatory effect of B. bifidum on other Bifidobacterium species observed for HMO-supplemented fecal cultures disappeared when fuconojirimycin, a potent fucosidase inhibitor (both for GH29 and GH95), was added to the media [57,66].

PMC7040164	D05003	Furthermore, the abnormal increase in Enterococcus could also cause excessive activation of tyrosine decarboxylase, which increases the decarboxylation of tyrosine and phenylalanine in the gastrointestinal tract, leading to decreased levels in the CNS and subsequent low levels of levodopa (the drug precursor of dopamine) (Maini Rekdal et al., 2019).
