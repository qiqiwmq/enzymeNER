PMC1134064	D00003	The copper-containing amine oxidase and CD36 are shown to be the major extracellular-orientated proteins, whereas caveolin-1 is the main cytosol-orientated protein in these caveolae.

PMC1134064	D01006	EHD2 (Table ​(Table3),3), also found in caveolae for the first time, belongs to a family of conserved EHD-containing proteins [43], which function in endocytosis and in signal-transduction pathways downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases [44].

PMC1134064	M00002	Adipocytes were isolated by collagenase digestion of subcutaneous human fat tissue and homogenized as described in [7].
PMC1134064	R02004	The 100 kDa protein was identified as a membrane copper-containing amine oxidase (Table ​(Table2).2).
PMC1134064	R02005	This protein is also referred to as semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase [27] or vascular adhesion protein VAP-1 in endothelial cells [28].
PMC1134064	R02008	In addition to caveolin, CD36 and copper-containing amine oxidase were also determined as the major protein constituents of immunopurified caveolae from rat adipocytes [14].
PMC1134064	R06001	However, six of the proteins, namely annexin V, R-Ras, Ras suppressor protein 1, SRBC (serum deprivation response-related gene product that binds to C-kinase; a protein kinase Cδ-binding protein), EHD2 (EHD-containing protein 2, where EHD stands for Eps15-homology domain) and PTRF, have not been specifically localized to caveolae previous to our work.

PMC1794502	A00006	These latter spots corresponded to 11 proteins or protein fragments, including serum albumin fragments (13 spots), 5 previously recognized proteins (7 spots), and 4 proteins (3 spots) that had not been previously described in human BALF maps, namely calumenin, cytohesin-2, cystatin SN, and mitochondrial DNA topoisomerase 1 (mtDNA TOP1).
PMC1794502	A00009	Whereas levels of glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP), Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase (superoxide dismutase) and cystatin SN were downregulated in SScFib+ patients compared with SScFib- patients, we observed a significant upregulation of α1-acid glycoprotein, haptoglobin-α chain, calgranulin (Cal) B, cytohesin-2, calumenin, and mtDNA TOP1 in SScFib+ patients.
PMC1794502	A00010	Some of these proteins (GSTP, Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase, and cystatin SN) seem to be involved in mechanisms that protect lungs against injury or inflammation, whereas others (Cal B, cytohesin-2, and calumenin) seem to be involved in mechanisms that drive lung fibrogenesis.
PMC1794502	D01002	Some of these spots corresponded to previously described BALF proteins and protein fragments, namely α1-acid glycoprotein, GSTP, Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase, haptoglobin-α chain, and calgranulin B, whereas 4 of the proteins found had not previously been described in published two-dimensional BALF maps, namely cytohesin-2, calumenin, cystatin SN, and human mtDNA TOP1 fragment.
PMC1794502	D01003	In SScFib+ patients, GSTP and cystatin SN were below the detection limit, whereas Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase was downregulated.
PMC1794502	D03001	Among various enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms that protect cells and tissues from oxidants [26,27], glutathione transferases [28] and SODs [29] are among such mechanisms that are thought to have a key protective role, especially in the lung.
PMC1794502	D03004	The observation that GSTP and Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase levels are severely downregulated in BALF from SScFib+ patients is in line with these findings, and confirms the relevance of these molecules as a defense tool for the lung against oxidant-induced damage and/or fibroproliferation.
PMC1794502	D04001	Cystatin SN is a secreted protein, which belongs to SD-type or type-2 cystatins [31], which are potent inhibitors of CA clan mammalian cysteine peptidases.
PMC1794502	D04003	The direct inhibition of endogenous and exogenous cysteine peptidases is the only function described so far for cystatin SN, suggesting that its function is to protect tissues against injury induced by these enzymes.
PMC1794502	D08001	Although its biological function is mostly unknown, a recent study demonstrated that cytohesin-2 is an activator of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway [44].
PMC1794502	D08002	Because MAP kinases are activator signals for lung fibroblasts [23], we suggest that cytohesin-2 might participate in the development and/or progression of lung fibrosis in SSc patients through the activation of the MAP kinase signaling pathways in lung fibroblasts.

PMC1794502	R02002	These 24 differently expressed spots corresponded to 11 proteins/protein fragments in total: 13 spots corresponded to serum albumin fragments, 7 of them corresponded to 5 previously recognized BALF proteins (α1-acid glycoprotein (2 spots), haptoglobin-α chain (2 spots), calgranulin (Cal) B, Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase (superoxide dismutase) and glutathione S-transferase P (GSTP)), and 3 spots corresponded to 4 proteins that, to our knowledge, had not previously been described in published BALF two-dimensional maps (calumenin and cytohesin-2 (1 spot), cystatin SN and a fragment of mtDNA TOP1).
PMC1794502	R02007	Finally, whereas Cu–Zn superoxide dismutase was significantly downregulated, GSTP and cystatin SN were not detectable in SScFib+ patients in contrast with SScFib- patients.
PMC1797627	M02000	Serum samples were sequentially passed through protein A and Cibacron blue columns to remove IgG and albumin, respectively.
PMC1850944	D03007	One of the 5 spiked protein standards, rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (spiked at 40 μg/mL level), also reproducibly binds to the IgY-12 system (Table 2) in the 5 replicate LC-MS/MS analyses.
PMC1850944	D03008	However, a survey of the non-spiked plasma sample using 2D-LC-MS/MS revealed that human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase does not bind to the IgY-12 system at all at its normal plasma concentration.
PMC1850944	D03009	Six glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase unique peptides were identified only from the flow-through fraction and among them 3 peptides are unique to human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Supplemental Table 4), although the protein sequences of rabbit and human G3PDH have 94% in common.
PMC1850944	D03010	These results suggest that the binding of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase to the IgY-12 system may be concentration dependent; however, the exact mechanism remains unclear.
PMC1850944	M01002	To generate a spiked plasma sample, bovine carbonic anhydrase II, rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and bovine β-lactoglobulin (Sigma, St Louis, MO) were added to unprocessed human plasma samples to final concentrations of 40 μg/mL, and equine skeletal muscle myoglobin and chicken ovalbumin (Sigma) were added to final concentrations of 4 μg/mL. Unless otherwise noted, all protein sample processing was performed at 4 °C.
PMC1850944	R03000	The detection of the 5 non-human protein standards (i.e., 40 μg/mL each of bovine carbonic anhydrase II, rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and bovine β-lactoglobulin, and 4 μg/mL each of equine myoglobin and chicken ovalbumin) from the replicate LC-MS/MS analyses is summarized in Table 1.
PMC1850944	R03001	Almost all of the peptides from the 5 non-human proteins were observed exclusively in the flow-through fraction, except for rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase.
PMC1850944	R03003	While non-specific binding of rabbit glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was observed (i.e., the protein was identified in both bound and flow-through fractions), the extent of non-specific binding for this protein was reproducible, which is key for quantitative studies.
PMC1850944	R06006	A number of proteins bound significantly to the IgY-12 column, such as zinc-α2-glycoprotein, apolipoproteins (C I, CIII, D, E, and L1), CD 5 antigen-like protein, serum amyloid proteins A2 and A4, transthyretin, hemoglobin, serum paraoxonase/arylesterase 1, and leucine-rich α-2-glycoprotein (Table 3).

PMC2408776	M01003	After quenching the endogenous peroxidase activity with 3% H2O2, the cells were incubated with 0.5% blocking reagent for 30 min (TSA-Direct kit, Dupont-NEN, Boston, MA) and then immunolabeled with one of the following antibodies at room temperature for 1 h: mouse monoclonal anti-fibronectin (1:200), rabbit polyclonal anti-laminin (1:200), mouse monoclonal anti-vimentin (1:200), mouse monoclonal anti-neuron specific enolase (1:200), and mouse monoclonal anti-Factor VIII (1:200).
PMC2408776	M01004	After incubation with the primary antibody, the cells were rinsed with PBS and incubated for an additional 45 min with biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:300; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:300, Vector Laboratories) where appropriate followed by avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex for 10 min.
PMC2408776	M01005	After a series of washes, the specimens were treated with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (DAB)/peroxidase reaction (Vector DAB substrate kit; Vector Laboratories), washed in water, treated with hematoxylin counterstain, washed again, and then dried at room temperature.

PMC2408776	R01005	Spot 3 was ribosomal protein S6 kinase (MW 61.7 kDa, pI 6.42).
PMC2413104	R00003	Overall, transferrin (TRF) and transthyretin (TTR) were down-regulated and 12-lipoxygenase (12-lipoxygenase), serum amyloid A1 protein precursor (SAA), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and lysine-specific histone demethylase1 (LSD1) were up-regulated in two NPC groups compared with the healthy group.
PMC2413104	R00004	Furthermore, increased expression levels of 12-lipoxygenase, sICAM-1 and SAA were observed in LNM NPC as compared with non-LNM NPC.
PMC2413104	R00005	However, heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and cytochrome P450 (cytochrome P450) were expressed significantly and constantly only in LNM NPC patients.
PMC2493375	A00000	Broad-spectrum matrix metalloproteinase (matrix metalloproteinase) inhibitors (MMPI) were unsuccessful in cancer clinical trials, partly due to side effects resulting from limited knowledge of the full repertoire of matrix metalloproteinase substrates, termed the substrate degradome, and hence the in vivo functions of MMPs.
PMC2493375	A00007	Considered together, this is a strong predictor of biologically relevant substrates cleaved in the cellular context that led to the identification of many undescribed MMP-14 substrates, 20 of which we validated biochemically, including DJ-1, galectin-1, Hsp90α, pentraxin 3, progranulin, Cyr61, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A, and dickkopf-1.
PMC2493375	A00009	Hence, this approach describes the dynamic pattern of cell membrane ectodomain shedding and its perturbation upon metalloproteinase drug treatment.
PMC2493375	D00004	By using MMP-14 transfection, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate stimulation, and MMPI blockade, we showed the dynamic nature of proteolytic shedding and that the accumulation of cleaved ectodomains and protein fragments was metalloproteinase dependent, executed by the cell surface membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase, MMP-14.
PMC2493375	D01000	In nonbiased quantitative proteomic approaches, criteria must be set to identify which of the myriad proteins whose levels are modulated by a protease are substrates and which are indirect effects wrought by an altered cellular signaling environment due to proteolytic processing of individual components of signaling pathways or ripples in the protease web.
PMC2493375	D01003	Some novel substrates can be inferred, since many proteins are substrates of more than one matrix metalloproteinase due to homology and redundancy of this protease family.
PMC2493375	D01006	This and the decreased MMPI/vehicle ICAT ratios are good indicators that IGFBP-7 and IGFBP-4 are also matrix metalloproteinase substrates.
PMC2493375	D02000	Here, candidate substrates were identified from a cellular environment, which supports the concept that they are indeed natural matrix metalloproteinase substrates.
PMC2493375	D02006	This likely reflects the different partitioning of these two proteases with respect to the substrate, to the cell membrane (MMP-14) and the secretome (MMP-2), emphasizing the need for cell-based analyses of proteolysis to determine biological relevance.
PMC2493375	D03001	These effects include release of a protein interactor of the processed protein or proteoglycan; the effects on a cascade in the protease web, for example, activation of a second protease by MMP-14, such as MMP-13 (59) or MMP-2 (112, 125), which then cleaves the substrate; altered signaling and hence transcriptional events; or inhibition of other metalloproteases, such as members of the ADAM/ADAM-TS families due to the broad specificity profile of some MMP-directed hydroxamate inhibitors.
PMC2493375	D03003	Elafin binds to extracellular matrix proteins via transglutaminase cross-linking mediated by its N-terminal domain (114).
PMC2493375	D03004	Thus, shedding of this inhibitor bound to the actual matrix metalloproteinase substrate is likely as elafin is also resistant to MMP-8 (48).
PMC2493375	D03005	This has been described for the chemokine KC, which binds to syndecan-1 (67), and peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase B (cyclophilin B), which binds heparan sulfate proteoglycans (2, 27) and which was also decreased in the conditioned medium from the MMPI-treated cells (MMPI/vehicle ICAT ratio, 0.64
PMC2493375	D04001	This is exemplified by the variety of known matrix metalloproteinase substrates identified, which included chemokines (GROα, IL-8), growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs, CTGF, TGF-beta binding protein-1S), cell surface receptors (uPAR, gC1qR, integrins), enzymes (MMP-1, uPA), and proteinase inhibitors (tissue factor pathway inhibitor, cystatin C), as well as extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (e.g., collagen [VI], laminin, fibrillin).
PMC2493375	D04003	Similarly, other proteins and novel substrates that were modulated by the MMPI are diverse, encompassing ECM proteins (epidermal growth factor-containing fibulin-like ECM protein 1, TSP-1, ECM-1), innate immunity and inflammatory mediators (pentraxin 3, peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A), receptors (Axl receptor tyrosine kinase, CRIM-1), proteases (cathepsins A and B, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, serine protease 23, legumain), and protease inhibitors (elafin, Kunitz-type proteinase inhibitor 2).
PMC2493375	D05001	Hence it is not surprising that MMPI clinical trials to inhibit MMP-directed cleavage of basement membrane proteins to prevent metastasis were unsuccessful: even with a current understanding of the expansive matrix metalloproteinase signaling degradome, it would be impossible to predict the wide range of proteins and pathways that are affected by the MMPI drug.
PMC2493375	D05005	The potential role of matrix metalloproteinase processing in these functions is currently under study.
PMC2493375	D06000	Proteases are not only responsible for protein degradation but, by limited and specific cleavages, can act as switches, turning protein activity on or off, or they can modulate protein function in more complex ways.
PMC2493375	D06002	For example, matrix metalloproteinase cleavage of just four amino terminal residues of chemokines that are expressed in inflammation converts agonists to antagonists (77), activates other chemokines (131), converts CXCL12 to a neurotoxin that switches receptor specificity (145), and sheds cell membrane-bound fractalkine (26).
PMC2493375	D07003	DJ-1 contains a putative active site similar to that of cysteine proteases, though the catalytic triad is orientated unfavorably, with C-terminal helix 9 blocking the putative catalytic site (53), and only a weak activity against a fluorogenic casein substrate has been reported (86).
PMC2493375	D08000	Neuron-specific (gamma) enolase is expressed in breast carcinomas (47) and is a serum and cerebrospinal fluid marker for neurological damage (115).
PMC2493375	D08001	The neurotrophic and neuroprotective activities of neuron-specific enolase lie in the C-terminal 30 residues (44), and these functions could be modified by the matrix metalloproteinase processing reported here.
PMC2493375	D08003	This molecule contains within its sequence granulins 1 to 7, 6-kDa peptides released by elastase proteolysis, which have independent functions, for example promoting proliferation and inflammation (45).
PMC2493375	D09000	Targeting a protease might have unexpected positive or negative influences on a disease course, depending upon whether the enzyme is a drug target or an antitarget (92).
PMC2493375	D09002	Thus, MMP-8 became the first matrix metalloproteinase antitarget in cancer therapy research (6).
PMC2493375	D09006	Inhibiting shedding of other molecules may be beneficial; e.g., beta-2-microglobulin is a component of the major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) complex, which may be shed by tumor cells (though probably not by direct processing, since it was not a matrix metalloproteinase substrate in vitro) to prevent recognition of tumor antigens by CD8+ T cells, thus escaping immune detection (1, 105).
PMC2493375	D10000	It is clear that the substrate degradome of MMPs and other proteases must be defined during the validation of proteases as drug targets, to aid in the decision to treat disease using antiprotease drugs.
PMC2493375	D10001	Certainly, this could help to predict and minimize the side effects caused by long-term antiprotease drug administration to patients and so also aid in medicinal chemistry modification of drug leads during drug development.
PMC2493375	D10002	Since matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors are not yet specific for a single matrix metalloproteinase and since the blanket inhibition of MMPs is almost certain to cause side effects due to the many substrates, each with particular biological functions, it makes sense to target particular substrates of MMPs whose function is critical for tumorigenesis or metastasis.
PMC2493375	D10003	This requires a concerted effort at matrix metalloproteinase substrate discovery using degradomic studies which will be invaluable for the development of specific and effective anticancer drugs.

PMC2493375	I00000	The membrane type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-14) is a member of the matrix metalloproteinase family of zinc-dependent endoproteinases that are important in cancer (31, 92), consisting of 23 members in humans, 6 of which (including MMP-14) are membrane anchored (50, 122).
PMC2493375	I00001	The MMPs are one of four families of the metzincin clan, which includes ADAM (a disintegrin-like and metalloprotease domain) and ADAM with thrombospondin type 1 motifs (ADAM-TS) extracellular proteases (40).
PMC2493375	I00005	However, these proteases are now known to process a plethora of bioactive molecules (chemokines, cytokines, growth factors and their binding proteins, receptors, protease inhibitors, and cell adhesion molecules) (17, 75, 94), regulating processes involved in development (95) and normal cellular and extracellular homeostasis (88), as well as pathological processes such as inflammation and cancer (31, 41, 76, 91, 97, 122).
PMC2493375	I00009	Hence, high-throughput nonbiased techniques to uncover novel substrates that might reveal new functional roles for matrix metalloproteinase processing in physiological and pathological processes are required (90).
PMC2493375	I01000	Despite the fact that a large number of phase III clinical trials of small-molecule and peptidic matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (MMPI) were reached, these inhibitors were unsuccessful in treating cancer and arthritis, with some patients experiencing adverse side effects including tendonitis and myalgia (11, 22, 92, 93, 149).
PMC2493375	I01006	For example, in rodents, there are more than 80 additional protease genes (102), a major class of enzyme drug targets (69, 92), many of which are expressed in host defense cells.
PMC2493375	I02000	Proteomics offers new high-content techniques for protease substrate discovery in complex cellular systems, as we have demonstrated previously using isotope-coded affinity tag (ICAT) labeling and tandem mass spectrometry (MS-MS) (25, 129) and isotope tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) labeling (26).
PMC2493375	I02003	ICAT is used for quantitative comparison of the proteins in two samples labeled with a heavy or light label, for example, protease versus null or inactive protease (25, 129) or drug- versus vehicle-treated cells.
PMC2493375	I03001	To investigate proteolysis in a cellular environment, protease inhibitors or RNA interference experiments can also be utilized to reduce the activity of a particular protease and thereby identify substrates which accumulate while providing information useful for drug development (14).
PMC2493375	I03005	This proteomics approach describes a complex dynamic environment of basal proteolytic shedding from the plasma membrane and pericellular matrix by using metalloproteinase activity.
PMC2493375	R00000	To gain further insight into the substrate degradome of MMP-14, we utilized the MMPI prinomastat to block metalloproteinase protein processing and ectodomain shedding in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells transfected with MMP-14.
PMC2493375	R01000	A largely unresolved concern of the unsuccessful MMPI clinical trials has been whether the matrix metalloproteinase drug targets were effectively dosed, i.e., were inhibitor concentrations systemically attained and available for a sufficient time (22)?
PMC2493375	R02005	S1D in the supplemental material) in this system with prinomastat treatment, whereas treatment with 1,10-phenanthroline, a zinc chelator and nonspecific inhibitor of metalloproteinases, was toxic at concentrations of ≥0.1
PMC2493375	R02007	Thus, the changes in ICAT ratios between MMPI and vehicle were due to metalloproteinase inhibitory effects and not due to drug-induced alterations in cell proliferation, apoptosis, or toxicity to the MDA-MB-231 cells.
PMC2493375	R04001	We hypothesized that levels of matrix metalloproteinase substrates and binding partners would change in MDA-MB-231 cell transfectants in the presence of the MMPI due to reduced processing, shedding, and clearance (Fig.
PMC2493375	R06000	To validate the analysis of MMPI effects as a pharmacoproteomic confirmation of a degradomic substrate screen, we looked for evidence of reduced processing, shedding, and clearance of known matrix metalloproteinase substrates.
PMC2493375	R06001	Twenty-nine known matrix metalloproteinase substrates were identified.
PMC2493375	R07000	Eleven of these established matrix metalloproteinase substrates are known to be processed by MMP-14 (Table ​(Table2,2, references).
PMC2493375	R07001	For the other 18, cleavage by MMP-14 has not been reported, but based on the redundancy of processing by the matrix metalloproteinase family, it is likely that many of these are MMP-14 substrates.
PMC2493375	R07005	Follistatin-related protein 1, cystatin C, and GROα, however, were not processed by MMP-14 in vitro (data not shown), suggesting that these ICAT ratios were lowered due to indirect effects of the MMPI, inhibition of other active metalloproteases expressed by these cells, or binding to MMP-14 exosites or suggesting that essential proteins or interactions present in the cellular context are not reproduced in the biochemical assays.
PMC2493375	R08000	The quest for MMPIs has yet to reveal any which are 100% specific for an individual matrix metalloproteinase (22, 92, 93).
PMC2493375	R08001	Prinomastat potently inhibits MMP-14, as well as the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9 and MMP-3 and MMP-13 (Ki values, 30 to 300 pM), but weakly inhibits MMP-1 and MMP-7 (see Fig.
PMC2493375	R08003	Using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) (83) and microarray analysis (C. J. Morrison and C. M. Overall, unpublished data), we found that MDA-MB-231 cells expressed several MMPs at the RNA level, although no soluble matrix metalloproteinase activity was detected previously by using a peptide substrate-based assay (129).
PMC2493375	R08012	However, the possibility that MMPs or metalloproteinases, such as ADAM-10, that are inhibited by prinomastat could contribute to substrate cleavage in vivo cannot be discounted.
PMC2493375	R09003	Significantly, many of these proteins, including seven that are known matrix metalloproteinase substrates, had reduced ICAT ratios when the MMP-14-transfected cells were incubated with the MMPI compared with those of the vehicle (Table ​(Table3;3; also see Table S6A in the supplemental material, MMPI/vehicle).
PMC2493375	R11000	We chose several proteins for in vitro validation by cleavage assays to determine whether the shedding was direct, that is, due to MMP-14 cleavage of the proteins themselves or due to indirect effects or other proteases.
PMC2493375	R11010	Iduronate-2-sulfatase, which participates in glycosaminoglycan metabolism and a deficiency of which manifests as the lysosomal storage disorder Hunter disease (54), was processed from an apparent molecular mass of 97 kDa to fragments of 57.5 kDa and 31.6 kDa by MMP-14 (Fig. ​(Fig.3E).3E).
PMC2493375	R11013	Iduronate-2-sulfatase was also processed, at higher efficiency, by MMP-2 and MMP-8 (see Fig.
PMC2493375	R12002	Although the MMPI/vehicle ICAT ratios of the protease inhibitors elafin, Kunitz-type protease inhibitor 1, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP-1) were decreased, the elafin and Kunitz-type protease inhibitor 1 proteins were not significantly cleaved by MMPs in vitro (data not shown), and TIMP-1 is a specific matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, though it does not inhibit MMP-14 (141).
PMC2493375	R13002	These included single-pass type I and type II membrane proteins (e.g., Axl receptor tyrosine kinase and catechol-O-methyltransferase), multipass membrane proteins (e.g., chloride intracellular channel protein 1, SERCA2), and glycophosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (e.g., CD59 and uPAR) for which a direct shedding activity can be visualized.
PMC2493375	R14000	Western blotting was carried out to confirm the ICAT ratios and to validate the MMPI-dependent reduction in shedding of Axl receptor tyrosine kinase and CD59 (Fig. ​(Fig.4).4).
PMC2493375	R14001	The amount of the 68.2-kDa (apparent molecular mass) ectodomain of Axl receptor tyrosine kinase, a receptor for Gas6 which stimulates cell proliferation (78), in the conditioned medium was reduced in the presence of the MMPI, consistent with the ICAT MMPI/vehicle ratio of 0.24 (Fig. ​(Fig.4A).4A).
PMC2493375	R14004	Shedding of these two membrane proteins was enhanced by the treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, which is known to upregulate cell surface expression of various proteases, including MMP-14 (71) (Fig. 4C and D), consistent with the MMP-14-transfected cell results.
PMC2493375	R15005	We tested peptides encompassing the D3 domain juxtamembrane C-terminal peptide (272NHPDLDVQYRSG283) or the known matrix metalloproteinase cleavage site between D1 and D2 (81SGRAVTYSRSRYLEC95) as a control for cleavage to determine whether MMPs might shed suPAR.
PMC2493375	R15011	Although matrix metalloproteinase exosite interactions with sites present in the uPAR protein or interactions with other binding proteins might be required for cleavage, the peptide cleavage data suggest that neither MMP-14 nor MMP-1, -2, -8, or -9 directly shed suPAR.
PMC2493375	R16000	Identification of such a large number of known matrix metalloproteinase substrates in the conditioned medium (Table ​(Table2)2) reveals the dynamic nature of cell surface proteolysis and indicates that the administration of an MMPI enables a successful degradomic screen that can reveal substrates, both known and novel.
PMC2493375	R16001	In particular, the blockade of metalloproteinase cleavage, shown by the reversal of the ICAT ratios obtained for MMP-14/vector (no MMPI) compared with those of MMPI/vehicle (Table ​(Table3),3), demonstrates that the combined analysis of cells, ICAT labeling, and MS-MS in the absence of inhibitor and then following inhibitor treatment can be used reliably to identify proteolysis-related changes in the proteome.
PMC2493375	R16003	Therefore, a number of proteins which exhibited MMPI/vehicle ratios of ≤0.77 in the conditioned medium, i.e., within the range observed for known matrix metalloproteinase substrates, were also selected for validation that might be novel substrates of MMP-14 (Table ​(Table55 shows selected proteins; Table S8 in the supplemental material for a complete list of individual peptides and ICAT ratios for these proteins).
PMC2493375	R17002	At a 1:500 enzyme/substrate molar ratio, most of the GST-DJ-1 fusion protein was converted from an apparent molecular mass of 54.9 kDa to N-terminal fragments of 40.7, 33.9, 25.7, and 23.4 kDa, composed of the glutathione S-transferase and N-terminal portions of DJ-1, and C-terminal DJ-1
PMC2493375	R17006	The large digestion products (40.7 to 23.4 kDa) were N-terminal fragments commencing with MSPIL, the N terminus of glutathione S-transferase.
PMC2493375	R17007	Since glutathione S-transferase is 26.4 kDa, MMP-14 cleavage occurred at more than two sites within DJ-1.
PMC2493375	R18003	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase A (PPI-A, also termed cyclophilin A) is an intracellular molecular chaperone that, when secreted, functions as a proinflammatory cytokine, signaling via CD147 (EMMPRIN) and activating endothelial cells (55, 144).
PMC2493375	R18007	Gamma enolase (neuron-specific enolase), the γγ form of the glycolytic enzyme enolase (57), was proteolyzed by MMP-14, but cleavage products (ranging from apparent molecular masses of 49.0 to 33.9 kDa) were faint and disappeared at higher MMP-14 concentrations, suggestive of complete degradation (Fig. ​(Fig.6E).6E).
PMC2493375	R18010	The connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), cysteine rich protein (Cyr61), and nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV) gene (CCN) family (99) includes CTGF, a known matrix metalloproteinase substrate (25, 43).
PMC2493375	R18014	Progranulin is a multifunctional glycoprotein involved in development, tumorigenesis, inflammation, and repair that contains granulins 1 to 7, which are released by proteolysis by elastase (45).
PMC2518410	A00000	Matriptase, a type 2 transmembrane serine protease, is predominately expressed by epithelial and carcinoma cells in which hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor 1 (HAI-1), a membrane-bound, Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitor, is also expressed.
PMC2518410	A00001	HAI-1 plays dual roles in the regulation of matriptase, as a conventional protease inhibitor and as a factor required for zymogen activation of matriptase.
PMC2518410	A00002	As a consequence, activation of matriptase is immediately followed by HAI-1-mediated inhibition, with the activated matriptase being sequestered into HAI-1 complexes.
PMC2518410	A00003	Matriptase is also expressed by peripheral blood leukocytes, such as monocytes and macrophages; however, in contrast to epithelial cells, monocytes and macrophages were reported not to express HAI-1, suggesting that these leukocytes possess alternate, HAI-1-independent mechanisms regulating the zymogen activation and protease inhibition of matriptase.
PMC2518410	A00004	In the present study, we characterized matriptase complexes of 110 kDa in human milk, which contained no HAI-1 and resisted dissociation in boiling SDS in the absence of reducing agents.
PMC2518410	A00006	Proteomic and immunological methods identified the 45-kDa fragment as the noncatalytic domains of matriptase and the 80-kDa fragment as the matriptase serine protease domain covalently linked to one of three different secreted serpin inhibitors: antithrombin III, α1-antitrypsin, and α2-antiplasmin.
PMC2518410	A00007	Identification of matriptase-serpin inhibitor complexes provides evidence for the first time that the proteolytic activity of matriptase, from those cells that express no or low levels of HAI-1, may be controlled by secreted serpins.
PMC2518410	D00000	The identification of matriptase complexed with secreted serpins, particularly ATIII and α1AT, in human milk provides evidence that free, active matriptase indeed exists extracellularly either on the cell surface or in the interstitial space of lactating mammary glands, where free, active matriptase encounters these secreted serpins.
PMC2518410	D00001	As a membrane-bound serine protease with a single-pass transmembrane domain, the bulk of the matriptase molecule, including its serine protease domain, has been believed to orient itself toward the extracellular side and to function as a protease activator on the cell surface to activate substrates extracellularly (17).
PMC2518410	D00002	However, the dual roles of HAI-1 as a conventional protease inhibitor for matriptase (1) and as a factor required for zymogen activation of the protease (27) would seem to dictate that free, active matriptase is only likely to exist for a very short time.
PMC2518410	D00003	Activated matriptase has been consistently detected in complexes with HAI-1 regardless of the cell source, such as breast cancer cells vs. immortal mammary epithelial cells (2), regardless of the mode of zymogen activation, such as the constitutive activation exhibited by breast cancer cells (2) compared with the induced zymogen activation in immortal mammary epithelial cells by sphingosine 1-phosphate (2), or in prostate cancer cells by androgen (13), or more broadly in other cell types by suramin (16).
PMC2518410	D00004	Although it has been challenging to determine the exact cellular locations where the activation of matriptase occurs, it seems likely that it takes place either at the plasma membrane or in the secretory pathway during its trafficking toward the plasma membrane because activated matriptase was previously detected at cell-cell junctions (2, 8) and in vesicle-like structures within cells (16).
PMC2518410	D00005	In either case, given that HAI-1 participates in the activation process and is therefore present and able to immediately bind to the newly activated enzyme, the accessibility of free, active matriptase to its potential extracellular substrates, or to protease inhibitors other than HAI-1, may be very limited.
PMC2518410	D00006	Therefore, in matriptase-expressing cells that also express a comparable amount of HAI-1, free, active matriptase may never reach the extracellular environment at meaningful levels.
PMC2518410	D00007	It is, therefore, paradoxical that, in the present study, we purified matriptase complexed with secreted serpins from human milk.
PMC2518410	D00009	Furthermore, serpins are activated after secretion, and, therefore, it is unlikely that inhibition and formation of matriptase-serpin complexes occur in the secretory pathway.
PMC2518410	D00010	Therefore, free, active matriptase has to reach the extracellular environment, at least on the extracellular surface of the plasma membrane, for exposure to these secreted serpin-type serine protease inhibitors.
PMC2518410	D01000	Mammary epithelial cells produce most milk proteins, and, since milk-derived, immortal mammary epithelial cells express both matriptase and HAI-1, the milk-derived matriptase-HAI-1 complexes are very likely produced by mammary epithelial cells (17).
PMC2518410	D01001	Robust zymogen activation of matriptase apparently takes places in these mammary epithelial cells during lactation since a large amount of matriptase-HAI-1 complexes are present in milk (Fig.
PMC2518410	D01003	Since the activated matriptase produced by mammary epithelial cells is sequestered in HAI-1 complexes and in light of the stability of HAI-1/matriptase complexes, it seems very unlikely that the activated matriptase in serpin complexes is derived from matriptase liberated from HAI-1 complexes, being inhibited by and forming complexes with these three serpins.
PMC2518410	D01004	This possibility is made more unlikely by the facts that 1) the pH of milk does not favor the dissociation of matriptase-HAI-1 complexes, 2) no free HAI-1 was detected in milk as would be expected if the serpin-bound matriptase was derived from HAI-1 complexes (Figs. 1 and 8), and 3) free α2AP was undetectable in milk and is however found in complexes with matriptase (Fig. 5).
PMC2518410	D01005	Furthermore, there is probably much more free α1AT than free ATIII in human milk (20), yet the levels of matriptase-ATIII complexes are apparently higher than those of α1AT complexes in human milk.
PMC2518410	D01006	Had matriptase been dissociated from HAI-1 complexes in milk, one would expect α1AT to have a quantitative advantage in forming complexes with matriptase compared with ATIII due to the large amount of free α1AT.
PMC2518410	D01007	These observations suggest that there are complicated biological processes behind the formation of these matriptase-serpin complexes regarding the cell types that express matriptase and where the active matriptase encounters these serpins.
PMC2518410	D02000	The activated matriptase found in these serpin-complexes could be produced by cell types other than mammary epithelial cells.
PMC2518410	D02002	Among all these cell types, migrating leukocytes are a potential source of free active matriptase for what could subsequently be inhibited by ATIII and α1AT.
PMC2518410	D02003	Peritoneal macrophages have been reported to express matriptase but not HAI-1 (4).
PMC2518410	D02004	THP-1 human monocytic cells express matriptase and very low levels of HAI-1 (Fig. 6).
PMC2518410	D02005	In the absence of HAI-1, migrating macrophages may secret free active matriptase.
PMC2518410	D02009	Therefore, an appealing hypothesis for the presence of both free and matriptase-complexed ATIII and α1AT in human milk is that matriptase is activated in migrating leukocytes and/or plasma cells when these cells are extravasating and migrating through the basement membrane of capillaries in the lactating mammary gland, where both serpins are deposited.
PMC2518410	D03000	The biology of the inhibition of matriptase by α2AP may be different from the other two secreted serpins since free α2AP was not detected in human milk by immunoblot analysis (Fig.
PMC2518410	D03003	The presence of matriptase-α2AP complexes in the absence of free α2AP in human milk suggests that α2AP may be expressed by the same cells that are expressing and activating matriptase, resulting in the formation of α2AP complexes before shedding into the extracellular milieu, in a fashion similar to HAI-1.
PMC2518410	D04003	In the case of the 110-kDa matriptase-serpin complexes, the covalent linkage between the reactive centers of the serpins and active site triad serine of matriptase held both proteins together under boiled and nonreduced conditions (Fig. 2).
PMC2518410	D04004	The binding, inhibition, and trapping of serine proteases by serpins likely significantly disrupts the active site triad and substrate binding pocket of proteases since the activation-associated epitope recognized by the mAb M69 is no longer present on the 110-kDa complexes (Figs. 2 and ​and55).
PMC2518410	D05000	In summary, in this study, we have purified three novel matriptase complexes containing secreted serpins.
PMC2518410	D05001	These secreted serpins may provide the long-sought answer for the question as to how the proteolytic activity of matriptase is controlled in those cells that express no or very low levels of HAI-1.
PMC2518410	D05002	In addition, the presence of free, active matriptase in the extracellular milieu and the formation of matriptase-serpin complexes suggest that these serpins could be useful tools to detect active matriptase in those cells that express very low levels of or no HAI-1.
PMC2518410	D05003	Despite their common ability to inhibit matriptase, secreted serpins, at least for ATIII and α1AT, are likely to be responsible to the control of active matriptase possibly produced by migrating leukocytes in contrast to HAI-1, which regulates matriptase in mammary epithelial cells.

PMC2518410	F27002	Matriptase inhibition by hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor-1 is essential for placental development.
PMC2518410	I00000	matriptase (also known as MT-SP1, TADG15, ST-14, and epithin) and hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor 1 (HAI-1) are a cognate pair of epithelium-derived, membrane-bound, serine protease, and Kunitz-type serine protease inhibitors (12, 17, 18, 30, 32).
PMC2518410	I00001	The functional relationship between matriptase and HAI-1 was initially recognized by the purification of matriptase-HAI-1 complexes from human milk (17).
PMC2518410	I00003	Subsequently, concordant expression of matriptase and HAI-1 was seen in human breast and ovarian cancer cell lines (23).
PMC2518410	I00005	More recently, significant expression correlation between matriptase and HAI-1 at the RNA level was further emphasized by a transcriptional profiling study with the use of microarray data from 2,000 human normal and cancerous samples, including tumor samples from 18 different tissue types, 59 cancer-derived cell lines, and 86 types of nonpathogenic tissues (4).
PMC2518410	I01000	In addition to this expression correlation and the formation of complexes in vivo and in vitro, an intimate functional linkage between matriptase and HAI-1 was clearly demonstrated during embryonic development and the tumorigenesis of epithelial cells (29).
PMC2518410	I01001	Matriptase and HAI-1 are coexpressed in chorionic trophoblasts during early development of the mouse placenta.
PMC2518410	I01003	Genetic ablation of matriptase in HAI-1-deficient mouse embryos corrects the impaired processes of placentation caused by HAI-1 ablation (29).
PMC2518410	I01004	Therefore, coexpression of HAI-1 and matriptase is not required for placental development.
PMC2518410	I01005	However, HAI-1 must be expressed if matriptase is expressed, but placentation proceeds normally in embryos lacking both HAI-1 and matriptase.
PMC2518410	I01006	The close functional relationship between matriptase and HAI-1 is also observed in the skin of zebrafish (5).
PMC2518410	I01007	The loss of epithelial integrity in the HAI-1-deficient zebrafish epidermis can be rescued by simultaneous inactivation of matriptase.
PMC2518410	I01008	The functional linkage between matriptase and HAI-1 also has important implications for the development of cancer.
PMC2518410	I01009	Matriptase activity that is only partially opposed by endogenous HAI-1 causes increased carcinogen sensitivity and produces spontaneous tumorigenesis in the skin of keratin-5-matriptase transgenic mice (21).
PMC2518410	I01012	Enforced expression of matriptase in breast cancer cell lines that do not naturally express the enzyme only results in the production of significant amounts of protein when HAI-1 is coexpressed (24, 27).
PMC2518410	I01013	In the absence of functional HAI-1, matriptase is only produced at very low levels and fails to traffic out of the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus (24).
PMC2518410	I01014	In breast cancer cells that express both proteins, reducing expression of HAI-1 by small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated HAI-1 knockdown resulted in spontaneous zymogen activation of matriptase and significantly enhanced the zymogen activation of matriptase induced by sphingosine 1-phosphate (24).
PMC2518410	I01015	Unexpectedly, HAI-1 is required for matriptase activation (27), and, as a consequence, zymogen activation of matriptase is immediately followed by HAI-1-mediated inhibition of the active matriptase.
PMC2518410	I01016	Consistent with the dual roles of HAI-1 as a conventional protease inhibitor and as a cofactor for matriptase zymogen activation, activated matriptase has been consistently detected in HAI-1 complexes (3, 14).
PMC2518410	I02000	In light of the pivotal role of HAI-1 in the expression, zymogen activation, and inhibition of matriptase and in light of the data from the animal models, it is perhaps not surprising that a growing body of evidence shows that the tight expression correlation and close functional linkage of matriptase and HAI-1 may be altered or lost during the progression of human ovarian cancer.
PMC2518410	I02001	Both matriptase and HAI-1 are expressed by ovarian surface epithelial cells (25).
PMC2518410	I02002	However, expression of matriptase in the absence of HAI-1 or with very low levels of HAI-1 was observed in primary human ovarian carcinomas, particularly in advanced disease (25).
PMC2518410	I02003	Similar imbalances between matriptase and HAI-1 expression have been noted in other cancers of epithelial origin, particularly in the context of more advanced or aggressive disease, suggesting that this imbalance may play a significant role in carcinogenesis and tumor progression (28).
PMC2518410	I03000	It is, therefore, surprising that there are some normal cell types that have been reported to express matriptase in the absence of HAI-1.
PMC2518410	I03001	Matriptase messenger RNA (mRNA) has been detected in peripheral blood leukocytes (30).
PMC2518410	I03002	The THP-1 human monocytic cell line has been reported to express matriptase but no HAI-1 (11).
PMC2518410	I03003	Matriptase mRNA is present in mouse peritoneal macrophages but not in bone marrow macrophages; however, HAI-1 is not detectable in macrophages of either type (4).
PMC2518410	I03004	These data and the finding that some tumors of epithelial origin apparently express matriptase in the absence of HAI-1 suggest that there must be a HAI-1-independent mechanism at work that can facilitate the expression, trafficking, activation, and inhibition of matriptase in these cells.
PMC2518410	I03005	HAI-1-independent matriptase expression by cells may lead to the release of active, non-HAI-1-complexed matriptase.
PMC2518410	I04000	In the present study, we identified novel matriptase-containing complexes in human milk that contain no HAI-1.
PMC2518410	I04002	The existence of these matriptase-serpin complexes in human milk suggests that serpins may play an important role in regulating the activity of matriptase, particularly in the context of cell types that express matriptase in the absence of measurable HAI-1.
PMC2518410	R00000	During lactation, mammary epithelial cells robustly activate matriptase immediately followed by HAI-1-mediated inhibition of active matriptase and the shedding into the milk of matriptase-HAI-1 complexes with a size of 95 kDa (17).
PMC2518410	R00001	Although the physiological role of matriptase zymogen activation during lactation remains to be determined, human milk is apparently one of the best systems in which to characterize the diverse roles of this type 2 transmembrane serine protease.
PMC2518410	R00002	When human milk was fractionated by CM-Sepharose chromatography, minor matriptase complexes with an apparent mass of 110 kDa were eluted and partially separated in different column fractions (Fig.
PMC2518410	R00003	1A, fractions 18 through 24) from the majority of the matriptase detected in 95-kDa complexes (Fig.
PMC2518410	R00005	The 95-kDa matriptase protein bands were further confirmed to be HAI-1 complexes by blotting with the HAI-1 mAb M19 (Fig. 1B), consistent with our previous study (17).
PMC2518410	R00006	In contrast, the minor 110-kDa matriptase-containing complexes apparently do not contain HAI-1 since they were not detected by the HAI-1 mAb M19 (Fig. 1B).
PMC2518410	R01000	To characterize and compare the novel 110-kDa matriptase-containing complexes with the matriptase-HAI-1 complexes, fractions containing roughly equal amounts of both 95-kDa HAI-1 complexes and 110-kDa complexes (such as fraction 21 in Fig. 1 and Fig.
PMC2518410	R01001	2A, lane 1) were subjected to immunoprecipitation experiments with the use of immobilized matriptase and HAI-1 mAbs (Fig. 2A).
PMC2518410	R01002	When both the 95-kDa and 110-kDa complexes were incubated with immobilized matriptase mAb 21-9 on Sepharose beads (18), both complexes bound efficiently to the beads and were immunodepleted from the solution (Fig.
PMC2518410	R01003	2A, lane 2), confirming that both complexes contain matriptase.
PMC2518410	R01007	In addition to the matriptase mAbs M32 and 21-9 and the HAI-1 mAb M19, we have developed unique mAbs that can distinguish the latent from the activated form of matriptase (1).
PMC2518410	R01008	These activated matriptase-specific mAbs have been used in our previous studies for the characterization of matriptase activation in vivo and in vitro (1, 2, 8, 13, 14, 16).
PMC2518410	R01009	When both the 110-kDa and 95-kDa matriptase complexes were incubated with Sepharose beads linked to the activated matriptase-specific mAb M69, only 95-kDa matriptase-HAI-1 complexes and not the 110-kDa complexes were immunodepleted from the solution (Fig.
PMC2518410	R01014	Analysis of these eluates demonstrated that the 95-kDa matriptase-HAI-1 complexes were liberated from the beads as both the original 95-kDa complex and as a 70-kDa band size expected for uncomplexed matriptase (Fig.
PMC2518410	R01015	2A, lanes 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, and 10), consistent with the features of a Kunitz inhibitor of HAI-1, which shows acid sensitivity and reversible binding and inhibition to matriptase (1).
PMC2518410	R01016	The 110-kDa complexes were also eluted from the matriptase mAb 21-9-Sepharose (Fig.
PMC2518410	R01020	The differential binding of both matriptase-containing complexes to the HAI-1 mAb not only demonstrates the novelty of the 110-kDa matriptase-containing complexes but also provides the biochemical means for the separation and purification of the novel matriptase-containing complexes from the predominant HAI-1-containing complexes.
PMC2518410	R02000	We further purified the novel matriptase-containing complexes from the 110-kDa complex-enriched CM-Sepharose column fractions by using a matriptase mAb 21-9-Sepharose immunoaffinity column after removal of the matriptase-HAI-1 complexes with an immobilized HAI-1 mAb M19 immunoaffinity column (Fig. 2B).
PMC2518410	R02001	The fractions eluted from the matriptase-immunoaffinity column were analyzed by a one-dimensional SDS PAGE under both nonboiled and boiled conditions (Fig. 2B) and then a two-dimensional, diagonal gel electrophoresis under reducing conditions (Fig. 3).
PMC2518410	R03002	Tryptic fragments derived from this protein band contain five peptides matched to matriptase, 30 peptides matched to ATIII, three peptides matched to α1AT, and two matched to α2AP.
PMC2518410	R03003	Eleven tryptic peptides derived from the 45-kDa protein bands were matched to matriptase (Fig. 3).
PMC2518410	R03004	Interestingly, the five tryptic peptides derived from the 80-kDa bands, which matched to matriptase, were all located within the serine protease domain of matriptase, whereas, the matriptase-matching tryptic peptides from the 45-kDa bands were all localized in the noncatalytic domains of matriptase.
PMC2518410	R03005	These data suggest that the 110-kDa complexes contain disulfide-linked, two-chain, activated matriptase.
PMC2518410	R03006	Considering the molecular mass of the three serpins identified (∼55 kDa for ATIII, ∼60 kDa for α1AT, and ∼70 kDa for α2AP) and of the serine protease domain of matriptase (25 kDa), it seems very likely that the 80-kDa bands are composed of three different complexes of the matriptase serine protease domain with one or other of these three serpins.
PMC2518410	R04000	We further confirmed that the 110-kDa matriptase complexes are a mixture of matriptase associated with each of the three secreted serpins by immunoblot with ATIII, α1AT, and α2AP polyclonal antibodies and the matriptase mAb M32 (Fig. 4).
PMC2518410	R04002	The 110-kDa complexes were recognized by the matriptase mAb M32 and all three serpin polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 4, A–D, lane 1).
PMC2518410	R04003	The matriptase mAb M32 did not interact with these three serpin proteins (Fig. 4A, lanes 2, 3, and 4); the serpin polyclonal antibodies only interacted with their corresponding proteins and not the other serpins (Fig. 4, B–D, lanes 2, 3, and 4).
PMC2518410	R05001	This unique feature of serpin-type inhibitors is consistent with the resistance to dissociation by boiling SDS in the absence of reducing agents exhibited by the 110-kDa matriptase-serpin complexes (Fig. 2).
PMC2518410	R05002	Interestingly, chemical reduction of the 110-kDa matriptase-serpin complexes cleaved the disulfide-linkage between the serine protease domain and noncatalytic domain of matriptase in the complexes and resulted in the release of the noncatalytic domains of matriptase, seen as the 45-kDa protein band in the diagonal gel electrophoresis study (Fig. 3).
PMC2518410	R05003	After releasing the 45-kDa matriptase noncatalytic domain, the 110-kDa complexes were converted into 80-kDa complexes consisting of the matriptase serine protease domain covalently linked with either ATIII, α1AT, or α2AP.
PMC2518410	R06000	We further analyzed the expression status of matriptase and its endogenous inhibitors, including HAI-1, ATIII, α1AT, and α2AP in defatted human milk (Fig. 5).
PMC2518410	R06001	Matriptase was detected predominantly in its 95-kDa HAI-1 complexes and also as a minor species at 110-kDa, which may represent a mixture of matriptase complexes with the individual secreted serpins (Fig. 5, lane 1).
PMC2518410	R06002	There was no free (noncomplexed) matriptase, either in its latent or activated form, detected in human milk.
PMC2518410	R06003	The activated matriptase-specific mAb M69, only detected the 95-kDa matriptase-HAI-1 complexes (Fig. 5, lane 2), further confirmed that there was no free, active matriptase in human milk.
PMC2518410	R07000	In search of cell types that utilize different mechanisms that do not involve HAI-1 for the regulation of matriptase, we turned our attention to hemopoietic cells, some of which previously were reported to express matriptase in the absence of HAI-1 (4, 11).
PMC2518410	R07001	Western blot analysis of human leukemia and lymphoma cell lines for the expression of matriptase and HAI-1 was performed (Fig. 6).
PMC2518410	R07002	T-47D human breast cancer cells, which express high levels of both matriptase and HAI-1, were used as a control.
PMC2518410	R07003	Western blotting with the matriptase mAb M32 revealed that THP-1, human monocytic cells, and two Burkitt's lymphoma cells, Daudi and ST486, were positive for the protease, whereas the seven others were negative (Fig. 6).
PMC2518410	R07004	Although low levels of HAI-1 were detected in some cells that express no matriptase, neither Daudi nor ST486 cell lines coexpressed HAI-1 with matriptase.
PMC2518410	R07006	These expression analyses suggest that some hematopoietic cells are likely using HAI-1 as an independent mechanism for the regulation of matriptase and that the secreted serpins identified in the present study may serve as endogenous inhibitors for matriptase derived from these hematopoietic cells.
PMC2528014	D02005	In addition, five down-regulated proteins identified in pancreatic cancer juice (carboxypeptidase A2, chymotrypsinogen B, elastase-3A, elastase-3B and trypsin-1) was also down-regulated in pancreatic cancer tissues compared with pancreatitis and normal pancreas tissues as described by Shen et al.

PMC2688184	A02001	Six proteins were already described RA antigens: heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1, aldolase, α-enolase, calreticulin, 60 kDa heat shock protein (HSP60) and BiP. Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 and the far upstream element-binding proteins (FUSE-BP) 1 and 2 were identified as new antigens.
PMC2688184	A02002	Post-translational protein modifications were analyzed and potentially deiminated peptides were found on aldolase, α-enolase, PGK1, calreticulin, HSP60 and the FUSE-BPs.
PMC2688184	D01001	Six of these proteins corresponded to already-described RA antigens – heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 [26,27], aldolase [28], α-enolase [29], calreticulin
PMC2688184	D01005	A detailed analysis of MS spectra enabled us to show that seven of these antigens contain potentially deiminated peptides: aldolase, α-enolase, PGK1, calreticulin, HSP60, FUSE-BP1 and FUSE-BP2.
PMC2688184	D01006	Western blot analysis confirmed the presence of such residues in aldolase, α-enolase, HSP60 and FUSE-BP1 and confirmed the ability of another autoantigen, PGK1, to be citrullinated in vitro.
PMC2688184	D02001	These data led us to analyze the reactivity against noncitrullinated peptides and citrullinated peptides derived from the different proteins, and our interest was focused on two peptides derived from α-enolase and FUSE-BP with the hypothesis that these two citrullinated peptides may represent new antigenic determinants.
PMC2688184	D02002	Firstly, the reactivity of RA sera against the α-enolase peptide selected by MALDI-TOF data is not related to citrullination.
PMC2688184	D02003	This result is not surprising since this peptide (YNQLLRcitrIEEELGSKAK) is not an immunodominant citrullinated epitope recognized by autoAb directed against citrullinated α-enolase.
PMC2688184	D02004	Indeed, in a recent report Lundberg and colleagues have demonstrated that the RA antibody response to human citrullinated α-enolase is directed against an immunodominant peptide (peptide 1A), different from that identified in the present study and one that cross-reacts with that recognizing Porphyromonas gingivalis enolase
PMC2688184	D04002	Indeed, aldolase and α-enolase have been already described as autoantigens in RA [28,29]; and in the K/BxN mouse model, arthritis is induced by pathogenic autoAb directed against another glycolytic enzyme, the glucose-6-phosphate isomerase [40].
PMC2688184	D04003	The role of citrullination in the recognition of α-enolase by RA patient-derived autoAb has been reported [10].
PMC2688184	D04004	In addition, our study indicates that both aldolase and PGK1 also contain deiminated peptides, suggesting that the recognition of glycolytic enzymes by RA sera is associated with their potential to undergo this post-translational modification.
PMC2688184	D06005	Citrullination of proteins is mediated by peptidylarginine deiminase, which converts peptidylarginine into citrulline.

PMC2688184	I01006	The deimination of proteins is mediated by peptidylarginine deiminase (peptidylarginine deiminase) and occurs notably during cell death and oxidative stress [15,16], both events observed in RA synovium.
PMC2688184	R03001	We therefore identified heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1 at 33 kDa, fructose-biphosphate aldolase A (aldolase) and phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) at 39/43 kDa, α-enolase and calreticulin at 46/51 kDa, 60 kDa heat shock protein (HSP60) and stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 at 58/62 kDa, and far upstream element-binding proteins 1 and 2 (FUSE-BP1 and FUSE-BP2) and BiP, also named GRP78, at 67/70 kDa (Figure ​(Figure2b).2b).
PMC2688184	R06000	To verify experimentally the effect of citrullination upon the mass profile observed by MALDI-TOF analysis, we proceeded with the in vitro deimination of aldolase purified from rabbit muscle.
PMC2688184	R06001	Figure ​Figure33 shows the 2-DE maps of native and citrullinated aldolase, respectively.
PMC2688184	R06004	This was expressed in mass spectra whose peak scarcity was related to the isoelectric point value of citrullinated aldolase (data not shown).
PMC2688184	R07003	It is noteworthy that all these observations are valid for in vitro aldolase citrullination and can be extended to the HL-60 cell extract as well.
PMC2688184	R11000	Differentiated HL-60 cells have been previously shown to express peptidylarginine deiminase [24,25].
PMC2688184	R11002	On the replicas of these maps, several spots were consistently detected by anti-citrulline antibodies (Figure ​(Figure4a);4a); in particular, spots previously characterized as α-enolase, aldolase and, at a lower level, HSP60 and FUSE-BP2.
PMC2688184	R11003	In another set of experiments, HL-60 protein maps were incubated with peptidylarginine deiminase for one night at 37°C.
PMC2688233	A02006	Among the 21 increased protein spots, we identified 9 proteins including transitional endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (TERA), cathepsin D, and transglutaminase 2 (TG2), which increased to 4.8-fold, 1.5-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively.

PMC2713358	A00003	The first approach utilized a protease to ‘shave’ surface-exposed peptides from the bacterial cell surface and identify them by mass spectrometry.
PMC2713358	D00002	The first method attempted to determine surface-exposed domains of outer membrane proteins through the use of a protease to cleave off exposed peptides, an approach first successfully performed in a Gram-positive bacterium without significant cytoplasmic protein contamination by Rodriguez-Ortega and colleagues (Rodriguez-Ortega et al., 2006).
PMC2713358	D01002	The first step used was an organic solvent (60% methanol), which has been previously shown to result in the LC-MS/MS identification of more proteins than SDS-solubilized samples (Zhang et al., 2007) and can be easily removed from the sample after protease digestion.
PMC2713358	D02001	The number of contaminating cytoplasmic proteins was also significantly reduced (~22% of the proteins identified) compared to the protease ‘shaving’ method (~55% of the proteins identified).
PMC2713358	D03005	One possible improvement of these techniques might be to utilize the Sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin tag to label outer membrane proteins, cleave the surface-exposed portions of the proteins with a protease, and separate the surface-exposed peptides from the supernatant utilizing the interaction between biotin and Neutravidin.

PMC2736765	D02004	The role in renal cell function of inositol pentakisphosphate 2-kinase is incompletely understood.
PMC2736765	D02005	One major role for inositol pentakisphosphate 2-kinase has been in the regulation of mature messenger RNA nuclear export and mRNA translation arrest during cellular stress.16 Most recently, cytoplasmic inositol pentakisphosphate 2-kinase has been associated with stress granule formation.

Figure 3 shows a representative LC-MS/MS spectra used to identify the 1838.851 m/z peptide as inositol pentakisphosphate 2-kinase.

PMC2774049	D01002	The ratio between GGH, which removes terminal glutamates from methotrexate, and folylpolyglutamate synthetase, which adds glutamates to methotrexate metabolites, has been shown to effectively predict methotrexate accumulation in both myeloid and lymphoid blasts.20,21 Inhibition of GGH at the molecular level has been shown to increase methotrexate metabolites in human sarcoma cell lines as well as leukemic cell lines.22,23 Interestingly, methylation of the CpG1 and CpG2 regions in the GGH promoter was shown to significantly reduce GGH mRNA expression and GGH catalytic activity, which resulted in higher accumulation of methotrexate metabolites in acute lymphoblastic leukemic cells.19

PMC2831859	A00007	In conclusion, our data support aldose reductase and SOD2 as renal antigens of human MN and suggest that oxidative stress may drive glomerular SOD2 expression.
PMC2831859	D01003	aldose reductase and SOD2 emerged as the two major podocyte components recognized by both circulating and glomerular IgG4.
PMC2831859	D01005	Moreover, de novo expression of both aldose reductase and SOD2 and co-localization with IgG4 and C5b-9 were observed in MN biopsies while being absent in other glomerular pathologies.
PMC2831859	D01006	Ultrastructural study clearly assessed localization of aldose reductase and SOD2 in podocyte cytoplasm and foot processes and in electron-dense subepithelial immune deposits.
PMC2831859	D01007	Taken together, these findings demonstrate that aldose reductase and SOD2 are neo-expressed proteins in MN glomeruli and that both are recognized by specific circulating antibodies that can also be detected in glomerular subepithelial immune deposits.
PMC2831859	D01008	The prevalence of IgG4 in glomerular immune deposits confirms the concept of an isotype-specific deposition mechanism; therefore, aldose reductase and SOD2 should be considered glomerular antigens implicated in the immune process and actually belong, with NEP and PLA2R and with the new panel of antigens currently under investigation (G.M.G., personal observation), to the list of antigens recognized in human MN.
PMC2831859	D02002	Neo-expression of both aldose reductase and SOD2 may, in fact, represent a continuation mechanism after an initiation phase in which the basic event is deposition of anti-PLA2AR, anti-NEP, and/or other, unrecognized antibodies.
PMC2831859	D02004	A definitive explanation will mostly rely on animal models overexpressing aldose reductase and SOD2.
PMC2831859	D02005	Ongoing experiments for aldose reductase are experiencing problems and will demand more time to be set up because of a toxic effect of aldose reductase overexpression (data not shown).

PMC2831859	D03004	The enzyme also catalyzes the transformation of aldehydes, generated upon oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids.18 Localization of aldose reductase within the normal kidney is limited to tubular epithelial cells of the medulla, and it is absent in normal glomeruli.19,20
PMC2831859	D05000	The hypothesis, inferred from function of both aldose reductase and SOD2 proteins, is that their expression is modified upon oxidative stress induction.
PMC2831859	D05001	In vitro studies on immortalized human podocytes undergoing controlled oxidation by H2O2 administration showed a significant upregulation mainly of membrane SOD2 24 hours after treatment, whereas induction of aldose reductase seems less specific.

PMC2831859	R06001	Quantitative analysis of aldose reductase and SOD2 expression was assessed through IF morphometric evaluation (Figure 3, O and P).
PMC2831859	R07000	IEM for aldose reductase and SOD2 was performed in patients (n = 3) affected by stage 2 MN.
PMC2831859	R07001	These patients were selected among those with positivity for aldose reductase and SOD2 circulating antibodies.
PMC2831859	R07002	aldose reductase (Figure 4) and SOD2 (Figure 5) were expressed in the podocyte cytoplasm and along the podocyte plasma membrane (see Figure 4, C and D, for aldose reductase and Figure 5, C through E, for SOD2), whereas they were absent in nuclei (Figure 4E).
PMC2831859	R07003	Notably, several gold particles were clearly found in glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in the context of electron-dense subepithelial immune deposits (Figure 4, A and B, for aldose reductase and Figure 5, A and B, for SOD2).
PMC2831859	R07005	Overall, these results confirmed the expression of both aldose reductase and SOD2 in the cytoplasm and on plasma membrane of podocytes of patients with MN.
PMC2831859	R07006	IEM clearly indicated presence of both aldose reductase and SOD2 within subepithelial immune deposits.
PMC2831859	R08000	Confocal microscopy further confirmed IEM results and specifically indicated co-localization of aldose reductase with both IgG4 (Figure 6, A through C and p1) and C5b-9 (Figure 7, A through C and p1) and SOD2 with the same IgG4 and C5b-9 (Figures 6, D through F and p2, and ​and7,7, D through F and p2) along GBM deposits.
PMC2831859	R09001	Igs eluted from laser-captured MN glomeruli and blotted in comparable amounts (Figure 10) against whole podocyte extracts confirmed reactivity of eluted IgG4 with a panel of proteins including aldose reductase and SOD2.
PMC2831859	R09003	In the former case (Figure 8, a through e), microeluted IgG4 recognized eight bands in a range of molecular weight between 10 and 120 kD. The major two were characterized as vimentin and its fragments; besides aldose reductase and SOD that were recognized by mass spectrometry and Western blot (Figure 8, d and e), there were four bands with molecular weight of 90, 55, 40, and 9 kD, respectively.
PMC2831859	R09004	Overall and with the exception of vimentin, which is a cytoskeletal protein, aldose reductase and SOD2 concentration was comparable with the other components, supporting that they are major antigens in MN.
PMC2831859	R11000	As evidenced in the previous section, immortalized human podocyte cell line spontaneously expresses aldose reductase (Figure 1, D through F) and SOD2 (Figure 1, G through I) on plasma membrane (see also Supplemental Figure 1, A through C and E through G).
PMC2831859	R11004	Increase of aldose reductase expression on plasma membrane was not evident (Figure 11C) and was only minimally appreciable in the cytoplasm (Supplemental Figure 7).
PMC2835760	A01002	We identified phosphoglycerate kinase (PGKC), heat shock protein (HSP70), and histones H2B and H3 as possible candidate diagnostic antigens.
PMC2835760	D03003	[15] was biased by design towards abundant proteins, and the final list included mitochondrial HSP70, a ribosomal protein, a paraflagellar rod protein and two other flagellar proteins, as well as glycosomal phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase.

PMC2835760	R02005	By aligning the blots with the protein stain, we estimated that this band could either be phosphoglycerate kinase (PGKC), or another protein of similar molecular weight.
PMC2835760	R06002	Purified PGKC was available, and we expressed HSP70 as a recombinant protein, fused to glutathione S transferase (glutathione-S-transferase), and also made His-tagged histone H2B and histone H3.
PMC2842036	A00005	We find internal cleavages in plasma proteins created by endo- and exopeptidases, providing information about the activities of proteolytic enzymes in blood, which may be correlated with disease states.
PMC2842036	A00006	We also find signatures of signal peptide cleavage, coagulation and complement activation, and other known proteolytic processes, in addition to a large number of cleavages that have not been reported previously, including over 200 cleavages of blood proteins by aminopeptidases.
PMC2842036	A00007	Finally, we can identify substrates from specific proteases by exogenous addition of the protease combined with N-terminal isolation and quantitative mass spectrometry.
PMC2842036	A00008	In this way we identified proteins cleaved in human plasma by membrane-type serine protease 1, an enzyme linked to cancer progression.

PMC2842036	R00001	We have addressed this challenge by employing an engineered enzyme, called subtiligase.
PMC2842036	R00002	Subtiligase is a double mutant (S221C/ P225A) of the serine protease subtilisin BPN′ from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (7), containing additional modifications that enhance stability (8, 9).
PMC2842036	R00004	Subtiligase exhibits absolute specificity for N-terminal α-amines over lysine ϵ-amines, making it an excellent tool for N-terminal labeling.
PMC2842036	R00005	Our group has previously described a subtiligase-based method for labeling, isolation, and enrichment of protein N termini in cell lysates (10).
PMC2842036	R02003	It is possible that some of these cleavages represent nonspecific cleavage of abundant proteins by blood proteases, although it is notable that the correlation between number of N termini discovered and protein abundance is weak.
PMC2842036	R05000	Most blood proteins are subject to proteolytic cleavage by a multitude of proteases in the secretory pathway and the extracellular environment.
PMC2842036	R09002	After an activating cleavage to C3a and C3b by C3 convertase complexes, factor I and other enzymes inactivate C3b by additional cleavages.
PMC2842036	R10005	For plasma and serum, subtiligase labeling has some advantage in that it does not rely on the absolute efficiency of internal peptide depletion or lysine blocking.
PMC2842036	R11000	Additional reduction in complexity is afforded by the sequence specificity of subtiligase.
PMC2842036	R11001	Subtiligase is very promiscuous toward N-terminal sequences, but it disfavors certain N-terminal residues, including acidic side chains and proline (9).
PMC2842036	R11002	Several abundant serum proteins, including serum albumin and apolipoprotein A-I, have acidic N-terminal residues and are not efficiently labeled by subtiligase, reducing their relative abundance in our experiments.
PMC2842036	R13000	Specific proteases may be up-regulated in diverse disease states, and their activity may leave a mark on the plasma proteome.
PMC2842036	R14001	Tempst and coworkers have recently correlated exoprotease activities in blood to metastatic cancer (28).
PMC2842036	R15001	Apoptosis, a form of programmed cell death implicated in the response of cancer cells to chemotherapy and radiation, is executed by a family of cysteine proteases called caspases (25).
PMC2842036	R15002	Products of caspase proteolysis could serve as markers of successful cancer therapy.
PMC2842036	R15006	This cleavage has been reported in cell culture screens for apoptotic caspase substrates (10).
PMC2842036	R15007	In addition to this putative caspase-derived peptide, we also find some intracellular proteins with internal proteolytic cleavages, including abundant cellular proteins such as actin, as well as less abundant proteins, including the Ran-specific GTPase activating protein.
PMC2842036	R18000	In addition to identifying proteolyzed products generally present in blood, our method can also be used to identify substrates of specific proteases.
PMC2842036	R19002	However, MT-SP1 has also been shown to process a number of other substrates, including prohepatocyte growth factor activator, prourokinase plasminogen activator, and protease activated receptor 2 (39).
PMC2842036	R22000	N termini that increase in abundance after addition of MT-SP1 are not necessarily direct substrates of the protease.
PMC2842036	R22007	This observation is consistent with an active interplay between endo- and exoproteases in blood.

PMC2857342	R08002	Serine-type endopeptidases include trypsin, thrombin, and most notably numerous coagulation-pathway enzymes.
PMC2857342	R15000	The renal cyst fluid contains a large number of proteins from the SERPIN (serine-protease inhibitor) family.

PMC2860233	A00007	We selected α1-antitrypsin (p = 0.0001), leukocyte count (p = 0.066), alkaline phosphatase (p = 8.3 × 10−8), and performance status (p = 0.003) using multivariate Cox regression analysis and constructed a scoring system (nomogram) that was able to identify a group of high risk patients having a short median survival time of 150 days (95% confidence interval, 123–187 days; p = 2.0 × 10−15, log rank test).

PMC2860233	R05000	Univariate Cox regression analysis revealed that ECOG performance status and laboratory values including leukocyte count, albumin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, α1-antitrypsin, and α1-antichymotrypsin were correlated with overall survival of the 304 patients (p < 0.05; Table II).
PMC2860233	R05002	We searched for parameters using a forward stepwise selection procedure by AIC from all the clinical and laboratory data listed in Table II (available for all 304 cases) and found that a combination of α1-antitrypsin, alkaline phosphatase, leukocyte count, and ECOG performance status provided the lowest AIC value.

PMC2889050	I00000	Although many components of oncogenic signaling have been identified, the current clinically effective signal transduction therapeutics are primarily confined to a subset of targets such as receptor tyrosine kinases (1).
PMC2889050	I00002	One such area is Rho GTPase signaling, which has been hard to directly target (2) despite the extensive experimental evidence of its role in most aspects of cancer initiation and progression including uncontrolled proliferation, evasion of apoptosis, actin cytoskeletal remodeling, invasion, and metastasis (3–8).
PMC2889050	I00003	Members of the Rho-family GTPases (e.g., cdc42) in the activated, GTP-bound state bind directly to p21-activated kinases (PAKs) through an amino-terminal p21 binding domain to affect kinase activation and signaling (9–12).
PMC2889050	I00004	The PAKs are members of the STE20 serine/threonine kinase family (13) with two subgroups: PAK1, PAK2, and PAK3 (group A) and PAK4, PAK5, and PAK6 (group B).
PMC2889050	I00005	These kinases have been shown to have major yet varied roles in oncogenic processes (9–12, 14).
PMC2889050	I00007	Expression of activated PAK4 in NIH 3T3 cells is tumorigenic in nude mice, with tumors having less apoptosis (activated caspase 3 staining) and increased proliferation relative to control tumors (22).
PMC2889050	I00009	PAK4−/− mouse embryos have an increase in apoptosis (active caspase 3, sub-G0 population) and decreased proliferation (Ki67 staining) (23).
PMC2889050	I00010	PAK4−/− mouse embryonic fibroblast cells significantly attenuate oncogenic Ras-driven tumorigenesis and tumor growth (22), whereas PAK4 knockout cells completely abrogate tumor formation by an oncogenic variant of the direct upstream GTPase (cdc42V12) (22).
PMC2889050	I00011	In HeLa tumor cells, expression of active PAK4 blocks TNFα-induced apoptosis (PARP cleavage, caspase 3) (24), whereas siRNA PAK4 knockdown sensitizes tumor cells to TNFα-induced apoptosis and blocks anchorage-independent growth (25).
PMC2889050	I00012	A limitation of PAK4 siRNA knockdown is that PAK4 has been reported to have functions dependent on and independent of kinase activity (22, 26).
PMC2889050	I00013	A complementary approach, expression of kinase-inactive PAK4, demonstrated that anchorage-independent growth of HCT116 tumor cells requires PAK4 kinase activity (19).
PMC2889050	I00015	PAK4 substrates identified to date are consistent with its observed cellular functions: Rho GTPase activator guanine nucleotide exchange factor-H1 (GEF-H1) (21), apoptotic regulatory protein BAD (24), and cytoskeletal effector protein LIMK (31).
PMC2889050	I01001	However, most details regarding PAK4 biology, including the nature of pathways controlling tumor cell growth and survival, are largely unknown, and no potent inhibitors of PAK-family kinases have been reported.
PMC2889050	R00001	PF-3758309 was kinetically determined to be a potent, ATP-competitive inhibitor in a PAK4-kinase domain biochemical assay
PMC2889050	R00012	Using peptide substrates, PF-3758309 had similar enzymatic potency against the kinase domains of the other group B PAKs (PAK5, Ki = 18.1 ± 5.1 nM; PAK6, Ki = 17.1 ± 5.3 nM) and group A PAK1 (Ki = 13.7 ± 1.8 nM), but was less active against the other two group A PAKs (PAK2, IC50 = 190 nM; PAK3, IC50 = 99 nM).
PMC2889050	R01007	RNAi-mediated PAK4 protein knockdown induces A549 tumor cell apoptosis as measured by caspase 3 activation.
PMC2889050	R01008	Transfection of A549 tumor cells with 100 nM PAK4 siRNA resulted in 45% of A549 cells positive for caspase 3 activation at 72 h, whereas A549 cells transfected with control siRNAs showed less than 0.29% of cells with activated caspase 3 staining (SI Appendix).
PMC2889050	R02001	Achieving the appropriate level of kinase selectivity is essential to identify the appropriate clinical patients, rationally select therapeutic combinations, and identify efficacy biomarkers.
PMC2889050	R02009	In addition, the gem-dimethyl moiety of the pyrrolopyrazole core augments selectivity through steric clashes in other kinases (e.g., AUR2 L194/PAK4 V447 and LCK T316/PAK4 M305).
PMC2889050	R02010	The phenyl ring makes a hydrophobic interaction with the glycine loop, a critical interaction for selectivity over other kinases such as Cdk2.
PMC2889050	R02011	The structure-based design of PF-3758309 facilitated the optimization of potency and the enhancement of kinase selectivity.
PMC2889050	R03000	To begin to understand the potential range of biological activities, PF-3758309 was broadly profiled in enzymatic assays of recombinant kinase domains.
PMC2889050	R03001	PF-3758309 was screened at a permissive ATP concentration (Km) against 146 of the 518 known human kinases to estimate off-target activities with a potential for cellular activity (IC50 < 5,000 nM) assuming ATP-competitive inhibition, published Km,ATP values, and a cellular ATP concentration of 2 mM (SI Materials and Methods).
PMC2889050	R04004	We were therefore able to define a PAK4 inhibitor-specific biological “fingerprint” or “signature” (Fig. 2) which was compared with the signatures of well-characterized inhibitors of kinases identified as PF-3758309 biochemical screening hits.
PMC2889050	R04005	Related potent pyrrolopyrazole inhibitors designed to inhibit PKC (36) (e.g., PF-04577806) did not inhibit PAK4 (PAK4, Ki = 52 μM, pGEF-H1 cellular IC50 = 10 μM), nor did they modulate any of the assays that constitute the PAK4 signature at 1 μM. As PF-3758309 had biochemical activity toward Src-family kinases in vitro, we compared PF-3758309 cellular signaling activity with the well-characterized Src-family inhibitor Dasatinib (Fig. 2).
PMC2889050	R05009	The observed inhibition of Mnk1/p38α complexes (Fig. 2) may also be linked to PAK biology: Mnk was previously shown to be phosphorylated by caspase-activated PAK2 and an unidentified cdc42-dependent kinase (39).
PMC2889050	R06011	In addition, PAK-family kinases and p53 expression have been reported to be coregulated (43, 44).
PMC2889050	R06013	Nevertheless, our results are consistent with PAK4, and by extension certain Rho GTPases, as upstream regulators of p53, and also indicate that pharmacologic modulation of p53 does not directly affect PAK4 expression or activity in these settings.
PMC2889050	R08007	PF-3758309 treatment showed a significant increase in the apoptotic marker activated caspase 3 in HCT116 tumors (Fig. 4), which was also observed in cellular studies (Fig. 2).

PMC2909202	A00001	In the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, potential candidates for erythrocyte remodelling include the apicomplexan-specific FIKK kinase family (20 members), several of which have been demonstrated to be transported into the erythrocyte cytoplasm via Maurer's clefts.
PMC2909202	D00000	In this work, we demonstrate that two members of the FIKK kinase family are involved in the remodeling of erythrocyte membrane skeleton proteins.
PMC2909202	D00005	This indicates an elevated level of post-translational modifications of the host cell by parasite kinases.
PMC2909202	D01009	One possibility is that this substrate might be a substrate for a variety of kinases in the erythrocyte and that FIKK12 might phosphorylate a particular site.
PMC2909202	D02001	Furthermore, we do not know if these FIKK kinases target directly erythrocyte membrane proteins or are involved in a phosphorylation cascade.
PMC2909202	D02002	At this stage, we can not rule out the possibility that differences in the phosphoproteomes of the KO lines are derived from the lack of activity of non FIKK kinase regulated by FIKK12 or 7.1.

PMC2909202	I01000	Recently we showed that some members of the apicomplexa-specific FIKK kinase family are transported to the erythrocyte membrane via Maurer's clefts [17].
PMC2909202	I01004	Due to the restricted homology with well-characterized kinase domains, the FIKK proteins did not cluster within any of the kinase groups described in higher eukaryotes [19].
PMC2909202	I02000	In this work, we have analyzed the biological role of two members of the P. falciparum FIKK kinase family (FIKK7.1 and FIKK12) in IEs.
PMC2909202	I02001	We show that both FIKK kinases are non-essential for parasite growth in vitro.

PMC2909202	R02000	Given the transit of several FIKK kinases via Maurer's clefts and the presence of a variable N-terminal domain in each protein we hypothesized that the kinase activity of these proteins might be involved in the trafficking of parasite-encoded variant surface molecules, such as the adhesion molecule Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1).

PMC3031520	I02002	However, the γ-glutamyl-ε-lysine cross-links are also elevated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and vascular dementia [15], indicating that increased transglutaminase activity is a common phenomenon in a variety of neurodegenerative disease and not specifically for HD
PMC3063153	A00004	Included in this differential set were Parkinson disease autosomal recessive, early onset 7 (PARK 7) and Alpha Synuclein (aSyn), both of which are known to be pathognomonic to Parkinson's disease as well as metabolic enzymes like Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (Nucleoside Phosphorylase) which has been exploited as therapeutic target in cancers.
PMC3063153	A00005	Tissue Microarray analysis confirmed higher expression of aSyn and Nucleoside Phosphorylase in ductal epithelia of pancreatic tumors compared to benign ducts.
PMC3063153	A00006	Furthermore, extent of both aSyn and Nucleoside Phosphorylase staining positively correlated with tumor stage and perineural invasion while their intensity of staining correlated with the existence of metastatic lesions in the PDAC tissues.
PMC3063153	A00007	From the biomarker perspective, Nucleoside Phosphorylase protein levels were higher in PDAC sera and furthermore serum levels of its downstream metabolites guanosine and adenosine were able to distinguish PDAC from benign in an unsupervised hierarchical classification model.
PMC3063153	A00008	Overall, this study for the first time describes elevated levels of aSyn in PDAC as well as highlights the potential of evaluating Nucleoside Phosphorylase protein expression and levels of its downstream metabolites to develop a multiplex panel for non-invasive detection of PDAC.
PMC3063153	D00020	However, the exact mechanism by which PARK-7 exerts its oncogenic effect is not clearly understood, although it is presumed to involve p38 mitogen activated-protein kinase signaling [60].
PMC3063153	D01001	One of these was Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (Nucleoside Phosphorylase), the rate limiting enzyme in salvage pathway involving purines, which is operational during inflammation as well as neoplastic progression, and has been highly targeted by various chemotherapeutic agents [61], [62], [63].
PMC3063153	D01002	In cancers, Nucleoside Phosphorylase activity has been previously reported to be high in cancer sera
PMC3063153	D01004	Nucleoside Phosphorylase expression has also been used to determine the clinical severity of various types of leukemias and lymphomas especially as a ratio to adenosine deaminase (ADA)[64].
PMC3063153	D01005	Likewise in the area of inflammation, Nucleoside Phosphorylase deficiency has been reported in immune deficient syndromes, like severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID)
PMC3063153	D01007	This strong association of Nucleoside Phosphorylase with inflammation and its earlier use in assessing severity of leukemia/lymphoma motivated us to evaluate the expression and activity of this protein in PDAC, specifically in patients with antecedent inflammatory conditions like chronic pancreatitis.
PMC3063153	D01010	Thus there are strong correlates to suggest that antecedent chronic inflammation could be a known factor to develop PanIN or PDAC and Nucleoside Phosphorylase may be a useful marker to monitor the progression from inflammation to PDAC.
PMC3063153	D02000	Importantly, no previous studies have considered measuring expression of Nucleoside Phosphorylase protein or its regulated metabolites in PDAC.
PMC3063153	D02001	Our results on Nucleoside Phosphorylase protein levels in sera show the presence of two bands at ∼32 KDa predominantly in PDAC sera compared to controls.
PMC3063153	D02003	Although this needs to be validated in PDAC, Nucleoside Phosphorylase phosphorylation has been earlier reported in neuronal cells exposed to oxidative stress [69].
PMC3063153	D02004	Further, in a proof-of-concept setting, our results also show alterations in levels of metabolic intermediates downstream of Nucleoside Phosphorylase, in PDAC sera, alluding to the existence of an active NP-driven purine salvage pathway in these tumors.
PMC3063153	D02007	Furthermore, it will be interesting to focus future investigations on evaluating the potential of Nucleoside Phosphorylase to predict PDAC's with antecedent chronic pancreatitis and the influence on the development of PanINs in the inflammatory milieu.
PMC3063153	D03001	Furthermore, the secretory profiles reveal Nucleoside Phosphorylase to be elevated in PDAC, indicative of a reliance of the tumor on the salvage pathway.
PMC3063153	D03003	This finding sets the stage to evaluate Nucleoside Phosphorylase as a possible marker to predict PDAC with antecedent pancreatitis, a clinical challenge that currently has no predictive markers.

PMC3063153	I01015	The latter included Alpha-Synuclein (aSyn) and metabolic enzymes like Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (Nucleoside Phosphorylase), both of which were elevated in pancreatic juice from patients with PDAC compared to benign controls.
PMC3063153	I01020	Also higher expression of Nucleoside Phosphorylase coupled to elevated levels of its down-stream metabolites, in serum had the potential to distinguish PDAC patients from benign controls, highlighting their biomarker potential.
PMC3063153	R00006	Importantly, our data suggests existence of a Parkinson's disease protein signature in PDAC and describes the combined ability of Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase protein and its regulated metabolites in serum to distinguish PDAC patients from benign individuals.
PMC3063153	R01005	The latter included Alpha-Synuclein (aSyn) that is known to be associated with Parkinson's Disease [37], [38], [39], as well as proteins like Purine Nucleoside Phosphorylase (Nucleoside Phosphorylase), Valosin Containing Protein (VCP), Thrombospondin-1(THBS1) etc, all of which were found to be elevated in PDAC-derived juice specimens.
PMC3063153	R03000	In addition to the above finding, we also examined the association of Nucleoside Phosphorylase with PDAC in greater detail as the activity of this enzyme, a critical component of salvage metabolism of purines, is extensively used by tumors to replenish their nucleotide pools.
PMC3063153	R03001	Importantly, as shown in Figure 2A, Nucleoside Phosphorylase levels were higher in PDAC-associated juice compared to benign controls.
PMC3063153	R03002	The higher levels of this protein in PDAC combined with the earlier report on elevated Nucleoside Phosphorylase activity in cancers [41], motivated us to evaluate this protein in PDAC tissues.
PMC3063153	R03003	As shown in Figure 3A, immunoblot analysis confirmed elevated expression of Nucleoside Phosphorylase in PDAC tissues compared to benign specimens.
PMC3063153	R03005	Nucleoside Phosphorylase staining on the TMA was categorized as weak, moderate or strong as described earlier for PARK-7 and aSyn.
PMC3063153	R03006	As shown in Figure 3B and quantified in Figure 3D, all the benign specimens (n = 26) showed weak (∼77%) to moderate (∼19%) staining for Nucleoside Phosphorylase while majority of the PDAC specimens (n = 67) exhibited a strong staining pattern (∼79%) for the protein (Figure 3C, D).
PMC3063153	R03007	This strong association of Nucleoside Phosphorylase with PDAC tissue combined with its secretory nature (Figure 2A) prompted us to examine the protein levels for Nucleoside Phosphorylase in serum of PDAC and control individuals.
PMC3063153	R03008	As shown in Figure 3E, immunoblot analysis for Nucleoside Phosphorylase in serum revealed two bands at ∼32 KDa.
PMC3063153	R03010	When quantified relative to IgM (loading control), the normalized intensity for upper immunoreactive band for Nucleoside Phosphorylase was found to be significantly elevated in PDAC sera (n = 35, p<0.01, two-sided t-test using log-transformed data) compared to benign controls (n = 20, Figure 3F), while it was undetectable in a subset of sera from other tumor types (Figure S5).
PMC3063153	R03011	This predominance of Nucleoside Phosphorylase expression in PDAC sera supported by an earlier report on its elevated enzyme activity in cancers [41] alluded to the possibility of finding altered levels of its target metabolites in serum of PDAC patients.
PMC3063153	R03012	Accordingly, levels of 7 metabolites namely adenine, adenosine, guanine, guanosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine and inosine which are either substrates or products of Nucleoside Phosphorylase were measured in PDAC and benign sera using targeted LC-MS/MS.
PMC3063158	A00001	Among them, the insensitive acetylcholinesterase (ace-1R allele) is widespread worldwide and confers cross-resistance to organophosphates and carbamates.
PMC3063158	D01007	In addition, major salivary proteins - including the apyrase and D7 proteins - are known to be significantly down-regulated in infected Anopheles compared to uninfected mosquitoes [33], [34].
PMC3063158	D02000	Conversely, three other proteins, namely endoplasmin, triosephosphate isomerase and heat shock protein (heat shock protein) were significantly over-expressed in the salivary glands of Ace.1 resistant mosquitoes.
PMC3063158	D02001	Triosephosphate isomerase is an enzyme involved in glycolysis which takes place in the cytosol of cells.

PMC3063158	R03002	Other salivary proteins were identified including apyrase, 5′nucleotidase, antigen 5 family (30 kDa Cq, AG5-3) and adenosine deaminase, which is believed to be involved in blood feeding (Figure 3, Table 1).
PMC3063158	R04001	These proteins were identified as endoplasmin, triosephosphate isomerase and a heat shock protein (HSP83).
PMC3063158	R04003	Among other housekeeping proteins, the salivary endonuclease which belongs to the hydrolase family was also identified (Table 1): this protein is believed to reduce local blood viscosity at the bite site to enhance the feeding process [31].
PMC3066142	A01001	Treatment with trypsin, or phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PiPLC), only minimally impaired membrane integrity.
PMC3066142	A01006	The enzymes carbonic anhydrase and APD-ribosyl cyclase were also enriched, plus Sm200 and alkaline phosphatase.
PMC3066142	A03002	We have investigated whether any proteins were exposed on the surface of live worms using incubation with selected hydrolases, in combination with mass spectrometry to identify released proteins.
PMC3066142	D01001	Thus the detection of proteins such as α2-macroglobulin, saposin B, and hemoglobinase (asparaginyl endopeptidase) in the two enzymatic shaving experiments was to be expected.
PMC3066142	D02006	For carbonic anhydrase this seems unlikely because of its assumed function in regulating acid-base balance at the parasite surface.
PMC3066142	D02009	The gene model for carbonic anhydrase is incomplete, lacking both the N-terminal exon encoding the signal peptide and the C-terminal exon(s) encoding the site for the attachment of a GPI-anchor.
PMC3066142	D04000	The two remaining GPI-anchored proteins shown to be enriched by iTRAQ labelling after PiPLC treatment were alkaline phosphatase and ADP-ribosyl cyclase.
PMC3066142	D04005	The recently characterised ADP-ribosyl cyclase was also shown to be GPI-anchored and localized to the outer tegument of the adult schistosome [23].
PMC3066142	D04007	In the case of ADP-ribosyl cyclase, a role in calcium mobilization has been proposed [23] but alternatively it could function in immune evasion by regulating ecto-NAD+ levels, thereby reducing substrate availability for CD38- and CD157-mediated effector functions of lymphocytes.
PMC3066142	D04009	These were Sm200, alkaline phosphatase, two isoforms of CD59 orthologues and carbonic anhydrase.

PMC3066142	I01002	These compositional findings demonstrated the importance of the tegument for nutrient uptake and maintenance of solute balance, as well as the presence of several hydrolases in the surface layers [6].
PMC3066142	I02002	We also incubated worms with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PiPLC) to release any externally accessible GPI-anchored proteins.
PMC3066142	I02004	Finally we used a phospholipase A2 (PLA2) preparation purified from snake venom to erode the lipid bilayer complex to determine if proteins could be selectively detached.
PMC3066142	R01003	They included three phospholipid-binding annexins and the membrane protease calpain.
PMC3066142	R02000	Although worm incubations were short-term, two known gut-derived proteases, asparaginyl endopeptidase and cathepsin B1 were detected.
PMC3066142	R03006	The analysis revealed the presence of proteins known to be GPI-anchored, such as ‘Surface protein’ (Sm200) and alkaline phosphatase.
PMC3066142	R03007	Protein orthologues of CD59 and carbonic anhydrase IV were novel features of this 2D map.
PMC3066142	R03008	The absence of gut proteases Sm31 and Sm32 was notable.
PMC3066142	R03009	The identities of other spots revealed the presence of cytosolic and cytoskeletal contaminants, including thioredoxin, fatty acid binding protein (Sm14), Sm22.6, enolase and triose phosphate isomerase (Table S3).
PMC3066142	R04011	The PiPLC-enriched proteins of parasite origin were, in descending order of abundance, Sm29, CD59a, Sm200, carbonic anhydrase, CD59b, alkaline phosphatase and ADP-ribosyl cyclase (Figure 3).
PMC3066142	R04014	Equivalent amounts of cytosolic (e.g, enolase, 14-3-3) and cytoskeletal proteins (e.g, actin, Sm20.8) in control and treated samples (Figure 3 and Table S4) indicated a certain degree of surface damage, but not inflicted by the PiPLC treatment.
PMC3066142	R07002	The exceptions were the proteoglycan (5L and 0A) and ADP-ribosyl cyclase (0L and 1A).

PMC3067499	I02000	A number of serine proteases belonging to the subtilisin-like family (clan SB) (62) have been identified in apicomplexan parasites.
PMC3067499	I02002	The Plasmodium genome contains genes for just three subtilisin-like proteases, of which two—SUB1 and SUB2—appear to be indispensable in asexual blood stages (73, 78).
PMC3067499	I02004	There, PfSUB1 directly mediates the proteolytic maturation of a family of abundant, soluble, papain-like putative proteases called the serine-rich antigen (SERA) family, previously implicated in egress (1, 58, 78).
PMC3067499	R01000	Proteases usually recognize their substrates in an extended β-strand conformation, but in addition to simple primary sequence, surrounding secondary or tertiary structural elements in macromolecular substrates can be important in preventing or facilitating access to scissile bonds.
PMC3067499	R06014	Previous work has shown that short synthetic peptides based on authentic PfSUB1 cleavage sites can act as good substrates for the protease, so to test our predictions, peptides based on the two predicted MSRP2 sites were assayed for sensitivity to cleavage.
PMC3067499	R07005	The protease that mediates this cleavage is unknown.
PMC3068262	A01005	Telomerase activity in SW1116cells was checked by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.
PMC3068262	A02006	The proteomic analysis showed that the 26 protein spots were differently expressed in SW1116 cells and 10 protein spots were identified as ubiquitin fusion-degradation 1-like protein, nuclear chloride channel protein, tubulin β, Raichu404X, stratifin, F-actin capping protein α-1 subunit, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 delta isoform 2, hypothetical protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and guanine nucleotide binding protein β polypeptide 2-like 1, respectively.
PMC3068262	D09000	In this study, the expression of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) was down-regulated in SW1116 cells.
PMC3068262	D09001	glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, a multifunctional protein with defined functions in numerous subcellular processes, plays an integral role in glycolysis.
PMC3068262	D09002	New investigations are needed to establish the primary role of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in a variety of critical nuclear pathways apart from its already recognized role in apoptosis.
PMC3068262	D09003	The new roles of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase include its requirement for transcriptional control of histone gene expression[36], its essential function in nuclear membrane fusion, its necessity for recognition of fraudulently incorporated nucleotides in DNA, and its mandatory participation in maintenance of telomere structure.
PMC3068262	D09004	To undertake these new functions, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is recruited to the nuclei in S phase or its intracellular distribution is regulated as a function of drug exposure.
PMC3068262	D09005	Further study is needed to explore the functions of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in SW1116 cells.

PMC3068262	R09000	Ten out of the differently expressed protein spots were chosen and identified as ubiquitin fusion-degradation 1 like protein, nuclear chloride channel protein, tubulin β, Raichu404X, stratifin, F-actin capping protein α-1 subunit, eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 delta isoform 2, hypothetical protein, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and guanine nucleotide binding protein β polypeptide 2-like 1, respectively, as detected by Western blotting (Table ​(Table33).
PMC3071361	A00005	Actin-rich cytoskeleton components, GTPases from the Rac and Rab families, filamin, α-actinin and a newly identified ezrin-moesin-radixin protein were the main factors found to potentially interact with capped receptors.
PMC3071361	A00006	A set of specific cysteine proteases and a serine protease were enriched in isolated uropod fractions.
PMC3071361	A00007	However, biological assays indicated that cysteine proteases are not involved in uropod formation in E. histolytica, a fact in contrast to the situation in human motile immune cells.
PMC3071361	A01005	In addition to the presence of several proteases and novel cytoskeleton factors, our proteomic results highlight the presence of important surface components including the Gal/GalNAc lectin, calreticulin, several adhesion molecules and the immunodominant antigen M17.
PMC3071361	A01007	Firstly, cysteine proteases are not involved in uropod formation in E. histolytica.
PMC3071361	D03000	A striking difference between uropods from human cells and those in E. histolytica concerns the role of cysteine proteases.
PMC3071361	D03003	The protease then cleaves the four last amino acids of the β2-chain, resulting in its binding to talin - a crucial step in uropod elongation and cell polarization [23].
PMC3071361	D03005	Alternatively, other proteases may have a role in uropod formation, despite the fact that knockdown of the rhomboid serine protease (which specifically localizes at the base of the cap, rather than in the cap itself) had no significant impact on cap formation [65].
PMC3071361	D03006	The fact that cysteine proteinases from the C family were highly represented in the UEF make these factors relevant for further analysis.
PMC3071361	D03007	Although cysteine proteases has been found into internal vesicles and/or on the amoebic surface, little is known about the potential association of trafficking vesicles and uropod membranes and/or subcortical cytoskeleton, but we cannot exclude this possibility.

PMC3071361	F64001	Baxt LA, Rastew E, Bracha R, Mirelman D, Singh U. Downregulation of an Entamoeba histolytica rhomboid protease reveals roles in regulating parasite adhesion and phagocytosis.
PMC3071361	I02015	Insight into the capping process's mechanism has also been gained recently: a serine protease from the rhomboid family concentrates in the vicinity of the uropod and cleaves the Gal/GalNAc HgL subunit in vitro[21].
PMC3071361	I02016	These findings highlight the potential role of a large number of amoebic proteases in surface receptor capping and uropod formation.
PMC3071361	I02017	Functional links between proteinases and uropod formation have also been observed in other eukaryotic cells.
PMC3071361	I02018	For instance, leukocyte migration is promoted by the activity of cathepsin X, a cysteine peptidase localized at the uropod and which modulates the interaction between β2 integrin and the actin-rich cytoskeleton [22], [23].
PMC3071361	I03001	These cytoskeleton functions are regulated by a panel of important proteins, including the small GTPases RacG
PMC3071361	I03003	[28], their corresponding GTP exchange factors [29], [30], [31], the PAK kinases [32],
PMC3071361	I04002	In addition, our results also suggest the presence of immunodominant variable surface antigen M17 [35], a number of proteins involved in multiple drug resistance [36] , a set of specific ATPases, a number of small GTPases, cysteine proteases, at the uropod enriched fractions.
PMC3071361	I04003	Given the potential roles of immunodominant M17 antigen and cysteine proteases in the pathogenesis of amoebiasis, we verified the enrichment of M17 at uropod and investigated the potential roles cysteine proteases in uropod formation, using cell biology approaches.
PMC3071361	M00003	100 µM of both E64 were used, at this concentration the enzymatic activity of cysteine proteases is inhibited by 95% as measured by the degradation of the synthetic substrate Z-RR-AMC (Sigma) (data not shown).
PMC3071361	R02006	Signalling molecules accounted for a significant proportion of the UEF proteome, with the most numerous being small GTPases from the Rho and Rab families.
PMC3071361	R02009	Surface molecules, cytoskeletal proteins and amoebic proteases were also identified.
PMC3071361	R02011	We further characterized the surface proteins, the cytoskeleton proteins and the proteinases since these categories are potentially involved in the surface receptor capping process and the anti-amoeba immune reactions (Table 1).
PMC3071361	R02012	In addition to the stringency of protein selection, one important criteria allowing us to goes further in this analysis was the fact that for example surface antigens such ARIEL [40], kinase receptors abundant family [41] or β-tubulin (nucleus marker) were not present in this proteomic analysis indicating that we have in the analyzed fraction proteins mostly linked to UEF.
PMC3071361	R03013	It has a signal peptide and seven furin-like cysteine rich regions that is found in a variety of proteins and involved in signal transduction via receptors tyrosine kinase
PMC3071361	R04003	[26], the small GTPase Rac G [27], guanine exchange factors [29], filamin [34] and α-actinin [19].
PMC3071361	R04010	Spectrin family proteins and the associated kinases are known to redistribute to the uropod following T cell activation during the onset of inflammation [51].
PMC3071361	R05000	Proteases were another category of the main factors found in the UEF (Table 2).
PMC3071361	R05001	The cysteine proteases were all endopeptidases (seven in total): CP-A1, CP-A2 and CP-A5 from the very well known A family and CP-C4, C5, -C6 and -C13 from the C family.
PMC3071361	R05003	Several studies have shown that peptidases (particularly cysteine peptidases) are major pathogenicity factors in E. histolytica[54].
PMC3071361	R05006	This protease contains an Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD) integrin binding motif which has also been found in the proregion of cathepsin X from higher eukaryotes [57].
PMC3071361	R05009	In addition to cysteine proteinases, we also identified Sp2 one of the members of a family of three amoebic serine proteases (i.e. S28 family)
PMC3071361	R05010	[58] and two dipeptidyl-peptidases from the lipase family which hydrolyze tryglycerides, phospholipids and cholesterol esters [59].
PMC3071361	R06001	The released surface proteins, cytoskeleton-related proteins and cysteine proteases identified herein might help us to understand the mechanism of surface receptor capping and uropod formation.
PMC3071361	R07000	Active cysteine proteinases (such as cathepsin X) have been shown to interact with β2 integrin and to cause cytoskeletal rearrangements that stimulate T lymphocyte migration and uropod formation.
PMC3071361	R07001	Membrane-associated E. histolytica cysteine and serine proteases may have a role in the degradation of the tight junctions of target cells, since it has been reported that use of the corresponding inhibitors prevents this process [58], [60].
PMC3071361	R07002	Therefore, we sought to investigate whether or not cysteine proteases present in the UEF have hydrolytic activity and so determined the protease activity of this fraction in a gelatin gel assay (Figure 4A).
PMC3071361	R07003	The data evidenced a good correlation between the patterns generated by peptidases present in the UEF on one hand and the digestion pattern previously published carrying CP-A1, CP-A2 and CP-A5 activities on the other [61].
PMC3071361	R07005	We thus can infer that active cysteine proteinases were present in the UEF.
PMC3071361	R07008	In order to investigate the impact of cysteine proteinases in E. histolytica uropod formation, we determined the influence of cysteine protease inhibitors on the uropod formation efficiency.
PMC3071361	R07013	This finding indicated that although cysteine proteinases are abundant and active in the uropod fraction, they do not influence the dynamics of receptor capping or uropod formation.
PMC3071361	R07014	Cysteine proteinases are important for pathogenicity in E. histolytica; given their abundance in the extruded amoebic uropod fractions, we expected them to have much the same functions in surface receptor capping and uropod formation as they do in leukocytes.
PMC3071361	R07015	However, inhibition of cysteine protease activity did not significantly modify the efficiency of cap formation and thus emphasized a contrast with the known role of cysteine peptidases in leukocyte uropod formation.
PMC308900	A00002	Towards this end, a 32-kDa putative glyoxalase in the culture filtrate (CF) of growing M. tuberculosis (originally annotated as Rv0577 and hereafter designated CFP32) was identified, cloned, and characterized.

PMC308900	R01002	The region upstream of cfp32 also contains several putative regulatory elements that are homologous to previously described mycobacterial −10 and −35 RNA polymerase contact sites (n = 3 and 5, respectively), including three −35 sites identified for the CF virulence factor katG (44; data not shown).
PMC308900	R01004	The biological significance of such an arrangement of two stop codons is not known but has been noted previously for the glutamine synthetase gene of M. tuberculosis, E. coli, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (27).
PMC308900	R02010	Remarkably, the alignment of CFP32 homologues revealed several highly conserved amino acids, several of which were also present in a surprising number of ostensibly paralogous glycosyl hydrolases (one example is given in Fig. ​Fig.3B).3B).
PMC308900	R02012	These aspartic acids were each in the context of a DPXG motif analogous to that for the determined enzymatic nucleophile (the residue that forms the enzyme-substrate intermediate during cleavage) of the well-characterized class II (family 38) α-mannosidases (32).

PMC308900	R05007	Even so, there are several other known CF protein genes that do not code for the classical signal peptides, including superoxide dismutase (28), glutamine synthetase (27), and CFP29 (54) as well as ESAT-6 and CFP10 (65).
PMC308900	R11000	Previously, the coexpression of mRNA for IFN-γ with IL-10, IL-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase, by lung cells from patients with active pulmonary TB, was described [48; M. D.

PMC308900	R12001	This CFP32 protein appears to be a bimodular glyoxalase localized to both the cytosolic and CF compartments of M. tuberculosis.
PMC3098579	A00011	Furthermore, by using a highly selective inhibitor of the cysteine protease dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 3 (DPAP3) that has been shown to be a key regulator of host cell rupture, we were able to identify specific substrates whose processing may be of particular importance to the process of host cell rupture.
PMC3098579	A00013	These data also provide insight into the biochemical events that take place during host cell rupture and are likely to be valuable for the study of proteases that could potentially be targeted for therapeutic gain.
PMC3098579	D01008	This information may lead to the identification of proteases that, like DPAP3 and Sub-1, either directly or indirectly mediate proteolytic processing events that are required for host cell rupture.

PMC3098579	F31002	A Plasmodium falciparum dipeptidyl aminopeptidase I participates in vacuolar hemoglobin degradation.
PMC3098579	I01000	A number of recent studies have determined that both serine and cysteine proteases are key regulators of host cell rupture (1–3).
PMC3098579	I01001	In particular, the serine protease subtilisin 1 (PfSUB1) (3) and the cysteine protease dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 3 (DPAP3)1 (1) have been found to be essential for parasite-mediated host cell rupture.
PMC3098579	I01006	In addition, such a map of proteolytic processing events may help to identify families of proteases that mediate these events.
PMC3098579	I01007	Protease targets that direct the processing of key proteolytic events required for host cell rupture would therefore be potentially valuable targets for new classes of antimalarial drugs.
PMC3098579	I02000	Although many proteases have been studied in detail, the mapping of specific protein substrates has been limited by the lack of analytical methods that facilitate identification of a cleaved peptide product.
PMC3098579	I02001	The past few years have seen a rapid growth in the development of methods to globally identify substrates of proteases.
PMC3098579	I03003	When a protein is processed by a protease, the location of the protein fragments in the gel often changes.
PMC3098579	R06001	We focused on the plasmepsins, falcipain-3, and SERA family proteases as each of these enzymes is processed in multiple locations during maturation to produce the active protease (3, 27, 28).
PMC3098579	R06003	3B lists the semitryptic peptides that we observed in our data set that matched the predicted peptides for each of the target proteases.
PMC3098579	R06004	We identified one of the sites of autocatalytic processing of falcipain-3 and one expected semitryptic peptide for each of two plasmepsin proteases (PF14_0075 and PF14_0078).
PMC3098579	R07004	4A shows peptographs comparing the T = −6 with T = 0 samples for the cysteine protease falcipain-3 (PF11_0162) for both the membrane and cytosolic fractions.
PMC3098579	R08004	A potential candidate for this event would be dipeptidyl aminopeptidase 1 (DPAP1), which is also present in the food vacuole and whose processing activity would likely be blocked after one cleavage event by the proline residues found in the N-terminal sequence.
PMC3098579	R09004	The semitryptic peptide in the most N-terminal peptide corresponds to the predicted cleavage site of subtilisin-1, a serine protease that was recently shown to be a key regulator of host cell rupture (3).
PMC3098579	R10004	To further characterize these, we chose to perform PROTOMAP analysis on samples of parasites that had been treated with a specific inhibitor of DPAP3, a cysteine protease that we previously showed is a key regulator of host cell rupture.
PMC3098579	R12003	This could be expected for a protease such as DPAP1 that is located in the food vacuole with a role in hemoglobin degradation (32).
PMC3100311	A00002	However other proteases, which activate during episodes of angioedema, might also contribute to BK production.
PMC3100311	D00003	Upon such binding the zymogen serine proteases autoactivate and initiate the effector phase of the complement cascade [11].
PMC3100311	D00009	It was shown however, that MASP-1 can augment the activity of MASP-2 either by activating zymogen MASP-2 or facilitating C3-convertase formation due to its C2 digesting activity [28], [34], [35].
PMC3100311	D00011	The crystal structure of MASP-1 [16] suggests that it has more relaxed substrate specificity than related complement proteases having only one or two natural substrates (e. g. C1r, C1s, MASP-2).
PMC3100311	D03008	Since MASP-1 autoactivates spontaneously in the absence of inhibitors, it is possible that this protease cleaves HK, even in the absence of any contact system activator, contributing to the elevated baseline level of BK observed in HAE patients [7], [42].

PMC3100311	I02004	MBL and ficolins form multimolecular complexes with serine proteases (MBL-associated serine proteases = MASPs) that autoactivate upon the recognition molecules bind to the activator structures [11].
PMC3100311	I02005	One of the MASPs, MASP-2, is able to initiate the complement cascade, since it can cleave C2 and C4, the components of the C3-convertase enzyme complex.
PMC3100311	I02006	MASP-1 however cannot induce C3-convertase formation alone, since it cannot cleave C4.
PMC3100311	R01000	C1-inhibitor is known to inhibit all 3 proteases [1], [4], [16], [17].
PMC3100311	R01001	In order to check weather C1-inhibitor is able to prevent cleavage of HK by rMASP-1, rMASP-2 or kallikrein, a molar excess of C1-inhibitor (compared to the protease) was added to HK before the addition of the protease to a set of samples.
PMC3100311	R05000	All proteases can cleave HK at other positions as well, since besides the BK peak, peaks of other unidentified peptides are present in the chromatograms (Figure 2).
PMC3100311	R09000	The HK preparations used can potentially contain contaminating proteases.
PMC3108827	A00007	In addition to previously reported proteins found in multiple sclerosis cerebrospinal fluid, such as αβ crystallin, enolase, and 14–3-3-protein, we have identified several additional molecules involved in mitochondrial and energy metabolism, myelin gene expression and/or cytoskeletal organization.
PMC3108827	A00008	These include aspartate aminotransferase, cyclophilin-A, quaking protein, collapsin response mediator protein-2, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, and cofilin.
PMC3108827	A00009	To further validate these findings, the cellular expression pattern of collapsin response mediator protein-2 and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 were investigated in human chronic-active MS lesions by immunohistochemistry.
PMC3108827	A00010	The observation that in multiple sclerosis lesions phosphorylated collapsin response mediator protein-2 was increased, whereas Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 was down-regulated, not only highlights the importance of these molecules in the pathology of this disease, but also illustrates the use of our approach in attempting to decipher the complex pathological processes leading to multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases.
PMC3108827	D01003	In line with previous reports, molecules such as αβ-crystallin, enolase, 14–3-3 protein and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase were also identified (11, 15, 49) in the MS-CSF, thus validating our experimental approach.
PMC3108827	D02002	In this context, it is noteworthy that antibodies to AE, triose phosphate isomerase, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase have been shown to be present in the CSF from MS patients (15, 51, 52).
PMC3108827	D02005	Similarly, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase and PK are components of KATP channels and can be immunoprecipitated along with potassium channel subunit Kir 6.2, suggesting that these enzymes could influence the regulation of KATP channels function (37).
PMC3108827	D02008	glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, on the other hand is associated with γ-aminobutyric acid-type A receptors and functions as a kinase involved in maintaining γ-aminobutyric acid-type A receptors-mediated responses (55); inhibition of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase activity leads to induction of apoptosis (56).
PMC3108827	D02012	The generation of reactive molecules, particularly antibodies to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, triose phosphate isomerase, or PK could influence the activity of these molecules and potentially be of pathological significance.
PMC3108827	D02016	For example, whereas we have identified aldolase A, (another glycolytic enzyme) as a potential target, immunization of C57BL/6 and NOD mice or Lewis rats with this protein does not lead to the development of any diseases (59).
PMC3108827	D02017	Likewise, whereas antibodies to alpha-enolase are associated with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and mixed cryoglobulnemia, these are nonpathogenic (45).
PMC3108827	D03000	Among the different glycolytic enzymes we detected in our study, is phosphoglycerate kinase, a molecule involved in regulating endocytosis, expressed in relatively high levels in cells (60).
PMC3108827	D03001	The presence of antibodies or other putative binding proteins could therefore inhibit the function of phosphoglycerate kinase and thus lead to impaired neural cell function.
PMC3108827	D03002	In addition to the glycolytic enzymes involved in the energy metabolism, creatine kinase B (CKB), a molecule involved in cellular energy homeostasis also reacted with MS-CSF (Table II, Figs. 3 and ​and4).4).
PMC3108827	D04005	One of the reactive molecules detected by our proteomic screening with biotinylated MS-CSF was the ATP synthase subunit alpha of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway from complex-V (Table II, Fig. 3 & 4).
PMC3108827	D04006	Interestingly, the cytosolic accumulation of ATP synthase alpha subunit is associated with early degenerating neurons in Alzheimer's disease (67).
PMC3108827	D05000	Detection of MS-CSF reactivity to aspartate aminotransferase (aspartate aminotransferase) is interesting given the mitochondrial involvement in neurodegeneration.
PMC3108827	D05001	Indeed, aspartate aminotransferase utilizes oxaloacetate and glutamate to produce aspartate.
PMC3108827	D05003	Notably, the substrate for aspartate aminotransferase, N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), which is a key molecule used by oligodendrocytes for myelin lipid synthesis and is generated by neurons, has to be transported from the neuron to the myelinating oligodendrocytes (39, 40, 74).
PMC3108827	D05007	Apart from its role in T-cell activation and protein chaperoning, CypA participates in the caspase-independent route of programmed cell death, where the apoptosis inducing factor recruits the endonuclease CypA for its DNA degrading capability and perhaps may play a role in the neurodegenerative process (75).
PMC3108827	D06006	In line with the findings of Lovato and colleagues (15), we found that cyclicnucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase, one of the third most abundant myelin proteins of the CNS, reacted with MS-CSF.
PMC3108827	D06007	Although cyclicnucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase has been proposed as a putative autoantigen in MS, its encephalitogenic role has not yet been established and thus further investigations on its role in MS are warranted.

PMC3108827	M09005	Sections were washed in PBS-0.05% Tween-20 (pH7.4) for 5 min 3× before being incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody; goat anti-mouse (1:200 dilution, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) or goat anti-rabbit (1:300 dilution, Calbiochem).
PMC3108827	M09006	The Avidin-Biotin peroxidase (ABC) method was used for the sections of MS-2 incubated with SMI 31 and β-Tubulin antibodies.
PMC3108827	M09008	All sections were finally washed in PBS-0.05% Tween-20 (5 min, 3×) followed by incubation with ImmPACT™ diaminobenzidine peroxidase substrate (Vector) for 6 min and counterstained with Harris hematoxylin (Amber Scientific Midvale, Australia) for 20 s. Sections were dehydrated through absolute ethanol and xylene and mounted using DPX.
PMC3108827	R01005	Among those, six were only reactive to the MS-CSFs: these are glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, pyruvate kinase isozymes, UCH-L1/PGP 9.5, heat shock-related 70 kDa protein 2, cyclicnucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase and αβ-crystallin.
PMC3108827	R01006	The consitancy of the MS-CSF reactivity to many of these proteins, especially CRMP-2, dihydropteridine reductase, creatine kinase, guanine nucleotide-binding protein and quaking protein between the brain homogenate, myelin, and myelin-axolemmal complexes is shown in Fig.
PMC3108827	R02002	These are triose phosphate isomerase (triose phosphate isomerase), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), α-enolase (AE), fructose bisphosphate aldolase-A, pyruvate kinase (PK), and phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) (36, 37).
PMC3108827	R02004	For example, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and AE are involved in transcriptional regulation and apoptosis (36).
PMC3108827	R02005	Similarly, triose phosphate isomerase is involved in the regulation of KATP channels and its deficiency leads to neurodegeneration (37, 38).
PMC3108827	R02007	These include ATP synthase subunit α and voltage dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC-1).
PMC3108827	R02008	We also detected the cytoplasmic form of aspartate aminotransferase, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) involved in the mitochondrial energy metabolism and is critical for the myelin lipid synthesis (39, 40).
PMC3108827	R03001	Those belonging to myelin metabolism include 2′, 3′-cyclicnucleotide 3′-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), a potential autoantigen (15) whose role is not yet defined and the quaking protein, an RNA-binding protein that plays a central role in myelination.
PMC3108827	R03003	These include CRMP-2, γ enolase, cofilin, αβ-crystallin, cyclophilin A, creatine kinase B, and Ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1/PGP 9.5).

PMC3181243	A00002	While a serine peptidase with activity against insoluble elastin appears to be essential for this process in one species of schistosomes, Schistosoma mansoni, it is unknown whether other schistosome species use the same peptidase to facilitate entry into their hosts.
PMC3181243	A01000	Recent genome sequencing projects, together with a number of biochemical studies, identified alternative peptidases that Schistosoma japonicum or Trichobilharzia regenti could use to facilitate migration through skin.
PMC3181243	A01001	In this study, we used comparative proteomic analysis of human skin treated with purified cercarial elastase, the known invasive peptidase of S. mansoni, or S. mansoni cathespin B2, a close homolog of the putative invasive peptidase of S. japonicum, to identify substrates of either peptidase.
PMC3181243	A02000	This study demonstrates that an S. mansoni ortholog of the candidate invasive peptidase of S. japonicum and T. regenti, cathepsin B2, is capable of efficiently cleaving many of the same host skin substrates as the invasive serine peptidase of S. mansoni, cercarial elastase.
PMC3181243	A02001	At the same time, identification of unique substrates and the broader species specificity of cathepsin B2 suggest that the cercarial elastase gene family amplified as an adaptation of schistosomes to human hosts.
PMC3181243	A03001	In this paper, we have mined recent genome annotations of S. mansoni and S. japonicum, a zoonotic schistosome species, to identify differential expansion of peptidase gene families that may be involved in parasite invasion and subsequent migration through skin.
PMC3181243	A03002	Having identified a serine peptidase gene family in S. mansoni and a cysteine peptidase gene family in S. japonicum, we then used a comparative proteomic approach to identify potential substrates of representative members of both classes of enzymes from S. mansoni in human skin.
PMC3181243	A03003	The results of this study suggest that while these species evolved to use different classes of peptidases in host invasion, both are capable of cleaving components of the epidermis and dermal extracellular matrix, as well as proteins involved in the host immune response against the migrating parasite.
PMC3181243	D00000	In S. mansoni, the most abundant peptidase in cercarial secretions is a serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase (serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase) for its ability to degrade insoluble elastin [8], [22].
PMC3181243	D00001	In addition to proteomic analysis, biochemical and immunolocalization studies have detected serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase activity in cercarial secretions and confirmed that the enzyme is able to cleave such substrates as type IV collagen (basement membrane collagen), fibronectin, laminin and immunoglobulin in vitro[9], [10], [27].
PMC3181243	D00002	Here, we have shown that serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase cleaves additional substrates in skin, including several types of collagen, other extracellular matrix proteins, and components of the complement cascade.
PMC3181243	D01000	Recent sequencing and annotation of the S. mansoni genome suggests a unique role for cercarial elastase.
PMC3181243	D01001	An expanded gene family was identified with ten individual genes that encode multiple isoforms of the peptidase.
PMC3181243	D01002	Even without a complete genome, multiple orthologs of serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase have been also been found in S. haematobium, a related human-specific species of schistosome common throughout North Africa and the Middle East
PMC3181243	D01005	The S. japonicum genome contains only a single gene encoding cercarial elastase.
PMC3181243	D01006	This gene corresponds to the cercarial elastase “2b” isoform in S. mansoni, for which minimal transcript is made relative to other CE isoforms (Ingram and McKerrow, unpublished).
PMC3181243	D01007	While one report suggested that CE was detected by immunofluorescence in S. japonicum secretions, no cercarial elastase protein was detected in a high resolution mass spectrometric proteomic analysis of S. japonicum acetabular secretions, and no cercarial elastase-like activity was identified by direct biochemical assays
PMC3181243	D01009	Trichobilharzia regenti, an avian schistosome that is capable of invading human skin, but not establishing a successful infection in humans, encodes a cysteine peptidase, cathepsin B2 (TrCB2 (GenBank: ABS57370.1)), which has elastinolytic properties and localizes to the acetabular glands of the parasite [13].
PMC3181243	D01013	It is therefore likely that in S. japonicum cercariae, cathepsin B2, not cercarial elastase, is the predominant invasive enzyme.
PMC3181243	D02000	The differential use of these two classes of peptidases raises the question of how their respective pH optima are achieved in schistosome secretions.
PMC3181243	D02002	Since the influence of S. japonicum cercarial secretions on the local environment of skin is unknown, SmCB2 incubations were performed under acidic conditions to ensure optimal peptidase activity.
PMC3181243	D02003	serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase activity is optimal in a slightly alkaline environment, and S. mansoni secretions are also alkaline; therefore all serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase incubations were performed at pH 8 [29].
PMC3181243	D02005	The pH optimum of the cercarial elastase is 8, and the pH of the secretions is also alkaline [30].
PMC3181243	D02006	As S. mansoni cercariae migrate through skin, a microenvironment is created by the secreted material, which allows for optimal activity of the peptidase.
PMC3181243	D03002	While we cannot say conclusively that SjCB2 is the protease facilitating S. japonicum cercarial invasion, we believe that our study, along with previous work from other groups, supports the proposed role for cathepsin B2 in host skin protein degradation [12], [13].
PMC3181243	D04000	This conclusion, that S. japonicum uses a cathepsin B2 peptidase for skin invasion, while S. mansoni uses a serine peptidase (serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase), has implications for the evolution of the human host-parasite relationship in schistosomiasis.
PMC3181243	D04002	In contrast, the “humanized” parasites such as S. mansoni appear to have switched to a serine peptidase for cercarial invasion.
PMC3181243	D04003	This model is supported by the notable expansion of the serine peptidase gene family from the single 2b gene found in S. japonicum to the multiple isoforms expressed in S. mansoni[20], [33].
PMC3181243	D04004	While the genome of the other “humanized” parasite, S. haematobium, has not been completed, it is already clear from EST analysis that more abundant serine peptidase isoforms are present in that genome [15].
PMC3181243	D05000	What is the advantage of a larval serine peptidase for the “humanized” schistosomes?
PMC3181243	D05001	It is interesting to note that by BLAST analysis, some of the proteins with highest homology to cercarial elastase are mammalian mast cell peptidases, which are present in skin [12].
PMC3181243	D05002	It is therefore possible that cercarial elastase evolved by convergence to resemble a human peptidase, in order to evade detection by the host immune system.
PMC3181243	D05005	Cathepsin B2 is a likely target of the inflammatory response, given that many cysteine peptidases are allergenic [36].
PMC3181243	D05006	Perhaps the rapid transit of non-humanized cercariae through skin precludes the need for an invasive enzyme that mimics a host peptidase.
PMC3181243	D05008	C3 and C4 components bind to the tegument of schistosomes, but are degraded by both serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase and SmCB2 [26], [37].
PMC3181243	D06000	The results reported here show that S. mansoni cathepsin B2 (a model for S. japonicum cathepsin B2) and S. mansoni cercarial elastase are both capable of degrading proteins in skin that act as a barrier to cercarial invasion.
PMC3181243	D06001	Many skin proteins are substrates for both enzymes, but cathepsin B2 appears to cleave a broader range of substrates, and therefore may be a more effective invasive enzyme than cercarial elastase.

PMC3181243	I01003	These include histolytic peptidases [6], [7].
PMC3181243	I01004	The most abundant peptidase in S. mansoni secretions is an S1A serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase (serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase) (GenBank: AAC46967.1) that has activity against insoluble elastin and other fibrillar macromolecules of skin [8].
PMC3181243	I01005	Biochemical and immunolocalization studies have confirmed serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase activity in cercarial secretions [9], [10].
PMC3181243	I01006	Moreover, applying an irreversible serine peptidase inhibitor to ex vivo skin before exposure to cercariae blocks the majority of larvae from invading, suggesting that this serine peptidase has an essential role in skin penetration [11].
PMC3181243	I02000	While the serine peptidase, cercarial elastase, plays a key role in S. mansoni skin invasion, the zoonotic species S. japonicum has no serine peptidases in its larval secretions.
PMC3181243	I02001	S. japonicum, however, encodes a number of isoforms of cathepsin B2 (SjCB2) (GenBank: CAA50305.1), a cysteine peptidase, which are secreted by the invading parasite [12].
PMC3181243	I02003	This led us to the hypothesis that the primary invasive peptidase differs between schistosome species, with S. mansoni, a human-specific schistosome species, utilizing cercarial elastase, and S. japonicum, a zoonotic schistosome species, utilizing cathepsin B2.
PMC3181243	I02004	Given that T. regenti also appears to utilize cathepsin B2 for skin invasion, these observations suggest that the use of a serine peptidase in invasion is the exception, not the rule, among parasitic schistosomes.
PMC3181243	I02005	The use of cercarial elastase may reflect unique properties required by S. mansoni to preferentially infect human hosts.
PMC3181243	I03000	To confirm that cathepsin B2 is also capable of facilitating skin invasion, we used a proteomic approach to identify potential substrates in host skin, for both S. mansoni cercarial elastase and S. mansoni cathepsin B2 (SmCB2) (GenBank: CAC85211.2), a close homolog of S. japonicum CB2.
PMC3181243	I03002	We therefore chose to use a proteomic approach to validate the roles of these peptidases in skin invasion.
PMC3181243	I04000	We found that the vast majority of cleaved proteins resulting from human skin exposure to either purified serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase or SmCB2 overlap, suggesting that both enzymes are capable of facilitating parasite migration through skin.
PMC3181243	I04002	Candidate substrates were further validated by in vitro cleavage of purified human skin proteins with either peptidase.
PMC3181243	M00000	To determine the number of cercarial elastase and cathepsin B2 protein isoforms in schistosome species, all full-length protein sequences (i.e., those possessing the full catalytic core of the peptidase) were collected from both GenBank (NCBI) and S. japonicum and S. mansoni genome annotation websites (Sanger Institute GeneDB).
PMC3181243	M01001	serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase activity was purified from lysate as previously described with the following modifications [15].
PMC3181243	M01005	Fractions were again measured for serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase activity against AAPF-pNA (Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide), and active fractions were run on 10% bis-TRIS polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's specifications, and silver stained [16].
PMC3181243	M01006	For confirmation of protein identification, bands corresponding to the correct molecular weight of serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase were excised from the gel, and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion, followed by LC-MS/MS peptide sequencing, described below.
PMC3181243	M03003	Enzyme concentration was measured by active site titration using the cysteine peptidase inhibitor CAO74 (N-(L-3-trans-propylcarbamoyloxirane-2- carbonyl)-L-isoleucyl-L-proline).
PMC3181243	M05002	To each of these skin sections 100 µl of digestion solution containing either peptidase or inhibited peptidase at 1.8 µM was added, along with corresponding controls.
PMC3181243	M05003	serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase reaction buffer consisted of 100 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 8; SmCB2 reaction buffer consisted of 100 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.5, 4 mM DTT.
PMC3181243	M05004	Inhibited serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase was prepared by incubating 1.8 µM serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase with 2 µM AAPF-CMK for one hour at room temperature; inhibition was monitored against AAPF-pNA, prior to its addition to skin.
PMC3181243	M08003	For serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase digestion, 180 nM enzyme was added to 50 µl collagen I or 25 µl Complement C3 in 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0 and incubated at 37°C for 1–22 hours.
PMC3181243	M08004	Both enzymes were also pre-incubated with 1 mM CAO74 (SmCB2) or 1 mM AAPF-CMK (serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase) for one hour at room temperature prior to their addition to collagen.
PMC3181243	R00000	To outline the molecular evolution of larval peptidases in schistosomes, all previously reported orthologs were re-examined (Figure 1).
PMC3181243	R00001	In addition to the previously identified full-length cercarial elastase isoforms in S. mansoni--SmCE1a (GenBank: AAM43939.1), SmCE1b (GenBank: CAA94312.1), SmCE1c (GenBank: AAC46968.1), SmCE2a (AAM43941.1) and SmCE2b (GenBank: AAM43942.1) and Schistosoma haematobium cercarial elastase (GenBank: AAM4394)--sequencing and annotation of the full S. mansoni genome revealed three additional full-length genes [15], [20] (Figure 1A).
PMC3181243	R00002	In marked contrast, the S. japonicum genome contains only a single cercarial elastase isoform (Sjp_0028090).
PMC3181243	R00003	No cercarial elastase genes have been detected in any Trichobilharzia species.
PMC3181243	R01005	A full list of schistosome cercarial elastase and cathepsin B isoforms is provided as supplementary material (Tables S1 and S2).
PMC3181243	R02002	To identify specific substrates of CE in skin, and to compare these to potential substrates of cathepsin B2, we treated ex vivo skin with either peptidase.
PMC3181243	R02003	Since active, recombinant S. japonicum cathepsin B2 is not currently available, and purifying sufficient amounts of native peptidase from S. japonicum was not feasible, we used S. mansoni cathepsin B2 as model peptidase in our analysis.
PMC3181243	R02004	S. mansoni cathepsin B2 has high homology to the S. japonicum cathepsin B2 (90% sequence identity and 94% sequence similarity for the mature peptidase, see Figure S4), including the active site and substrate binding pocket, and therefore is likely to display highly similar biochemical properties and substrate specificity [17].
PMC3181243	R02005	serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase was purified directly from S. mansoni cercariae, and the protein composition of proteolytically active fractions was determined by mass spectrometric analysis as a mixture of SmCE1a, 1b and 2a isoforms, but not SmCE2b.
PMC3181243	R02008	To ensure that equimolar amounts of active enzyme were added to skin samples, an active site titration was first performed for both serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase and SmCB2 with respective covalent inhibitors.
PMC3181243	R03000	In comparison to control samples treated with inhibited peptidase, multiple skin proteins migrated through an SDS-PAGE gel as smaller fragments, i.e. fragments less than the predicted molecular weight of the full-length protein, upon addition of active serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase or SmCB2.
PMC3181243	R03002	Addition of both serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase and SmCB2 to skin led to the cleavage of collagen VI, which is found in interstitial tissue, and collagen XII, a collagen located in the basement membrane of the epidermis [23].
PMC3181243	R03004	In addition to collagen, several other components of the extracellular matrix were degraded upon treatment with either peptidase, including vitronectin, fibronectin, and galectin.
PMC3181243	R03005	Both vimentin and talin-1, cytoskeletal proteins that are associated with desmosomes, were cleaved upon addition of either peptidase.
PMC3181243	R04000	Another subset of extracellular proteins identified as substrates of serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase and SmCB2 were derived from blood plasma that bathes the dermis.
PMC3181243	R04001	These included components of the coagulation cascade, e. g. fibrinogen, antithrombin-III, as well as proteins involved in the host immune response, e. g. complement C3, complement factor D. Addition of either active serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase or SmCB2 led to the digestion of gelsolin, an actin assembly protein that exists intracellularly and in plasma.
PMC3181243	R04003	Complement C3, an integral component of both the classical and alternative complement activation pathways was cleaved upon addition of either serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase and SmCB2; complement C4A and complement D proteins, respective members of the classical and alternative complement activation pathways, were cleaved by SmCB2 alone.
PMC3181243	R05000	In addition to the extracellular proteins identified, many cytosolic proteins were also cleaved by either serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase or SmCB2.
PMC3181243	R06000	To corroborate proteomic identification of substrates in skin, candidate substrates were selected for in vitro digestion with either serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase or SmCB2.
PMC3181243	R06001	Type I collagen was of particular interest, given that lower molecular weight peptides of the protein were only found in skin samples treated with SmCB2, suggesting it is cleaved by SmCB2 but not serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase.
PMC3181243	R06002	To test this with purified protein, type I human collagen was treated with either SmCB2 or serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase for up to 22 hours at 37°C, and cleavage of the protein was determined by SDS-PAGE analysis (Figure 2).
PMC3181243	R06003	While the majority of collagen I was degraded after 5 hours with SmCB2 (Figure 2A), serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase treatment resulted in the appearance of discrete lower molecular weight bands only after 22 hours of enzyme treatment (Figure 2B).
PMC3181243	R06004	This confirms that serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase shows reduced activity against type I collagen relative to SmCB2, even in vitro.
PMC3181243	R06005	To confirm that the two peptidases cleaved collagen at unique sites, candidate lower molecular weight bands resulting from peptidase treatment were submitted for N-terminal sequencing, and the resulting amino acid sequence was mapped onto the full protein to determine cleavage sites (Figure 2C).
PMC3181243	R06006	Consistent with previous analysis of serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase substrate specificity, in vitro digestion of collagen I revealed that peptide bond cleavage only occurred following a leucine residue (VRGL/TGPI)
PMC3181243	R07000	Complement C3 was also of particular interest as a potential substrate of both serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase and SmCB2, given its role in the host immune response against the parasite [26].
PMC3181243	R07001	Purified complement C3 was treated with SmCB2 or serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase.
PMC3181243	R07002	Discrete lower molecular weight bands were visible within 1 hour of treatment with either peptidase, in comparison to inhibited peptidase controls (Figure 3A, B).
PMC3181243	R07003	N-terminal sequencing of selected fragments again revealed that both serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase and SmCB2 digested the protein in a manner consistent with their known specificities, with an arginine in the P1 position (RR/SVQ) for SmCB2 and and a tyrosine in the P1 position (TMY/HAK) for serine peptidase, termed cercarial elastase (Figure 3C).
PMC3188460	D00003	Based on these results, and the fact that these inhibitors are known to be effective against a broad spectrum of proteases (www.merops.org), they were mixed into a cocktail for use in WS.
PMC3188460	I00005	Recent evidence for saliva’s diagnostic capabilities include the identification of MMP-8 and -9 and osteoprotegrin as biomarkers for periodontal disease (Ramseier et al., 2009), changes in salivary inflammatory cytokine profiles in asthma exacerbations (Blicharz et al., 2009), salivary detection of HIV-1 (Liu et al., 2011), the correlation between salivary transcriptome markers KRAS, BMD3L2, ACRV1, and DPM1 and pancreatic cancer (Zhang et al., 2010), and salivary C-reactive protein, myoglobin, and myeloperoxidase biomarkers to detect acute myocardial infarction (Floriano et al., 2009).
PMC3188460	I00013	In addition, we used histatin 5, statherin, and proline-rich protein 1 (PRP1) as test proteins for monitoring salivary proteolysis, since these are natural salivary proteins that are quickly degraded by endogenous proteases in WS (Castagnola et al., 2004; Campese et al., 2009; Helmerhorst et al., 2010).
PMC3188460	R01010	The data confirmed the complete inhibition of salivary proteases at pH 3.0.

PMC3200215	A00001	Inactivation of A-T-mutated protein (ATM), a multifunctional protein kinase, is responsible for A-T, yet biochemical studies have not succeeded in conclusively identifying the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the neurodegeneration seen in A-T patients or the proteins that can be used as biomarkers for neurologic assessment of A-T or as potential therapeutic targets.
PMC3200215	D03000	In this proteomic study, we did not detect A-T-related proteins, such as ATM-related protein kinases or their substrates [7].
PMC3200215	D11000	The remaining eight significantly changed proteins in the Priority group 1 are SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), neurosecretory protein VGF, TPP1 (cDNA FLJ56402, highly similar to tripeptidyl-peptidase 1), neurocan core protein, chromogranin A, cathepsin D, SOD3 (extracellular superoxide dismutase), and ENPP2 (isoform 1 of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase family member 2) (Table 3).
PMC3200215	D14000	TPP1 (cDNA FLJ56402, highly similar to tripeptidyl-peptidase 1), also known as CLN2, is a member of the family of serine-carboxyl proteinases and plays a crucial role in lysosomal protein degradation; a deficiency in this enzyme leads to fatal neurodegenerative disease [58].
PMC3200215	F07002	A single ataxia telangiectasia gene with a product similar to PI-3 kinase.
PMC3200215	I01000	The ATM protein is a serine-threonine kinase that undergoes autophosphorylation in response to DNA damage and subsequently initiates a signaling cascade that involves the phosphorylation of several down-stream substrates, including p53, p53BP1, Chk2, BRCA1, and TRF2 [7, 9, 10].
PMC3233585	A01004	Five of them were verified to be differentially up-regulated in individual plasma of AAA patients: adiponectin, extracellular superoxide dismutase, protein AMBP, kallistatin and carboxypeptidase B2.
PMC3233585	D04000	Of the 12 proteins detected by WB analysis, five appeared to be differentially up-regulated in plasma samples of AAA compared to control patients: adiponectin, extracellular superoxide dismutase, carboxypeptidase B2, kallistatin, and protein AMBP.
PMC3233585	D06001	WB analysis confirmed five PAcIFIC identified proteins as potential biomarkers for early AAA diagnosis (i.e. adiponectin, extracellular superoxide dismutase, kallistatin, carboxypeptidase B2, and protein AMBP).
PMC3233585	R02005	For example, using representative identified proteins with known plasma concentrations we detected proteins of the following concentrations: 72 kDa type IV collagenase (8.8E+03 pg/mL), L-selectin (1.7E+04 pg/mL), beta-2-microglobulin (1.1E+06 pg/mL), apolipoprotein E (3.4E+07 pg/mL), ceruloplasmin (2.1E+08 pg/mL), alpha-2-macroglobulin (1.4E+09 pg/mL) and albumin (4.0E+10 pg/mL).
PMC3233585	R06001	From this analysis, 19 proteins were identified in the following three categories as most likely related to putative AAA biological mechanisms: 1) vascular remodeling (vinculin, alpha-actinin-1, talin-1, gelsolin, adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 (CAP1), profilin-1, and filamin-A), 2) intraluminal thrombus formation and coagulation (protein AMBP, extracellular superoxide dismutase, carboxypeptidase N catalytic chain (CPN1), carboxypeptidase B2, platelet basic protein, alpha-2-antiplasmin, pleckstrin, corticosteroid binding globulin, heparin cofactor 2, and kallistatin), and 3) inflammatory response (lysozyme C, and adiponectin).
PMC3233585	R07000	Of the 19 proteins chosen, only gelsolin, adiponectin, extracellular superoxide dismutase, corticosteroid-binding globulin, kallistatin, and carboxypeptidase B2 were detected and quantified by WB analysis in crude plasma (Fig.
PMC3233585	R07003	Specifically, adiponectin, kallistatin, extracellular superoxide dismutase, and carboxypeptidase B2 were detected as being abundant at significantly increased levels in AAA compared to control plasma samples.
PMC3235251	A02000	female plasma, vs. males contained pregnancy zone protein (419-580-fold), factor V (2-fold), α1-antitrypsin (2-fold), β2-microglobulin (2-fold), and complement factors H and C4B (1.5-2-fold) at significantly higher concentrations than males and males contained significant increases in Fc binding protein (2-fold), protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (2-fold), phosphatidylinositol-glycan specific phospholipase (4-fold), protein S-100 (3-fold) and transgelin-2 (14-fold) vs. females (p<.005).
PMC3235251	D00004	Males plasma showed an increase in Fc-binding protein, protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor, phosphatidylinositol-glycan specific phospholipase, protein S-100, and transgelin-2.
PMC3235251	D02000	α-1-antitrypsin is the best known serine protease inhibitor of the serpin family which has a structural conformation that allows it to bind tightly and inhibit serine proteases, including: neutrophil elastase, cathepsin G, and proteinase 3.21-23 α-1-antitrypsin deficiency is manifested by protease-induced bronchiectasis, lung injury, and liver damage including: cholestasis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and neutrophil cutaneous panniculitis.
PMC3235251	D02001	21-23 α-1-antitrypsin inhibits neutrophil elastase both in vitro and in vivo and has been successful in treating the pulmonary but not the liver manifestations of α-1-antirypsin deficiency, and adults with cystic fibrosis in a small clinical study.21-23 From our previous experience with immunoaffinity depletion (ID) of plasma for MS analysis it was not surprising to observe peptides arising from proteins that the ID column was directed against.
PMC3235251	D09000	Lastly, phosphatidylinositol-glycan specific phospholipase is an intracellular phospholipase responsible for the generation of second messengers from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) most notably inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate (IP4).42-44 Its significance in male plasma is entirely unknown but it appeared in all 5 plasma samples and was significantly increased in the plasma units from male versus female donors.
PMC3235251	D11005	In addition, the role of proteases in acute organ injury and multiple organ failure have been suggested, and if correct, female plasma could more efficiently be used as part of resuscitation to augment factor V levels, to increase circulating anti-protease concentrations, and to potentially decrease indiscriminant alternative pathway activation of complement.

PMC3310785	A01005	Excluding the serum proteins from minor vitreous haemorrhage, 19 proteins were found to be differentially produced in PDR patients compared with normal subjects; 6 of these proteins have never been reported to be differentially expressed in PDR vitreous: N(G),N(G)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH 1), tubulin alpha-1B chain, gamma-enolase, cytosolic acyl coenzyme A thioester hydrolase, malate dehydrogenase and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP 1).
PMC3310785	D00002	Excluding the serum proteins from minor vitreous haemorrhage, 19 proteins were identified as differentially produced in the vitreous fluid of the PDR patients compared with the vitreous fluid of the normal subjects; 6 of these proteins have never been reported to be differentially expressed in the PDR vitreous: N(G),N(G)-dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH 1), tubulin alpha-1B chain, gamma-enolase, cytosolic acyl coenzyme A thioester hydrolase ( cytosolic acyl coenzyme A thioester hydrolase), malate dehydrogenase (malate dehydrogenase) and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1).
PMC3310785	D03006	Clusterin is also an important mediator of cell signalling; it can interfere with NF-κB, PI3 kinase, or MAP kinase signalling [32,33], which are associated with cell apoptosis and cell proliferation.
PMC3310785	D04000	Carbonic anhydrase (Carbonic anhydrase) has been identified by proteomic analysis in the vitreous humour from PDR patients; Carbonic anhydrase production was increased in the vitreous of diabetic retinopathy patients compared with the controls [7,8].
PMC3310785	D04002	The presence of Carbonic anhydrase was initially thought to be due to retinal haemorrhage and erythrolysis, but subsequent investigation demonstrated that Carbonic anhydrase is also actively involved in the progression of diabetic retinopathy; CA-1 expression leads to the activation of the contact system, the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, and promotes retinal vessel leakage and intraretinal edema via increased kallikrein activity [8].
PMC3310785	D04003	The mechanisms involved in the increasing production of Carbonic anhydrase and the value of Carbonic anhydrase to potential therapeutic targets require further investigation.
PMC3310785	D05001	It is noteworthy that four of them (DDAH, gamma-enolase, cytosolic acyl coenzyme A thioester hydrolase and malate dehydrogenase) are cellular enzymes, and their levels are all decreased in the vitreous of diabetic patients with PDR, but we do not know whether these changes represent primary causes or consequences of PDR.
PMC3310785	D05003	Decreased DDAH expression/activity is evident in disease states associated with endothelial dysfunction and is believed to be the mechanism responsible for the increase in methylarginine levels and the subsequent asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)-mediated endothelial nitric oxide synthase impairment [37,38].
PMC3310785	D05007	In addition, gamma-enolase has been found in different types of human cancer and is used as a marker for tumoural or cellular damage [41,42].
PMC3310785	D05008	Gamma-enolase is also used as a marker for neural damage and is a reliable marker for cellular stress during rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD)
PMC3310785	D05010	The changed expression levels of cytosolic acyl coenzyme A thioester hydrolase and malate dehydrogenase in the PDR vitreous could reflect the alterations in glucose and lipid metabolism [45,46].
PMC3310785	D05011	Moreover, acyl-CoA thioesterases are highly regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs)

PMC3314906	A00000	Glutathione S-transferase P1 1 (GSTP1) belongs to the multigene isozyme family involved in cellular response to oxidative stress and apoptosis.
PMC3314906	D03002	Specifically, GSTP1 can act as an endogenous inhibitor of c-Jun N-terminal kinase by interaction with its C-terminal end.24 Additionally, GSTP1 expression rises in response to oxidative stress or proinflammatory stimuli.10 Dramatic elevations of reactive oxygen species are reported in HF by hypertrophy and proinflammatory stimuli, indicating multiple cellular responses, such as DNA synthesis, transcription factor activation, and gene and protein expression alteration, in HF.25 These reasons may also explain why GSTP1 was an overall better predictor of LV function in HF than proBNP, because inflammatory processes in HF (associated with GSTP1) are likely to involve the entire myocardium independently of LVMI and atrial dilation, processes that evidently affect proBNP production.

PMC3317910	A00000	Cercarial elastase is the major invasive larval protease in Schistosoma mansoni, a parasitic blood fluke, and is essential for host skin invasion.
PMC3317910	A00001	Genome sequence analysis reveals a greatly expanded family of cercarial elastase gene isoforms in Schistosoma mansoni.
PMC3317910	A00002	This expansion appears to be unique to S. mansoni, and it is unknown whether gene duplication has led to divergent protease function.
PMC3317910	A01000	Profiling of transcript and protein expression patterns reveals that cercarial elastase isoforms are similarly expressed throughout the S. mansoni life cycle.
PMC3317910	A01001	Computational modeling predicts key differences in the substrate-binding pockets of various cercarial elastase isoforms, suggesting a diversification of substrate preferences compared with the ancestral gene of the family.
PMC3317910	A03002	This process is facilitated by secreted proteases.
PMC3317910	A03003	In Schistosoma mansoni, cercarial elastase is the predominant secreted protease and essential for host skin invasion.
PMC3317910	A03004	Genomic analysis reveals a greatly expanded cercarial elastase gene family in S. mansoni.
PMC3317910	A03005	Despite sequence divergence, SmCE isoforms show similar expression profiles throughout the S. mansoni life cycle and have largely similar substrate specificities, suggesting that the majority of protease isoforms are functionally redundant and therefore their expansion is an example of gene dosage.
PMC3317910	D00004	In other parasite species, along with most eukaryotes, gene duplication frequently results in either an altered or novel gene function, and there are several examples of this that specifically involve protease gene families, including the duplication and functional divergence of the cathepsin L family in the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica, and that of several aspartic proteases in the nematode Strongyloides ratti[29], [30].
PMC3317910	D01000	The expansion of the cercarial elastase gene family by gene duplication in S. mansoni appears to involve both an increase in gene dosage for a critical enzyme during a crucial life cycle stage transition—host skin invasion–and may also represent the emergence of a new function of a serine protease as an invasive enzyme.
PMC3317910	D03000	The zoonotic S. japonicum, the avian-specific schistosome species and the more distantly related liver flukes are reported to use papain-like cysteine protease, rather than a serine protease, to facilitate initial invasion of their respective hosts [10], [11], [29].
PMC3317910	D03001	Based on current genome data, the expansion of the cercarial elastase gene family coincides with increased selectivity of humans as the definitive host of S. mansoni.
PMC3317910	D03004	This model is further supported by the recent sequencing and publication of the S. haematobium genome, which identifies 6 cercarial elastase genes in this species [8].
PMC3317910	D03006	Further curation of the S. haematobium genome will allow for identification of additional full-length CE sequences, but the presence of both type CE1 and CE2b isoforms implies that amplification of the cercarial elastase gene family from the ancestral 2b gene is likely to have occurred prior to the divergence of the S. haematobium and S. mansoni lineages.

PMC3317910	I00007	In Schistosoma mansoni, the most of abundant of these is cercarial elastase (SmCE), an S1A serine protease named for its ability to digest insoluble elastin.
PMC3317910	I01000	Completion of the S. mansoni genome sequence revealed an expanded cercarial elastase gene family, including eight full-length genes.
PMC3317910	I01004	Multiple CE isoforms exist in the related species Schistosoma haematobium, including homologs of SmCE1a, 1b, 2a and 2b isoform types [7], [8] The expansion of this family appears to be limited to the human-specific schistosomes: Schistosoma japonicum encodes only a single cercarial elastase gene, and there is substantial evidence that this species, along with the avian-specific schistosomes, utilizes another class of protease in host invasion [7], [9]–[12].
PMC3317910	I02000	The expansion of the cercarial elastase gene family in S. mansoni, and the sequence divergence among isoforms, suggests two alternative evolutionary scenarios: that gene duplication has allowed for differential regulation or diversified substrate specificity, in order to facilitate multiple functions in host invasion; or that SmCE gene duplication directly enhances fitness by simply increasing the amount of protease present.
PMC3317910	M01000	Cercarial elastase genes for S. mansoni, S. haematobium and S. japonicum were identified by searching all three annotated genomes in the SchistoDB website (http://beta.schistodb.net) using the Gene Ontology (GO)
PMC3317910	M07005	To identify active protease in developing cercariae, the esterase procedures of Li et al for alpha-naphthylacetate (with and without sodium fluoride) and naphthol AS-D chloroacetate were performed at pH 8
PMC3317910	M07007	To definitively identify activity as due to the serine protease of cercariae, two chloromethyl ketone inhibitors were employed.
PMC3317910	M07008	The first is a known inhibitor of the protease, Z-AAPF-CMK (alyl-alyl-prolyl-phenyl-chloromethyl ketone), and the second is known not to inhibit the protease, Z-FPR-CMK (phenyl-prolyl-argyl-chloromethyl ketone)
PMC3317910	M07010	Sections were pre-incubated with inhibitors for one hour prior to initiation of the esterase reaction.
PMC3317910	R02001	SmCE is expressed as a zymogen and contains a short prodomain that must be removed in order for the protein to become active; moreover, SmSerpinQ, a serpin (serine protease inhibitor) with specificity against cercarial elastase provides additional post-translational regulation of protease activity [14], [20].
PMC3317910	R02006	In this way, only active protease (i.e., protease without a prodomain, or in complex with inhibitor) is biotinylated.
PMC3317910	R03003	Treatment with a general serine esterase stain led to distinct visual staining in both the acetabular cell bodies and the ducts leading from acetabular cells to the anterior end of developing larvae (Figure 2B).
PMC3317910	R03005	Pre-treatment with Z-AAPF-CMK, a known inhibitor of SmCE, abolished stain reactivity (Figure 1C), whereas treatment with Z-FPR-CMK, to which the SmCE is largely insensitive, had no effect on esterase staining (Figure 1D)
PMC3317910	R04004	While SmCE is predicted to have the basic α/ß fold common to all chymotrypsin-like serine proteases, there are several notable structural features that are largely unique to SmCE, as has been previously noted [22].
PMC3317910	R04006	In this regard SmCE resembles the structure of rat mast cell protease II
PMC3317910	R05001	In protease nomenclature, the position where the amino acid N-terminal to the scissile bond of the substrate binds the active site of the protease is referred to as the S1 pocket, and the next site is the S2, etc.

PMC3331586	D08004	In contrast to these studies, an increase in mRNA expression of fatty acid synthase has also been shown after 4 wk exercise training in subcutaneous fat (50), although this study did not look at translated fatty acid synthase protein and therefore emphasizes the need to demonstrate any functional changes with protein analysis.

PMC3346765	R07004	Receptor tyrosine kinases have been suggested as drug targets in cancer therapy but cancer cells tend to develop resistance to these therapeutics.

PMC3349588	R02000	With exception of cardiac troponin I and T, many known clinic markers for myocardial ischemia and several potential new biomarkers were detected in our study, such as aspartate aminotransferase (ASA), CK-MB, heart-type fatty acid-binding protein (H-FABP), lactate dehydrogenase B (LDHB), and myohemoglobin (MB) (Table ​(Table2).2).
PMC3349588	R02003	In addition, five additional proteins specific to heart or muscle were identified: cardiac alpha actin, isoform alpha-enolase of alpha-enolase (ENO1), phosphoglycerate mutase 2 (PGAM2), isoform M1 of pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2(PKM2) and isoform 8 of Titin.

PMC3349588	R03005	Four of these six proteins are glycolytic enzymes, including LDHB, Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, Glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, PGAM2, and two of them (gelsolin and isoform 8 of titin) are targets of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), which will be activated during myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury

PMC3358667	M03000	For each peptidase p ∈ 𝒫 we construct (based on data collected in MEROPS database) the frequency matrix Fp = (Fp)ij for i ∈ ℐ, j ∈ 𝒥. The value fijp is the frequency of amino acid  i on position  j in all cleavage events, in which p is involved.
PMC3358667	M03001	Exemplary frequency matrices for elastase and trypsin enzymes are presented in Figure ​Figure22.
PMC3358667	M04001	Then for any peptidase p ∈ 𝒫 we detect the cleavage event cutting given peptide sequence if it matches the consensus sequence well.

PMC3382506	A00001	The O-glycoproteome is differentially regulated in cells by dynamic expression of a subset of 20 polypeptide GalNAc-transferases (GalNAc-Ts), and methods to identify important functions of individual GalNAc-Ts are largely unavailable.
PMC3382506	A00005	We confirm that GalNAc-T2–directed site-specific O-glycosylation inhibits proprotein activation of the lipase inhibitor ANGPTL3 in HepG2 cells and further identify eight O-glycoproteins exclusively glycosylated by T2 of which one, ApoC-III, is implicated in dyslipidemia.
PMC3382506	D00002	It is our hypothesis that differential regulation of the expression of GalNAc-Ts in cells provides for a variable and dynamic O-glycoproteome, which has specific biological impact for protein functions such as serving as coregulator of proprotein convertase processing (20).

PMC3497446	D05005	The identification of the fibronectin binding proteins CadF (44) and FlpA (45) as well as the major antigenic protein Peb3 (61) and the serine protease HtrA (4) associated with C. jejuni OMVs would indicate further possible mechanisms for the adherence of OMVs to human IECs, which could lead to internalization of OMVs by receptor-mediated endocytosis.
PMC3497446	I02000	Rather than secrete virulence factors into the surrounding milieu, where they could be degraded by host proteases, many Gram-negative bacterial pathogens utilize outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) as a mechanism of delivering active proteins and other moieties into host cells (19).
PMC3497446	I03006	For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa OMVs have been shown to deliver multiple virulence factors, including β-lactamase, alkaline phosphatase, hemolytic phospholipase C, and the Cif toxin, directly into airway epithelial cells (10).

PMC3497446	R03003	The cytotoxicity of OMVs pretreated with either proteinase K or polymyxin B was similar to that of untreated OMVs and was not statistically different from the cytotoxic effect of live wild-type 11168H cells (MOI, 100:1) over 24 h.
PMC3497446	R04007	The host immune response induced by C. jejuni OMVs was not significantly reduced following pretreatment of OMVs with either proteinase K or polymyxin B (Fig.

PMC3521600	R05001	The Tree test required only a maximum of 3 proteins, cathepsin D, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and keratin 19, to differentiate between each cell group (Figure 6).
PMC3521600	R05003	Secondly fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase at greater than 18 spectral counts classified the cell line as HER2 positive while less than 18 spectral counts required a second protein, keratin 19, to further distinguish the remaining 2 groups.

PMC3542882	D03002	The present results showed that some proteins linked to glycolysis and pyruvate metabolism, such as enolase (α, γ, and β-enolase), and pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2, are less expressed in engineered vessel walls as compared with that in native ones.
PMC3542882	D03003	Pyruvate kinase is a rate-controlling enzyme of the glycolytic cascade, which catalyses the formation of pyruvate and ATP from phosphoenol pyruvate and ADP.37
PMC3542882	D03004	In addition, enolase, which is composed of three distinct subunits (α, β, and γ), is an abundant glycolytic enzyme present in vascular tissues.38 Based on these studies, we speculate that upregulation of these proteins would accelerate glucose metabolism and the energy production, resulting in an increased number of metabolic active SMCs.
PMC3542882	D03005	Consequently, further work should be done to investigate whether increased expression of enolase and pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 could serve as reliable biomarkers indicating an active metabolic status of engineered vascular tissues constructed in the bioreactor.

PMC3578717	I01013	Therefore, these biochemical tests sometimes lack specificity because they cannot differentiate between the alpha-amylase 1 (present in saliva) and alpha-amylase 2 (present in semen and vaginal secretion)
PMC3578717	R02000	By means of mass spectrometry, semenogelin 1 and 2 but also other semen-specific proteins such as prostatic acid phosphatase and PSA were found (Fig. 2).
PMC3578717	R03000	Vaginal biomarkers are cornulin, involucrin, and cornifin while alpha-amylase 1 is the highly abundant and specific protein for saliva.
PMC3578717	R03001	By means of mass spectrometry, a distinction between the two forms of alpha-amylase (alpha-amylase 1, present in saliva and alpha-amylase 2, present in semen and vaginal secretion) can be made, thus increasing specificity.

PMC3582525	D03003	EIF3K has been shown to be involved in apoptosis regulation by interacting with the subsequent liberation of caspase 3 into the cytosol[48].
PMC3582525	D03005	In the cytoplasm, the liberated caspase 3 is known to cleave the Rho-GDI-Rac-GDP complex resulting in Rac activation, which is the first reaction for the cell apoptotic function[49].
PMC3582525	D04001	GST and GTPase Ran were also down-regulated in HCV-infected samples.
PMC3582525	D04004	The up-regulated caspase 3 cleaves the Rho-GDI-Rac-GDP complex resulting in Rac activation, which is the first step that leads to apoptosis[50].

PMC3582525	D06002	Conversely, the down-regulation of GST and GTPase Ran might be due to the HCV infection.
PMC3582525	D06003	In addition, we observed that the protein, ER ATPase, a protein that is involved in ER-associated degradation pathway[51], was down-regulated in HIV-1 mono- and HIV-1/HCV co-infected samples but up-regulated during HCV mono-infection, indicating an inflammatory immune response in HCV infection and immune suppression in HIV-1 infection.

PMC3582525	R02004	The remainder of the down-regulation changes identified occurred in two proteins, the glycolytic protein pyruvate kinase (spot 5) and the ER ATPase (spot 7).
PMC3582525	R03001	We also identified an ER ATPase (spot 7) that was up-regulated by 7.85-fold (Figure​(Figure3).3).
PMC3582525	R03003	We also observed uniquely expressed spots for HCV corresponding to a protein similar to prostaglandin E synthase 3 (spot 20), DPYSL3 (dihydropyrimidinase-like 3) (spot 21), DPYSL4 (spot 22), nucleoside diphosphate kinase A (spot 23), thioredoxin (spot 24), a protein highly similar to CBP2 (spot 25), and malate dehydrogenase, mitochondrial (MDH2; spot 26) as located in the 2D gel and identified by LC/MS/MS analysis.
PMC3582525	R04001	We also demonstrated that HCV infection induced a decreased PBMC expression of the cell synthesis of CBP2 (spot 6), which was down-regulated by 4.05-fold; the metabolic protein GST (spot 8); the cell growth protein GTPase Ran (spot 10); and Rho-GDI, which was down-regulated by 2.84-fold (Figure​(Figure4).4).
PMC3582525	R05005	The co-infection of HIV-1/HCV led to the down-regulation of cytoskeletal protein tropomyosin alpha-4 isoform 1 (spot 1), the glycolytic protein pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2 (spot 5), an ER ATPase (spot 7), the anti-apoptosis and apoptosis regulator enzyme GST (spot 8), EIF3K (spot 9–2.57-fold), the cell growth protein GTPase Ran (spot 10), the chaperone HSP90-beta (spot 11–2.77-fold), and the stress-induced phosphoprotein 1 (STIP-1) (spot 13–2.82-fold).
PMC3582525	R05006	Since, tropomyosin alpha-4 isoform 1, pyruvate kinase isozymes M1/M2, ER ATPase, and STIP-1 were down-regulated in HIV-1 and HIV-1/HCV infection but not in HCV-infected PBMC, their down-regulation is likely related to the presence of HIV-1 infection.

PMC3626295	A02001	The proteolytic cleavage sites in TGFBIp from the diseased cornea are in accordance with the activity of serine protease HtrA1.
PMC3626295	A02002	We also identified small amounts of the serine protease kallikrein-14 in the amyloid deposits.
PMC3626295	A03001	The proteomic data suggest that the sequence 571-YHIGDEILVSGGIGALVR-588 contains the amyloid core of the FAS1–4 domain of TGFBIp and point at serine protease HtrA1 as the most likely candidate responsible for the proteolytic processing of amyloidogenic and aggregated TGFBIp, which explains the accumulation of HtrA1 in the amyloid deposits.
PMC3626295	A03002	With relevance to identifying serine proteases, we also found glia-derived nexin (protease-nexin 1) in the amyloid deposits, making this serine protease inhibitor a good candidate for the physiologically relevant inhibitor of one of the amyloid-associated serine proteases in the cornea and probably in other tissues.
PMC3626295	D00003	Significantly, the study reveals that serine protease HtrA1 is a major component of the corneal amyloid deposits and proteolytic cleavages in TGFBIp from the diseased cornea are in accordance with the activity of serine protease HtrA1.
PMC3626295	D01002	However, the serine protease HtrA1 is relatively much more abundant, and apolipoprotein E is less abundant in the amyloid samples from the A546D mutant cornea.
PMC3626295	D01004	Based on the relative abundances, we conclude that TGFBIp, serum amyloid P-component, apolipoprotein A-IV, clusterin, and serine protease HtrA1 are enriched in the amyloid deposits while clusterin, apolipoprotein A-IV, phospholipase A2, apolipoprotein D, serum amyloid

PMC3626295	D05006	[59], while Truebestein et al. showed that this protease cleaves substrates with L, V, A, T, M, S, I, Q, and E in the P1 position with a decreasing preference
PMC3626295	D05009	[61] show that the protease has no immense preference for specific residues at the P1 position but rather recognizes and cleaves unstructured hydrophobic sequences.
PMC3626295	D05014	Based on our present results and those obtained from another variant of LCD type 1 caused by homozygous mutation V624M in TGFBI [4], we suggest that serine protease HtrA1 cleaves partly unfolded mutant TGFBIp in the soluble state (periamyloid tissue) but also tries to remove the insoluble TGFBIp amyloid aggregates, which explains the accumulation of serine protease HtrA1 in the deposits.
PMC3626295	D05015	However, we also identified small amounts of serine protease kallikrein-14 in the amyloid deposits.
PMC3626295	D05018	However, further investigations are required to confirm that amyloidogenic mutant TGFBIp, and specifically the FAS1–4 domain, is a substrate for serine proteases HtrA1 and kallikrein-14 under physiological conditions in vitro.
PMC3626295	D05019	The fact that the serpin glia-derived nexin (protease-nexin 1) was found in the amyloid deposits suggests that it is involved in regulating the proteolytic processing of the TGFBIp amyloid and makes glia-derived nexin a good candidate for the physiologically relevant inhibitor of one of the amyloid-associated serine proteases in the cornea and probably in other tissues.
PMC3626295	D05020	Glia-derived nexin inhibits serine proteases cleaving at basic residues and, therefore, most likely regulates the proteolytic activity of kallikrein-14 in vivo.

PMC3626295	I02007	In conclusion, the accumulation of serine protease HtrA1 in the amyloid lesions and identification of numerous proteolytic cleavage sites in TGFBIp consistent with HtrA1 activity strongly support our previous observations, suggesting that HtrA1 is involved in the proteolytic processing of amyloidogenic TGFBIp in the cornea [4].
PMC3626295	M06006	Since the trypsin preparation (Promega, Madison, WI) cleaves exclusively C-terminal to Arg or Lys residues and has shown no chymotrypsin activity [13], proteolytic events producing semitryptic peptides are likely the result of endogenous proteases.

PMC3631612	D05000	Similarly, the comparative proteomic analysis using 2D-DIGE analysis showed for the first time that the human pre-nodal lymph is characterized by an enriched set of proteins such as: alpha-1-antitrypsin, annexin A1, alpha-tubulin, cystatin A, BAI-1 associated protein 2, calmodulin-like protein, caspase 14, C-type lectin domain family 3, desmoglein-1, fatty acid binding protein, gelsolin, glutathione S-transferase, pepsin-like aspartate protease, S-100 A9 Ca2+ binding protein, and vitamin D binding protein.

PMC3654532	D01004	Interestingly, several differentially expressed proteins identified in this model system were also detected in the current serum proteomic study, including fructose-bisphosphate aldolase A, apolipoproteins A-I and E, and multiple proteins involved in acute phase and inflammatory responses.
PMC3654532	D02001	For example, fumarylacetoacetase, an enzyme predominantly expressed in the liver that is essential for tyrosine metabolism, was significantly elevated in DILI patients compared with controls, correlated with ALT, AST and alkaline phosphatase, and was also identified as the only priority 1 protein with significantly higher expression in patients with hepatocellular vs. mixed pattern of injury.
PMC3654532	D02002	Type I tyrosinaemia, a genetic disorder characterised by fumarylacetoacetase deficiency and systemic accumulation of tyrosine, is strongly associated with liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma.40 Indeed, the significant upregulation of fumarylacetoacetase expression in patients with hepatocellular DILI suggests a compensatory mechanism in response to accumulation of tyrosine and/or other toxic metabolites, including fumarylacetoacetate, induced by hepatotoxic agents.
PMC3654532	D02003	Fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B, a hepatic enzyme involved in glucose and fructose metabolism, was significantly greater in patients with DILI compared with controls and in patients with hepatocellular DILI vs. cholestatic DILI, and was identified as an independent correlate of both serum ALT and AST elevations.

PMC3654532	D02005	These associations may provide an explanation for the previously demonstrated detection of serum autoantibodies to fructose-bisphosphate aldolase B in patients with troglitazone-induced hepatotoxicity41 and support the concept that expression levels of this enzyme may correlate with extent of liver injury.

PMC3654532	R02002	Expression of only one protein, fumarylacetoacetase, was different among patients with hepatocellular and mixed DILI, and there were no differentially expressed proteins when comparing the cholestatic and mixed DILI groups.

PMC3680184	D03001	lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase is the most abundant protein in the CSF and serves two roles: 1) synthesis of prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) from prostaglandin H2 (PGH2); and 2) binding and transporting small lipophilic molecules.
PMC3680184	D03002	lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase alterations have been reported in a number of sleep disorders including narcolepsy and obstructive sleep apnea with and without daytime sleepiness [24-26] and thus its increase is relevant to sleep disruptions in RLS/WED.
PMC3680184	D03006	It has been reported that lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase is upregulated in the brains of subjects with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE)

PMC3708178	A00005	Unexpectedly, this proteinase was immunodetected by the serum of male trichomoniasis patients but not by the female patient serum or sera from healthy men and women.
PMC3708178	D00001	Because iron plays a critical role in host-parasite relationships and in the general physiology of the parasite (26) in the female microenvironment, modulating several pathogenic properties, such as adhesin synthesis (27), protease expression (28), and the expression of crucial metabolic enzymes (26), it seems plausible to infer that in the male microenvironment, Zn2+ might has a crucial role as well.
PMC3708178	D04002	In contrast, six isoforms of actin, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, putative lactate dehydrogenase, and putative adenosine triphosphatase were up-regulated (26).
PMC3708178	D05000	Interestingly, putative cysteine and metallopeptidases were identified as immunogenic molecules.
PMC3708178	D05002	T. vaginalis expresses several proteinases that participate in many parasitic functions such as trichomonal adherence (31–33), cytotoxicity (17–18, 25, 33), host colonization, hemolysis (34), immune evasion (35–36), signal transduction, nutrient acquisition (34, 37), complement resistant and apoptosis induction (38–39).
PMC3708178	D05003	Moreover, papain-like cysteine proteinases have been described as virulence factors in this parasite (17, 32, 40).
PMC3708178	D06000	Among the immunogenic proteins, we identified a 50-kDa metallopeptidase of clan MG (TvMP50), which presented an expression level increase of 0.5-fold in the HGMN01 isolate in the presence of Zn2+ whereas it was 1.0-fold in the CNCD147 isolate.
PMC3708178	D06002	Unexpectedly, this metallopeptidase was immunorecognized by the male trichomoniasis patient serum but not by the female patient serum.

PMC3708178	D08002	Two of them (142 kDa and >220 kDa) were reported by Bozner and Demes, and the activity of these metallopeptidases is inhibited in the presence of 2 mm EDTA (42).
PMC3708178	D08003	Another reported metalloproteinase is a 47-kDa peptidase from the trichomonad hydrogenosome, the hydrogenosomal processing peptidase (hydrogenosomal processing peptidase).
PMC3708178	D08004	hydrogenosomal processing peptidase contains an active site motif (HXXEHX76E) characteristic of the β subunit of the mitochondrial processing peptidase.
PMC3708178	D08005	Interestingly, hydrogenosomal processing peptidase forms a homodimer (100 kDa) in vitro and in vivo (43).
PMC3708178	D08006	The fourth metallopeptidase reported is a 50-kDa proteinase that was up-regulated in the presence of Zn2+ in a female T. vaginalis isolate (16).
PMC3708178	D08007	However, in the present study, we demonstrate the presence of this metallopeptidase in a male T. vaginalis isolate.
PMC3708178	D08008	Interestingly, we found a 50-kDa-proteolytic activity band in the HGMN01 and CNCD147 T. vaginalis isolates that might correspond to the previously reported metallopeptidase (16).
PMC3708178	D08010	TvMP50 was inhibited by EDTA but not by cysteine or serine proteinase inhibitors such as TLCK, E-64, leupeptin, or PMSF.
PMC3708178	D08012	Bozner and Demes activated the proteinases at pH 8.2 (42), whereas we activated them at pH 7.5 because at the basic pH of 8.2, the activity of TvMP50 was not observed.
PMC3708178	D08013	A pH of 7.5 has previously been reported for the activation of metallopeptidases (24).
PMC3708178	D09000	Peptidases with at least two metal ions in the active site are a structurally heterogeneous group.
PMC3708178	D09002	Clan MG metallopeptidases, such as the methionine aminopeptidases, have the pita-bread fold and contain two cobalt or two manganese ions in their active centers (44).To identify the residues involved in catalysis, the TvMP50 sequence was aligned with other members of the peptidase clan MG, including aminopeptidase P (Ec_MER001244) and Xaa-Pro dipeptidase (Ec_MER001250) from Escherichia coli.
PMC3708178	D09004	These results suggest that TvMP50 has an active-site configuration similar to other members of the peptidase clan MG.
PMC3708178	D09005	According to the alignment analyses, TvMP50 might be classified as an aminopeptidase of the clan MG.
PMC3708178	D10000	According to the crystal structures of E. coli methionyl aminopeptidase and aminopeptidase P (APP) (45–46), TvMP50 might have diverse metal requirements.

PMC3708178	D13002	When T. vaginalis is in contact with vaginal epithelial cells (VECs), the parasite releases α-enolase (tvENO1) but at the same time, it is present on the parasite surface, most likely as an adhesion molecule, suggesting its role as a virulence factor (57).
PMC3708178	D13003	Previously, it had been reported as a T. vaginalis enolase family protein (including putative enolase 3 and enolase 4) (58); however, enolase 2 was not included.
PMC3708178	D13004	Although enolase 2 is down-regulated by Zn2+, this molecule was immunorecognized by the male trichomoniasis patient serum in the present study.
PMC3708178	D13005	Furthermore, Whiting and colleagues reported that 15 of 22 patients with proven Streptococcus pneumoniae infection have antibodies to α-enolase, suggesting its important role in natural immunity to S. pneumonia (59).
PMC3708178	D17000	The energy metabolism of parasites may include the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase, such as Entamoeba histolytica in which the pyruvate, the end-product of carbohydrate catabolism by glycolysis, is oxidatively decarboxylated by pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase) (65), transferring the electrons produced during pyruvate oxidation to ferredoxin, whereas acetyl-CoA is consecutively reduced to acetaldehyde and ethanol (under microaerophilic conditions), mainly via the activity of a bifunctional NADH-dependent aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase (EhADH2) or to ethanol and acetate (under aerobic conditions) via the latter and acetyl-CoA synthetase (ADP-forming) (65–68).
PMC3708178	D17001	Interestingly, the expression levels of alcohol dehydrogenase 2 (EhADH2) and alcohol dehydrogenase 3 (EhADH3) are higher in a virulent versus nonvirulent amoebae (69).
PMC3708178	D17004	In T. vaginalis, the alcohol dehydrogenase activity is related to metronidazole-resistance.
PMC3708178	D17007	Drug-resistant T. foetus also increases activity of the cytosolic NADP-dependent malic enzyme to enhance the pyruvate producing bypass and provide the NADPH required by alcohol dehydrogenase (71).
PMC3708178	D17008	Interestingly, two alcohol dehydrogenases were immunorecognized by the male trichomoniasis patient serum in the present study, but their expression levels did not change in the presence of Zn2+.
PMC3708178	D17009	Because the alcohol acetaldehyde dehydrogenase from Listeria monocytogenes (LAP) is a pathogenic factor, promoting bacterial adhesion to intestinal epithelial cells by interacting with mammalian receptor Hsp60 (72–75), it could be possible that this type of enzymes might induce a host immune response.

PMC3772042	D00001	These features are largely executed through well characterized virulence factors such as cysteine proteases (gingipains), fimbriae, lipopolysaccharide, capsule, and hemagglutinins that exert their effects through direct interactions with the host [49,55].

PMC3772042	D03000	It has been proposed that secretion or shedding of microbial proteinases within the autophagosome is one mechanism by which P. gingivalis subverts the autophagic response [27].
PMC3772042	D03001	This theory is based on evidence of increased proteolysis of long-lived endogenous proteins of HCAEC infected with P. gingivalis, and microscopic evidence of P. gingivalis shedding secretory vesicles presumed to be rich in proteinases while the bacterium is residing within late autophagosomes [57].
PMC3772042	D05008	Madrigal et al. have recently demonstrated that Kgp gingipain disrupts intracellular kinases that act as downstream effectors of Toll-like receptor (TLR), TNF-α, and Nod-like receptor (NLR) mediated production of cytokines [61].

PMC3780806	D00002	Specifically, the tumor-associated protease cancer procoagulant is secreted from numerous malignancies including colorectal cancer into the bloodstream [21].
PMC3780806	D01008	This demonstrates that the cleavage of CP-RP and the accumulation of CP-AP is a specific reaction that is related to cysteinprotease activity.

PMC3862442	R04007	Some of these still had highly significant Blastp E-values to a human protein, e.g. the P. falciparum kinases listed in Table 2, since a short region of high similarity in two otherwise disparate proteins can return a high local alignment score (in the case of the P. falciparum kinases, this region is the catalytic domain).
PMC3862442	R06005	The orthologues of the kinases PF13_0166 and CDPK7 (PF11_0242) have been suggested to be essential in P. berghei (Tewari et al., 2010).
PMC3862442	R06006	In T. gondii, the orthologue of the apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (PF13_0176) has been shown to essential by conditional knockout (Onyango et al., 2011) and GAP40 (PFE0785c) is part of the essential glideosome complex, though the protein itself has not been verified as essential (Frenal et al., 2010).
PMC3862442	R08003	One of these, dihydropteroate synthetase (DHPS; PF08_0095) is one of the very few validated targets of clinically used antimalarials, consistent with the value of our approach for identifying essential targets.
PMC3862442	R08007	For the kinases in the list a slightly modified approach was taken, as many kinase inhibitors are well known to be cross reactive against multiple kinases.
PMC3862442	R08008	An empirical cut-off of 30% local sequence identity in the kinase domains was therefore used to identify homologues for potential inhibitors of from the TDR/ChEMBL data (Table 3).
PMC3862442	R10002	These could be differences in sequence, as is the case with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Satchell et al., 2005) or in regulation, as demonstrated for dihydrofolate reductase (Zhang and Rathod, 2002).
PMC3862442	R10008	We are confident that this set contains promising leads because it includes known targets such as dihydropteroate synthetase (PF08_0095), the target of sulfonamides (dihydrofolate synthetase is not included because it is 20% identical to human mitochondrial tetrahydrofolylpolyglutamate synthase, EC 6.3.2.17), and enzymes of the non-mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid synthesis.
PMC3862442	R10009	Another potential target in the apicoplast could be stromal processing peptidase (PF14_0382), which has already been characterized in P. falciparum (van Dooren et al., 2002).
PMC3862442	R10010	Investigational targets identified include glutamate dehydrogenase C (PF08_0132) (Aparicio et al., 2010; Storm et al., 2011) and Ca2+-dependent protein kinases (PF11_0239, PF11_0242) (Kato et al., 2008; Ojo et al., 2010; Lim et al., 2012).
PMC3862442	R10011	In addition, there are enzymes which are being targeted in other systems, e.g. apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease (PF13_0176) (Tell et al., 2010) or telomerase reverse transcriptase (PF13_0080) (Chen et al., 2009) by antitumor agents, or phosphomannose isomerase (MAL8P1.156) by antifungals.
PMC3862442	R10013	A surprising find in the list of candidate targets was phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PF14_0246), the enzyme responsible for carbon fixation in C4 plants.
PMC3862442	R10015	If this process is essential, PEP carboxylase could be an attractive target since inhibitors have been identified as C4 plant herbicides (Madhusudana et al., 1980; Jenkins, 1989;
PMC3870977	D06001	The activated fibrinogenase in the fibrinolytic system enters into the blood in large quantity, which will cause the increase of FDP in serum.
PMC3905668	A00004	However, the kinase that directs the phosphorylation of Gag p6 toward virus replication remains to be identified.
PMC3905668	A00005	In our present study, we identified this kinase using a proteomic approach and further delineate its role in HIV-1 replication.
PMC3905668	A01000	A proteomic approach was designed to systematically identify human protein kinases that potently interact with HIV-1 Gag and successfully identified 22 candidates.
PMC3905668	A01001	Among this panel, atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) was found to phosphorylate HIV-1
PMC3905668	A02000	Our current results indicate for the first time that HIV-1 Gag phosphorylation on Ser487 is mediated by aPKC and that this kinase may regulate the incorporation of Vpr into HIV-1 virions and thereby supports virus infectivity.

PMC3905668	I01002	Concomitant with, or after these viral particles pinch off and are released from the host cell via budding, the virus-encoded protease becomes activated and cleaves Gag into its functional subdomains, matrix (MA, p17), capsid (CA, p24), and nucleocapsid (NC, p7), as well as several shorter segments: SP1 (spacer peptide 1), SP2, and p6.
PMC3905668	I05000	In our current study, we utilized an in vitro high-throughput protein-protein interaction assay using full-length HIV-1 Gag and host protein kinases synthesized by the wheat germ cell-free protein production system in an attempt to identify the kinase (s) that directs the phosphorylation of Gag p6 to promote virus replication.
PMC3905668	I05001	We here report that atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) is a functional interactor of HIV-1 Gag and facilitates viral infectivity by promoting the incorporation of Vpr into virions.
PMC3905668	M04000	A total of 287 cDNAs encoding human protein kinases were constructed as described previously [23].
PMC3905668	M05002	For each protein kinase, 1 μl of crude recombinant biotinylated construct from the human kinase library was incubated with 1 μl of crude GST-Gag or GST-DHFR in 10 μl of kinase assay buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl pH8.0, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.1% Tween20, 0.1% BSA) at 37°C for 1 h in one well of a 384-well Optiplate (Perkin Elmer, Foster City, CA.
PMC3905668	M14001	In experiments using kinase inhibitors, cells were treated with each inhibitor at 12 h before virus infection.
PMC3905668	R00000	Our initial goal was to identify host kinases that phosphorylate the HIV-1 Gag protein.
PMC3905668	R00001	Because Gag phosphorylation is important for its functional role, we focused on human protein kinases as potential Gag regulators.
PMC3905668	R00002	We synthesized more than 287 full-length protein kinases using a wheat germ cell-free protein production system, and screened them for their association with Gag with the amplified luminescent proximity homogenous assay (AlphaScreen)
PMC3905668	R00005	Full-length Gag and human protein kinases were synthesized using a wheat germ cell-free system and subjected to an AlphaScreen assessment.
PMC3905668	R00006	The binding efficiency of HIV-1 Gag with each kinase was normalized relative to the luminescent activity of a control DHFR protein (Figure 1B).
PMC3905668	R00007	When a relative light unit per cutoff (RLU/Co) ratio of ≥ 3.0 was used as the threshold, we found that 22 host kinases could selectively interact with HIV-1 Gag and thus were identified as primary kinase candidates for the phosphorylation of HIV-1 Gag (Figure 1B).
PMC3905668	R01002	Interestingly, we further found that the aPKC family kinases, PKCζ and PKCι, could interact with HIV-1 Gag at a relatively high score (S/N = 3.57 and 3.19, respectively).
PMC3905668	R03002	Recombinant GST-Gag or GST proteins were expressed and purified from wheat germ cell-free extract by glutathione sepharose beads and used as substrates for in vitro kinase assays.
PMC3905668	R05001	Subsequent in vitro kinase assay results demonstrated that GST-p6 is phosphorylated by aPKC, but not GST-p6-S487A
PMC3905668	R06004	293T cells were transfected with V5 tagged wild type aPKC or a kinase-negative mutant (aPKC-Kn), together with wild type Gag-Pol.
PMC3905668	R07007	Conventional PKC (PKCα, PKCβ), Akt, CDK and PI3 kinases have been reported previously to affect HIV-1 replication through their phosphorylation of HIV-1 or of host proteins [3,24,27-30].
PMC3905668	R07008	We thus also investigated using specific inhibitors whether these kinases could mediate the phosphorylation of HIV-1 Gag at Ser487.
PMC3905668	R11000	To further explore the relevance of Gag phosphorylation to HIV-1 replication, we examined whether aPKC kinase activity is necessary to regulate Vpr incorporation into HIV-1 virions.
PMC3905668	R11001	Gag phosphorylation at Ser487 was prominently enhanced by wild type aPKC but not kinase negative mutant aPKC (Kn) (Figure 5D).

PMC3959865	I01001	This is especially important because lung cancer patients with activating mutations in EGFR demonstrate dramatic sensitivity to EGFR targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (8, 9), such as gefitinib (ZD1839, Iressa, AstraZeneca) and erlotinib (OSI-774, Tarceva, Genentech) (10, 11).
PMC3959865	I01002	These compounds inhibit the downstream activity of the EGFR axis by competitively inhibiting ATP binding in the catalytic core of the kinase domain of EGFR.
PMC3959865	I02000	To bridge this gap, we first assessed the broad protein network effects of inhibiting EGFR kinase with gefitinib in an epidermoid cancer cell line (A431) that over-expresses EGFR.
PMC3959865	R00004	The dose of 100 nM gefitinib inhibits EGFR phosphorylation (IC50 40 – 80 nM) while minimizing suppression of other kinases (for example, the IC50 for HER2 is 1,200 – 3,700 nM) (29).

PMC3972748	R04001	In contrast, in AMS·R no or minimal difference in Prdx-6 (no change) or glutathione peroxidase (0.4-fold increase) protein abundance was observed, whereas QSOX1 appeared to decline in response to hypobaric hypoxia (1.5-fold decrease).

PMC3972748	R06000	One explanation for the rise in Prdx-6 [2.3-fold (LTQ-XL)], glutathione peroxidase [1.9-fold (FT)], and QSOX1 [2.8-fold (LTQ-XL)] abundance from preascent to 9 h in AMS relates to their role as redox-sensitive antioxidants.
PMC3972748	R06001	In other words, a hypoxia-associated rise in Prdx-6, glutathione peroxidase, and QSOX1 abundance may act to compensate for elevated hypoxia-induced oxidant production in individuals who develop AMS relative to those who do not.
PMC3972748	R06007	Correspondingly, the lack of change in Prdx-6 and glutathione peroxidase with hypobaric hypoxia in AMS·R may reflect comparatively reduced, but not absent, hypoxia-induced oxidant production relative to AMS.
PMC3972748	R09003	It was recently proposed that the effect of redox status to modulate HIF1α activity is dependent, in part, on the duration of oxidant exposure such that ROS (H2O2) induce HIF1α in the short term but repress HIF1α activity and the expression of prolylhydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) after prolonged exposure (38).

PMC4003525	A00002	Using biochemical and proteomic approaches to identify MLC1 interactors and elucidate MLC1 function we found that MLC1 interacts with the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), the proton pump that regulates endosomal acidity.
PMC4003525	A00003	Because we previously showed that in intracellular organelles MLC1 directly binds Na, K-ATPase, which controls endosomal pH, we studied MLC1 endosomal localization and trafficking and MLC1 effects on endosomal acidity and function using human astrocytoma cells overexpressing wild-type (WT) MLC1 or MLC1 carrying pathological mutations.
PMC4003525	D03000	The identification of vacuolar ATPase and Na, K-ATPase, also known to regulate early endosome pH, as proteins interacting with MLC1 (this study and Brignone et al., 2011, respectively) led us to hypothesize a role for MLC1 in the control of organelle pH.
PMC4003525	D03005	A similar behavior has been described for the Na, K-ATPase which exerts an essential role in the maintenance of the slightly acidic pH typical of early endosomes in which it is localized (Cain and Murphy, 1988; Cain et al., 1989; Feldmann et al., 2007; Grabe and Oster, 2001) and whose direct interaction with MLC1 has been demonstrated by our group (Brignone et al., 2011).
PMC4003525	D03006	Future experiments will aim to clarify the exact mechanisms through which MLC1 can influence endosomal pH and the molecular and functional relationships between MLC1 and vacuolar ATPase.

PMC4003525	I03000	In initial experiments aimed at identifying MLC1 protein interactors and MLC1-associated functional pathways, we found that MLC1 interacts with the vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), the proton pump responsible for endosomal acidification (Forgac, 2007).
PMC4003525	I03001	This finding and the observation that in rat primary astrocytes and human astrocytoma cells MLC1 binds the Na, K-ATPase which, among other functions, controls early endosomal pH (Brignone et al., 2011; Lanciotti et al., 2012), prompted us to investigate the possible role of MLC1 in organelle acidification and protein trafficking and the effects of MLC disease-associated pathological mutations on these pathways.
PMC4003525	R00001	Among the potential MLC1 interactors identified (manuscript in preparation), we found that 2 subunits (a1 and B2) of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase), the proton pump responsible for endosomal acidification (Forgac, 2007), were pulled-down by His-MLC1 in 2 out of 3 experiments (Table 1).
PMC4003525	R00002	In the same experiments we also detected the alpha and beta subunits of the Na, K-ATPase pump (Table 1), thus confirming the results obtained in rat astrocytes and human astrocytoma cells using the yeast two-hybrid system and biochemical assays (Brignone et al., 2011; Lanciotti et al., 2012).
PMC4003525	R00003	Because Na, K-ATPase, besides controlling plasma-membrane potential and cell volume, is also involved in the regulation of endosomal pH (Fuchs et al., 1989), these findings suggested that MLC1 might play a role in this process.
PMC4003525	R10000	MLC1 interaction with proteins involved in the regulation of organelle acidification, like V-ATPase and Na, K-ATPase, and the high levels of expression of MLC1 in early and recycling endosomal compartments support the idea of a possible involvement of MLC1 in endosomal function and modulation of organelle acidity.

PMC4119355	A00003	Based on concordance in statistical significance and confirmatory results obtained from analysis of both serum and plasma, we identified eleven proteins associated with muscular dystrophy, among which four proteins were elevated in blood from muscular dystrophy patients: carbonic anhydrase III (CA3) and myosin light chain 3 (MYL3), both specifically expressed in slow-twitch muscle fibers and mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2) and electron transfer flavoprotein A (ETFA).
PMC4119355	D02003	This allows not only for detection of proteins expected to be in plasma, such as CA3 with an average concentration of approximately 10 ng/ml (Mokuno et al, 1985; Ohta et al, 1991) or creatine kinase with a reference limit around 3–5 ng/ml (Apple et al, 2003), but presumably also for analysis of leakage products (Anderson & Anderson, 2002) from the muscle tissue.
PMC4119355	D03007	In comparison with these proteins, levels of creatine kinase, which has been used for confirmation of diagnosis of muscle wasting diseases for several decades (Mendell et al, 2012), were also found to be increased in patients, but with less degree of concordance and statistical significance, yet still supporting the technical validity of our approach.
PMC4119355	D05003	Interestingly, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors have shown to have positive effects in animal models of dystrophinopathies, suggesting they might be potentially explored for human therapy (Giacomotto et al, 2009).
PMC4119355	D05005	CA3 is expressed in few tissues and therefore considered to be a more specific and sensitive marker for muscular dystrophies in comparison with creatine kinase, which is more ubiquitously expressed (Shima, 1984; Väänänen et al, 1988; Harju et al, 2012).
PMC4119355	D05006	creatine kinase abundance into the blood does not correlate with deterioration of specific muscle fibers upon tissue damage (Shima, 1984; Osterman et al, 1985; Väänänen et al, 1988), whereas CA3 does.
PMC4119355	D05010	Studies in healthy individuals showed that CA3 is accumulated into the blood as a consequence of skeletal muscle injury (Väänänen et al, 1990; Brancaccio et al, 2010) and vigorous physical exercise (Takala et al, 1989) in a similar way as creatine kinase.
PMC4119355	D06001	In contrast, ETFB, interacting with ETFA to build a complex involved in electron transfer from mitochondrial flavin-containing dehydrogenases to the respiratory chain, showed an opposite trend.
PMC4119355	D07000	Abundance of three serum proteins MMP9, metalloproteinase inhibitor 1 (TIMP1), and fibronectin (FN1) has very recently been shown to correlate with disease progression in patients affected by muscle dystrophy (Brancaccio et al, 2010; Nadarajah et al, 2011; Martin et al, 2014).
PMC4119355	D07001	In addition, potential protein markers for treatment outcome were identified in mdx mice plasma, for example, the coagulation Factor XIIIa (FXIIIa), leukemia inhibitory factor (LIFr), glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPX3), apolipoprotein E α (ApoE α), and β actins (ApoE β) (Alagaratnam et al, 2008;

PMC4119355	R04001	These two proteins together with creatine kinase, MDH2, and ETFA were main contributors for separating NMD patients and healthy controls in the UNIFE cohort (Fig ​(Fig2A)2A) and together with only MDH2 for the clustering of DMD serum samples and aged matched healthy donors in the LUMC cohort (Fig ​(Fig2B).2B).
PMC4119355	R08000	The comparison across DMD, BMD, and control groups revealed three more potentially interesting proteins, TNNT3, creatine kinase, and ETFB (also summarized in Table ​Table2).2).
PMC4119355	R11003	Particularly, the levels of MYL3, ETFA, and MDH2 revealed a strong decrease with age as compared to CA3, TNNT3, and creatine kinase (Supplementary Table S3).
PMC4119355	R13003	In addition to these three proteins, PPM1F (protein phosphatase 1F), COL6A1 (collagen alpha-1(VI) chain), and LCP1 (plastin-2) also contributed for the separation between ventilated and non-ventilated patients.

PMC4158146	D00002	According to the molecular and functional data for these proteins, they can be classified into several groups: kidney secretory and structural proteins: uromodulin (formerly Tamm-Horsfall protein), vesicular integral-membrane protein (VIP), gelsolin, and actin cytoplasmic 1 and 2, basement membrane-specific heparin sulphate proteoglycan core protein; serum constitutional and transport proteins: albumin, vitamin D binding protein, leucine-rich α2 glycoprotein, transthyretin, plasma retinol-binding protein, haptoglobin Β chain, ubiquitin, α-1 acid glycoprotein 1, and tumor protein D52; coagulation factors: fibrinogen α chain, kininogen-1, fibrinogen β chain, fibrinogen γ chain, CD59 glycoprotein, and antithrombin-III; complement fractions: mannan-binding lectin serine protease, immunoglobulins with heavy and light chains, secreted and transmembrane protein 1, protein AMBP, and transmembrane and immunoglobulin domain-containing protein 1; proteases and inhibitors: α1 antitrypsin and α1 antitrypsin fragment, α1 antichymotrypsin, and inter-α trypsin inhibitor heavy chain H4; enzymes: prostaglandin-H2-isomerase, alpha-amylase 1, thymidine phosphorylase, endonuclease domain-containing 1 protein, quinone oxidoreductase-like protein 1, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase rififylin, and Ras-related protein Rab-36; metal binding proteins: serum transferrin, α-HS-glycoprotein, and zinc-α-2-glycoprotein; transcriptional regulators: U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 18 and interleukin enhancer-binding factor 2; and lipoprotein metabolism: apolipoprotein.
PMC4158146	D02000	Thirty-four proteins in our study have been reported as constituents of the normal urine, while 11 proteins (antithrombin-III, alpha-amylase 1, U3 small nucleolar RNA-associated protein 18 homolog, thymidine phosphorylase, endonuclease domain-containing 1 protein, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase rififylin, quinone oxidoreductase-like protein 1, interleukin enhancer-binding factor 2, transmembrane and immunoglobulin domain-containing protein 1, Ras-related protein Rab-36, and Tumor protein D52) were not reported in the normal urine proteome [7].
PMC4158146	D02001	Of them, thymidine phosphorylase, E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, and tumor protein D52 are involved in processes of angiogenesis, tumor growth, or metastasis and the rest are proteins with different physiological functions and no reported involvement in cancer development or progression.

PMC4225696	A00000	Serine hydrolases constitute a large enzyme family involved in a diversity of proteolytic and metabolic processes which are essential for many aspects of normal physiology.
PMC4225696	A00001	The roles of serine hydrolases in renal function are largely unknown and monitoring their activity may provide important insights into renal physiology.
PMC4225696	A00002	The goal of this study was to profile urinary serine hydrolases with activity-based protein profiling (ABPP) and to perform an in-depth compositional analysis.
PMC4225696	A01002	Active serine hydrolases were isolated with affinity purification and identified on MS-MS.
PMC4225696	A01004	A complementary 2D LC/MS-MS analysis was performed to evaluate the composition of serine hydrolases in urine.
PMC4225696	A02001	Affinity purification and MS/MS identified 13 active serine hydrolases.
PMC4225696	A02003	Complement C1r subcomponent-like protein, mannan binding lectin serine protease 2 and myeloblastin (proteinase 3) were also identified in active forms.
PMC4225696	A02004	The in-depth compositional analysis identified 62 serine hydrolases in urine independent of activity state.
PMC4225696	A03001	Additional serine hydrolases were identified in an active form that may contribute to regulating innate immunity of the urinary tract.
PMC4225696	D00004	This study also provides a unique in-depth activity and compositional analysis of serine hydrolases in normal urine.
PMC4225696	D00005	Serine hydrolase activity frequently, but not invariably, correlates with total protein, thus emphasizing the need for functional proteomic characterization.
PMC4225696	D00006	Interestingly, three active esterases were identified that have limited functional characterization and no previously specified role in the urine, and these may be important targets for further analysis.
PMC4225696	D00007	Equally importantly, we identified active serine proteases involved in key renal physiological processes and innate immunity, and these are discussed below.
PMC4225696	D02001	Calcium is actively reabsorbed in the distal convoluted tubule through the apical transient receptor potential channel vanilloid subtype 5 (TRPV5), transported through the cytosol by calbindin-D28K, and then basolaterally transported via the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger and Ca2+ ATPase transporters [19].
PMC4225696	D02002	Luminal tissue kallikrein stimulates calcium reabsorption by activating the B2 receptor, which results in protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent phosphorylation of TRPV5 [19].
PMC4225696	D03002	Furthermore, tissue kallikrein inhibits potassium reabsorption in intercalated cells by decreasing H+/K+-ATPase expression and activity, resulting in a net kalliuretic effect [20].
PMC4225696	D03003	Importantly, luminal tissue kallikrein demonstrated inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase activity by 70%, whereas basolateral tissue kallikrein had no effect [20].
PMC4225696	D05000	Kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK3), or prostate specific antigen, is located on the same gene locus as tissue kallikrein (KLK1), however its function relates primarily to the liquefaction of semen to allow sperm to move freely, and has no known renal physiological functions.
PMC4225696	D06000	Urokinase-type plasminogen activator cleaves the zymogen plasminogen into plasmin, a serine protease.
PMC4225696	D06004	However, the increased sensitivity of ABPP and mass spectrometry techniques utilized in our study permitted the identification of both plasmin and urokinase-type plasminogen activator in healthy individuals.
PMC4225696	D09000	Several of the serine hydrolases detected with ABPP have been shown to be involved in innate immunity.
PMC4225696	D09001	Mannan-binding lectin serine protease 2 (MASP2) participates in activating the lectin pathway of the complement cascade when MASP2 cleaves C4 [29,30].
PMC4225696	D09002	Complement C1r subcomponent-like protein (C1r-like protease), homologous to C1r, participates in activating the classical complement pathway via cleavage of pro-C1s [31].
PMC4225696	D09003	The role of C1r-like protease in complement-mediated functions is still unclear with suggestions of both activating and inhibitory roles [31,32].
PMC4225696	D09004	Proteinase 3 acts in concert with neutrophil elastase to promote neutrophil activation by cleaving and inactivating the anti-inflammatory progranulin [33].
PMC4225696	D09005	Furthermore, proteinase 3 has been demonstrated to process human cathelicidin-18 into the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 [34].

PMC4225696	I01006	Members of the serine hydrolase family share a serine centric charge relay system in their catalytic site and this common feature can be exploited with an activity-based probe to selectively label active serine hydrolases.
PMC4225696	I02000	The serine hydrolase family is one of the largest enzyme classes in humans and constitutes ~1% of predicted protein products from the eukaryotic genome.
PMC4225696	I02001	Serine hydrolases consist of greater than 100 serine proteases and approximately 110 esterases, lipases, peptidases and amidases [10].
PMC4225696	I02002	While some members are well-characterized (e.g. trypsin, elastase, thrombin, acetylcholinesterase), many have yet to be described [10].
PMC4225696	I02003	Indeed the role for ~50% of the non-serine proteases remains undetermined [10], and very little is known about the presence and role of serine hydrolases in the urine of healthy individuals.
PMC4225696	I02004	Therefore the objective of this study was to evaluate the activity and composition of serine hydrolases in normal urine.
PMC4225696	I03000	Thirteen serine hydrolases were identified in an active form in normal urine that may reflect regulation of renal electrolyte homeostasis and innate immunity of the urinary tract.
PMC4225696	I03001	The in-depth compositional analysis identified 62 serine hydrolases in normal urine independent of activity state.
PMC4225696	M01000	Serine hydrolase ABPP was optimized in normal urines with FP-TAMRA (2 μM)
PMC4225696	M01001	[ActivX FP-TAMRA serine hydrolase probe, Catalogue 88318, Thermo Fisher Scientific USA] at different pH, temperature and reaction times.
PMC4225696	M02001	Urinary serine hydrolase activity was found to be stable for up to 5 freeze thaw cycles.
PMC4225696	M03001	The concentrated sample (200 μl) was labeled with 2 μM FP-TAMRA probe [ActivX FP-TAMRA serine hydrolase probe, Catalogue 88318, Thermo Fisher Scientific USA] at pH 9, 37°C for 90 minutes.
PMC4225696	M06003	The 2D LC-MS/MS data of normal urinary proteins (n = 1846) were annotated against a list of serine hydrolases (n = 244) described by Cravatt et al.[8] and 4 other serine hydrolases identified in Uniprot.
PMC4225696	M06004	Serine hydrolases identified with high confidence GPM log10 (expectation) scores of less than -3 (n = 62) derived from this annotated list were used to generate Table 1.
PMC4225696	R00000	Initial studies were undertaken to determine if there was evidence of serine hydrolase activity in normal urine.
PMC4225696	R00001	Urines were reacted with a fluorophosphonate probe tetramethylrhodamine (FP-TAMRA) which detects a broad range of serine hydrolase activities independent of the specific reactions that these enzymes catalyze.
PMC4225696	R02000	The FP-TAMRA labeled proteins in normal urine were affinity purified with an anti-TAMRA antibody [11] and analyzed by mass spectrometry as an approach to identifying the specific active serine hydrolases in normal urine.
PMC4225696	R03000	Thirteen active serine hydrolases were identified by MS/MS following the in-gel or in-solution digestion.
PMC4225696	R04000	The presence of serine hydrolase activity in normal urines was directly assessed by incubating the urines (n = 18) with one specific substrate and monitoring for the generation of a reaction product.
PMC4225696	R04001	Evidence of carboxyl ester lipase (bile salt-activated lipase) activity was demonstrated using 4-nitrophenol palmitate as substrate (Figure 4)
PMC4225696	R04003	The presence of kallikrein-1 (tissue kallikrein) and urokinase activity was demonstrated using the [D] Val-Leu-Arg-paranitronilide substrate (Figure 4)
PMC4225696	R04005	Collectively, these results confirmed the presence of several serine hydrolase activities in normal urine.
PMC4225696	R05000	Although the previous results identified the presence of active urinary serine hydrolases it was apparent that not all of the FP-TAMRA labeled species were isolated by affinity purification (Figure 3).
PMC4225696	R05001	Therefore, a 2D LC-MS/MS analysis of pooled healthy urine samples (n = 4) was undertaken as an alternate approach to determining the serine hydrolase composition of normal urine.
PMC4225696	R05002	The goal was to characterize the overall normal urinary serine hydrolase population; therefore pooled urines were utilized for biological averaging in lieu of individual biological replicates.
PMC4225696	R05003	A total of 1846 urinary proteins were identified and these lists were annotated to identify all the potential serine hydrolases.
PMC4225696	R05004	A total of 62 serine hydrolases were identified with high confidence GPM log10 (expectation) scores of less than -3 (Table 1).
PMC4225696	R06000	Twelve of the thirteen active serine hydrolases identified with ABPP affinity purification were present on the 2D LC-MS/MS compositional analysis (Table 2).
PMC4225696	R06002	Notably, myeloblastin (proteinase 3) appeared to be a low abundance protein [log10 (-5.9)] and plasma kallikrein was only detected with ABPP affinity purification, which supports the successful isolation of low abundance active proteins.
PMC4225696	R06003	Finally, several high abundance serine hydrolases (vitamin-K dependent protein Z, tripeptidyl-peptidase 1, complement factor I light chain) were not identified with ABPP affinity purification.
PMC4225696	R06004	Taken together, these data suggest that the active serine hydrolases identified were not due to non-specific binding of high abundance enzymes.
PMC4244100	A00010	Some blood proteins, such as flavin reductase (which converts biliverdin to bilirubin), were detected only in the HCV group.
PMC4244100	R03000	With regard to HCV infection, one of the specific proteins identified was flavin reductase (IPI IPI00783862), an oxidoreductase that catalyzes NADPH-dependent reduction and in the liver, converts biliverdin to bilirubin.
PMC4244100	R03002	Patients with HCV may experience increased oxidative stress due to the activation of NADPH oxidase, increased production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS)/reactive nitrogen species (RNS), decreased antioxidants, iron overload and increased cytokines [20], [21].
PMC4244100	R04001	As expected, the majority of the detected peptides in all of the fractions correspond to alpha-amylase or serum albumin.
PMC4244100	R08006	A possible explanation for these elevations is that a necroinflammatory hepatic status can release iron and ferritin from damaged hepatocytes, a process also sustained by the concomitant high serum levels of serum alanine aminotransferase.
PMC4259987	D07015	Interestingly, a number of proteases as well as protease inhibitor enzymes are correlated with MMSE scores (Table 3; SERPINs F1 and G1, CST3, PCSK1N, B3GNT1) suggesting a direct role in cognitive function.
PMC4259987	F41001	Secretory sorting receptors carboxypeptidase E and secretogranin III in amyloid beta-associated neural degeneration in Alzheimer's disease.
PMC4277649	A00006	Different enzyme systems (trypsin; chymotrypsin; trypsin/chymotrypsin; proteinase K; pronase E; and pronase E/leucine aminopeptidase/prolidase) were evaluated for their proficiency of digestion of SA modified with PhIP.
PMC4277649	A01005	The specificity and efficiency of several different proteases toward the digestion of the SA-Cys34-PhIP adduct were examined.

PMC4277649	F24002	Mass spectrometric investigation of the mechanism of inactivation of hamster arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 by N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene.
PMC4277649	I02004	The formation of these arylamine adducts with N-acetyltransferase has also been inferred by MS analysis of the intact protein; however, these adducts likewise undergo hydrolysis during proteolysis [23–26].
PMC4277649	I04002	Proteases of different specificities can digest proteins to polypeptide chains of different lengths.
PMC4277649	I04003	Combinations of several proteases can further break down proteins to smaller peptides or even monoamino acids, and different digestion strategies have been employed for digestion and quantification of proteins [29–31].
PMC4277649	I04004	However, the adduction of a bulky carcinogen to a protein can impact the efficacy of a protease, resulting in the occurrence of missed-cleaved peptides.
PMC4277649	I04005	For example, SA adducts of HAAs, therapeutics, acetaminophen, mustards or lipid peroxidation products formed at the Cys34 residue undergo digestion with pronase, trypsin, or a combination of trypsin and chymotrypsin to produce C*PF, ALVLIAFAQYLQQC*PFEDHVK, LQQC*PF, or missed cleavage peptide LQQC*PFEDHVK
PMC4277649	I05000	The goals of our study were to establish a robust method to measure the arylsulfinamide adduct of PhIP formed with Cys34 of human SA, following its conversion to the stable arylsulfonamide structure, and to examine the proficiencies of different proteases to recover PhIP-adducted Cys34 peptides for measurement by ion trap MS.
PMC4277649	M01006	Sequence grade trypsin and chymotrypsin were purchased from Promega (Madison, WI), and biochemical grade trypsin, chymotrypsin, proteinase K, pronase E, leucine aminopeptidase, and prolidase were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO).
PMC4277649	M06000	Pronase E digestion: PhIP-modified SA (5 μg, 75 pmol) in 50 μL 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) containing1 mM CaCl2 was treated with pronase E at a protease: protein ratio of 1:2 and 1:10 (w/w) for 20 h at 37 °C, followed by adduct enrichment with SPE
PMC4277649	M07000	Pronase E/leucine aminopeptidase/prolidase digestion: PhIP-modified SA (5 μg, 75 pmol) in 50 μL 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) containing MnCl2 (1 mM) and CaCl2 (1 mM) was treated with pronase E at a protease:protein ratio of 1:2 (w/w), leucine aminopeptidase at a protease: protein ratio of 1:30 (w/w), and prolidase at a protease:protein ratio of 1:8 (w/w).
PMC4277649	M08000	Proteinase K digestion: PhIP-modified SA (5 μg, 75 pmol) in 50 μL 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) was digested with proteinase K at a protease:protein ratio of 1:20 (w/w).
PMC4277649	R00006	In this study, we have examined the proficiency of digestion of the SA-Cys34 adducts of PhIP with pronase E, or a mixture of pronase E/leucine aminopeptidase/prolidase, proteinase K, chymotrypsin, and by treatment with trypsin/chymotrypsin.
PMC4277649	R01000	The major PhIP peptide adducts recovered from the different proteases are reported in Table 1.
PMC4277649	R01001	The digestion of the m-CPBA-oxidized PhIP-SA with pronase E produced the QC*PF sulfonamide as the major adduct rather than the fully digested C* (C-[SO2]-PhIP) sulfonamide).
PMC4277649	R01004	The C*PF sulfonamide adduct, along with only minor amounts of C*P and C* sulfonamide adducts, was also detected following proteolytic digestion with a 3-enzyme mixture containing pronase E, leucine aminopeptidase, and prolidase (Fig. S-2).
PMC4277649	R02000	Adduction products of mustards, acrylamide, and acetaminophen formed at the Cys34 of human SA are also resistant toward enzymatic hydrolysis and recovered principally as C*PF or QC*PF, following digestion with pronase [3,32,39].
PMC4277649	R02001	QC*PF was the predominant adduct of PhIP recovered with proteinase K, but the signal was much lower than the signal obtained from any of the other proteases.
PMC4277649	R03001	The corresponding chromatograms of the MS ion signals for major peptide adducts recovered from the different proteases are shown in Fig.
PMC4277649	R03004	The intensity of the LQQC*PFEDHVK (C-[SO2]-PhIP) signal obtained from trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion of SA was 10-fold or greater than the signal of the PhIP peptide adducts recovered following digestion of SA with other proteases (Fig. 4).
PMC4277649	R04005	These data signify that the charge state and not matrix effects are responsible for the high ionization efficiency and elevated response of the LQQC*PFEDHVK (C-[SO2]-PhIP) sulfonamide adduct over the singly protonated C*-[SO2]-PhIP adducts, and thereby explains the large differences in response of signals of the different PhIP peptide adducts obtained by digestion of SA with different proteases (Fig. 4).
PMC4277649	R05001	The stability of LQQC*PFEDHVK: LQQC*PˆFEDHVK (4.5 pmol, 1:1) toward the different proteases (trypsin, trypsin/chymotrypsin, pronase E, or pronase E, leucine aminopeptidase and prolidase) was examined by employing the same quantities of enzymes that were used for the digestion of PhIP-modified SA (5 μg) described above.
PMC4277649	R05002	The abilities of the different proteases to digest the 1-missed cleaved tryptic/chymotryptic peptide (C-[SO2]-PhIP) sulfonamide homologues were assessed by isotopic data-dependent scanning and monitoring mass to charge differences set at m/z 6.0, 3.0, or 2.0, respectively, for singly, doubly, or triply charged peptide species.
PMC4277649	R05004	In contrast, the unlabeled and the labeled (C-[SO2]-PhIP) sulfonamide peptide did undergo digestion with elevated levels of chymotrypsin, or by digestion with pronase E, or by treatment with pronase E/leucine aminopeptidase/prolidase to produce the same smaller peptides observed in the different proteolytic digests of PhIP-modified SA(Table 1).

PMC4357084	I03003	The enolase of Paracoccidioides is a surface associated protein that promotes an increase in the adhesion and invasion of the fungus to host cells in in vitro models of infection [10,44,45].

PMC4357084	I04002	Proteins of the glycolytic pathway, such as phosphoglycerate kinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase) were identified; the last was selected for further characterization.
PMC4357084	I04003	fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase has been described in various microorganisms as a Plg-binding protein, but its role has not been described in thermally dimorphic fungi.
PMC4357084	I04004	Here we show that Paracoccidioides binds Plg via fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, that is found at the surface and secreted by the fungus.
PMC4357084	I04007	The addition of recombinant fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (rFBA) or anti-rFBA antibodies was capable of reducing the interaction between macrophages and Paracoccidioides, possibly by blocking the binding sites for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase.
PMC4357084	I04008	These data reveal the possible participation of the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase in the Paracoccidioides adhesion and invasion processes.
PMC4357084	M05000	The cDNA that encodes fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase of Paracoccidioides, Pb01 (GenBank Accession Number AY233454) was previously obtained [69].
PMC4357084	M05007	fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase linked to GST (glutathione-S-transferase) was affinity purified using glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare).
PMC4357084	M06006	The membranes were incubated with the secondary antibody anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma Aldrich) diluted 1:5000 in blocking buffer, for 1 h. After that, the membranes were washed and the reaction was developed using 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) and Nitro Blue Tetrazolium (NBT).
PMC4357084	M11001	The yeast cells were also incubated with the serine proteinase inhibitors aprotinin (1 μg), PMSF (50 mM) and with anti-rFBA antibodies in a final volume of 1 mL. Thereafter, the mixtures were washed three times with PBS and the pellets were placed in wells of a fibrin substrate matrix gel.
PMC4357084	M12006	The membrane was incubated blocking buffer [PBS 1X with 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20] for 2 h, and then successively with anti-rFBA polyclonal antibodies (1:1000) and with the anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Sigma Aldrich).
PMC4357084	R02003	Several enzymes were detected in this category, some of them presenting several isoforms, such as homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (spots 4,5), NADP-specific glutamate dehydrogenase (spots 6,7), phosphoglycerate kinase (spots 8,16) 2-methylcitrate synthase (spots 9,10,11), fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (spots 13,14,15) and malate dehydrogenase (spots 20,21).
PMC4357084	R03001	The proteins: 2-methylcitrate synthase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, formamidase, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase and phosphoglycerate kinase were detected in the secretome of Paracoccidioides, Pb01 yeast and mycelia
PMC4357084	R03003	Other proteins were identified in the secretome of Paracoccidioides, Pb18: fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and phosphoglycerate kinase [49].
PMC4357084	R04001	In this way, acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase was identified in the bacteria Leptospira interrogans [50]; phosphoglycerate kinase was described in C. albicans [40], Streptococcus pneumoniae [51], as well as in C. neoformans [15].
PMC4357084	R04002	In addition, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase were also described as Plg-binding proteins in C. albicans [40].
PMC4357084	R06000	The proteomic binding assays, also allowed the identification of enolase as a Plg-binding protein.
PMC4357084	R06002	In Paracoccidioides, enolase is present at the yeast cells surface, where it binds and activates hPlg, presumably contributing to the fungus pathogenesis [10].
PMC4357084	R06003	Other glycolytic enzymes, such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, were found here as Plg-binding proteins (Figure 1B, Table 1).
PMC4357084	R06004	Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase), is a molecule that binds Plg and is present on the surface and secretome of bacteria [56-58] and fungi [40].
PMC4357084	R06007	In studies conducted by our group, Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase is located at the surface of Paracoccidioides, where could mediate the adhesion and internalization of the fungus to host cells, binding to ECM components [62].
PMC4357084	R07000	Phosphoglycerate kinase is an adhesin in both, bacteria [63] and fungi [15,40].
PMC4357084	R07001	On the surface of group B streptococcus, phosphoglycerate kinase binds the host actin and Plg.
PMC4357084	R07002	Binding of ECM components to bacterial proteins, including phosphoglycerate kinase, promotes the activation of specific proteins on its surface, which induces bacterial adhesion [63,64].
PMC4357084	R07003	Also, proteolytic degradation of ECM by phosphoglycerate kinase - recruited plasmin activity, promotes adherence to endothelial cells and bacterial dissemination in the host tissues [36].
PMC4357084	R07004	In C. neoformans, phosphoglycerate kinase localizes to the fungal cell wall, where exhibits accessible carboxyl-terminal lysine residues for Plg-binding [65].
PMC4357084	R08000	fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase is cytoplasmic and also localized at the surface of several bacteria [66,67], as well as in pathogenic fungi [15,40] where it binds host molecules and depicts adhesin function, beyond its glycolytic activity.
PMC4357084	R08001	In this work, three isoforms of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase were detected (Table 1, spots 13, 14 e 15).
PMC4357084	R08002	The fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase of Paracoccidioides, Pb01 was previously characterized in our laboratory [68,69].
PMC4357084	R08004	Studies revealed the role of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase in cell adhesion and invasion [67].
PMC4357084	R08006	In C. neoformans, analysis of the Plg-binding proteins, allowed the identification of a fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase surface protein, that serves as a Plg receptor [15].
PMC4357084	R08007	So, due to the relevance of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase as an adhesin and a Plg-binding protein that promotes the virulence of microorganisms, the protein was selected for further investigation in Paracoccidioides.
PMC4357084	R09000	We selected fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase for further analysis, since the protein is a Plg-binding protein in several pathogens, as previously described [15,40,70].
PMC4357084	R09001	To verify if the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase of Paracoccidioides also has this ability, a recombinant protein was obtained by cloning the cDNA (GenBank Accession Number AY233454) into the expression vector pGEX-4 T-3 (GE Healthcare) as described in Material and Methods.
PMC4357084	R09004	A Far-western blotting with increasing concentrations of rFBA was obtained, and depicted in Figure 2B. Concentrations of 0.1 μg to 3 μg of the recombinant protein were subjected to Far-western, demonstrating a dose-dependent binding of the protein with Plg, showing that, in fact, the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase of Paracoccidioides binds to the Plg.
PMC4357084	R10000	In order to determine the localization of the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase in Paracoccidioides, Pb01, we performed a western blotting with cellular fractions of Paracoccidioides and polyclonal antibodies raised in mice to the recombinant protein.
PMC4357084	R10001	As shown in Figure 3A, the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase is present in the cytoplasm, secretome and cell wall (fractions 1 and 2).
PMC4357084	R10006	Furthermore, the immunoelectron microscopy analysis revealed the presence of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase in the cytoplasm, in vesicles in releasing process and at the cell surface, as depicted in Figure 3B, panel 2.
PMC4357084	R10009	The presence of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase at the surface and vesicle of the fungus can allow the capture of hPlg and plasmin generation, forming a highly fibrinolytic layer around the fungal cell.
PMC4357084	R10010	These data suggest that fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, can somehow influence fibrinolytic activity of yeast cells.
PMC4357084	R11000	We next investigated whether the capture of Plg by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, favors the generation of plasmin.
PMC4357084	R12007	Thus, we can conclude that fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase of Paracoccidioides may have an important role in the host tissues invasion by the fungus, besides participating in metabolic processes.
PMC4357084	R12009	By capturing and activating Plg, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase can promote the spread of the fungus, certainly by matrix degradation, paving the way for infection toward internal organs.
PMC4357084	R13004	Next, we investigated the putative role of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase in the interaction between Paracoccidioides and macrophages.
PMC4357084	R13007	The data strongly suggest a role for the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase in the infective process in macrophages.
PMC4357084	R14000	Similar experiments with other proteins such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and triose phosphate isomerase, that promoted reduced interaction of Paracoccidioides with pneumocytes and Vero cells, were reported [62,76].
PMC4357084	R14003	This data is consistent with the role of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase in activating Plg to plasmin, as previously demonstrated in Figure 4C.
PMC4357084	R14004	Our data suggest that binding of the fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase to Plg, may increase the virulence of this pathogen.

PMC4358004	A00005	The morphology of the ΔenvC deletion mutant was identical to that of the wild-type strain, but it showed a drastic reduction of periplasmic proteins, including the chaperones HtrA, SurA, and Skp, and an accumulation of β-barrel-containing outer membrane proteins comprising the autotransporters Hap, IgA serine protease, and HMW2A, as observed by proteomic analysis.
PMC4358004	D02001	This observation was quite surprising considering the essential role played by E. coli EnvC in amidase activation (27).
PMC4358004	D02003	Indeed, NTHI EnvC could modulate the activity of other proteases involved in peptidoglycan cleavage, as reported for EnvC in E. coli (14, 27).

PMC4358004	I00001	The fundamental role of metalloproteases in bacterial physiology prompted many researchers to select them as potential vaccine antigens and to test their protective capability in order to develop new vaccines (5,–7).
PMC4358004	I01000	Metalloproteases can be recognized by the presence of a short conserved signature sequence containing histidine and glutamate residues.
PMC4358004	I01001	The most common motif is HEXXH (zincins), but other motifs, such as HXXEH (inverzincins), HXXE (carboxypeptidase family), and HXH (e.g., lysostaphin-like), have also been reported (2).
PMC4358004	I01002	Lysostaphin-like metalloproteases (LytM proteins) belong to the M23 peptidase family and are found in bacteriophages and in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
PMC4358004	I01009	It has been reported that these LytM proteins are potent and specific activators of PG hydrolysis by the amidases (16).
PMC4358004	I02000	Although LytM metalloproteases are well characterized in E. coli and in other bacteria, not much information is available about their role in Haemophilus influenzae.
PMC4358004	R00000	By bioinformatic analysis, we identified three ORFs present in the NTHI 176 strain genome sequence that contain canonical features of LytM bacterial metalloproteases.
PMC4375882	A02001	One of these proteins, receptor tyrosine kinase Axl, was significantly increased in RIA, as confirmed in CSF from the discovery cohort as well as in CSF and plasma from the validation cohort (p <0.05).

PMC4375882	R02002	Axl, a tyrosine kinase receptor, which displayed a unique increase in the CSF of RIAs, was annotated as an N-linked glycoprotein in the database.
PMC4390597	D04005	The 9 serum biomarkers (alpha1 antitrypsin, apolipoprotein C-III, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, cortisol, epidermal growth factor, myeloperoxidase, prolactin, resistin, and soluble tumor necrosis factor alpha receptor type II) were selected from the proteins of biochemical domains associated with MDD.
PMC4390597	I02001	Studies of the postmortem brain, especially the frontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, found expressional changes in dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2, carbonic anhydrase, and aldolase C. This finding suggests that brain development and energy metabolism may be associated with depression.18,19 A recent study on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex also found associations between MDD, energy metabolism, and synaptic function.20 However, these studies had limitations, namely that the investigations were done only in a limited brain area.
PMC4396075	D00001	These articles cited poor negative predictive values of dipstick tests (57-76%), measuring nitrite, leukocyte esterase (Leukocyte esterase), and hemoglobin levels.
PMC4396075	D00006	In five cases with K. pneumoniae as the infectious agent, nitrite-inducible formate dehydrogenase, nitrite reductase, nitrite extrusion protein 1, and subunits of nitrate reductase 1 and NADPH-dependent nitrite reductase were quite abundant in the bacterial proteome.
PMC4396075	D00007	In contrast, the agreement of the results obtained from Leukocyte esterase assays, which detect inflammation in the urinary tract and are reported to suffer from poor specificity (70-72%)
PMC4396075	D00009	Determining neutrophil protein content in UP samples and setting the threshold for inflammation at 30%, only 7 of 60 samples had a Leukocyte esterase assay score of less than 2+.
PMC4396075	D00011	Three proteolytic enzymes produced by azurophilic and specific neutrophil granules, ELANE, PTRN3, and cathepsin G, were consistently among the 50 most abundant proteins in proteomic profiles of UP samples with an Leukocyte esterase assay score of 3+.
PMC4396075	D00013	An Leukocyte esterase assay score of 1+ may account for poor specificity considering that 6 of 11 cases with this score revealed the presence of Lactobacillus and 3 cases low quantities of UPEC, suggesting colonization rather than UTI in these patients.
PMC4396075	D02007	While we could not differentiate cases of UTI and ASB (data on clinical symptoms were unavailable), we identified three cases where low neutrophil-derived inflammation and low Leukocyte esterase scores coincided with strong proteomic evidence of urethral colonization by a pathogen.
PMC4396075	D03002	The NAD score assesses inflammation with specificity results comparable to those observed with the Leukocyte esterase assay and microscopic counts of leukocytes.
PMC4396075	D03005	We described a set of sample clusters (NAD1 clusters) highly enriched for neutrophil granules proteins, including protein S100-A8, protein S100-A12, myeloperoxidase, ELANE, defensin-1, LTF, and cathepsin G.
PMC4396075	D03006	The protein profiles also had increased quantities of histones which, together with myeloperoxidase and ELANE, are the antibacterial effectors in neutrophil extracellular traps [48].
PMC4396075	I02002	Dipstick UA tests estimate the quantities of protein, blood, nitrite and leukocyte esterase (Leukocyte esterase) in a patient’s urine sample.
PMC4396075	I02005	The leukocyte count and Leukocyte esterase activity score are the principal measures of inflammation.
PMC4396075	M01003	To be selected for proteomic analysis, urine specimens had to meet two of three score thresholds: nitrite concentration ≥ 1+; Leukocyte esterase activity ≥ 1+ (each measured by dipstick tests); bacteria ≥ 1+ in urine sediments (assessed by microscopy).
PMC4396075	M02003	For the detection of leucocyte esterase, 3-(N-Toluenesulfonyl-L-alanyloxy)indole is used for colorimetric measurements [21].
PMC4396075	R02003	The 35 proteins included five functional groups: the calcium-binding S100 family proteins S100-A8, S100-A9, and S100-A12 which contribute 40-50% of the total cytosolic protein content in neutrophils; proteins released during inflammation from neutrophil granules, including myeloperoxidase (myeloperoxidase), cathepsin G (CTSG), defensin-1 (DEFA1), elastase (ELANE), lysosome (LYZ), lactotransferrin (LTF), and cathelicidin (CAMP)
PMC4396075	R02004	[31]; proteins implicated in the formation, trafficking, and fusion of granules with phagolysosomes, including grancalcin (GCA), plastin-2 (LCP1), annexin A3 (ANXA3), and tetraspanin (CD63 antigen); proteins influencing neutrophil migration in the milieu of a reorganizing extracellular matrix, such as integrin αM/β2, gelatinase (MMP9), and neutrophil collagenase (MMP8); and NADPH oxidase, an enzyme with multiple subunits including cytochrome b-245 (CYBA, Figure 3) located in the membrane of phagolysosomes of phagocytic cells and responsible for the oxidative burst that directly kills pathogens.
PMC4396075	R02009	Eosinophil peroxidase (Eosinophil peroxidase) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) both of which are also effectors of the response towards pathogens were an order of magnitude less abundant than neutrophil-derived proteins, thus not supporting a major role of eosinophils in the inflammatory response.
PMC4396075	R03001	Figure 2 includes Leukocyte esterase scores ranging from negative (N) to trace (T), 1, 2, and 3 for each sample.
PMC4396075	R03002	Overall, a strong correlation of neutrophil protein abundances and Leukocyte esterase scores is observed.
PMC4396075	R03003	The Leukocyte esterase score measures leukocyte esterase activity, likely representing primarily elastase (ELANE) and myeloblastin (PRTN3), two neutrophil proteases quantified for eight samples in Figure 3.
PMC4396075	R03004	All profiles on the left side of the graph (Figure 2) and fifty-three of the 60 samples with more than 30% (iBAQ) neutrophil protein content had Leukocyte esterase scores of 2 or 3.
PMC4396075	R03005	Twenty-nine of the 40 samples with less than 23% (iBAQ) neutrophil protein content had Leukocyte esterase scores ranging from negative to 1.
PMC4396075	R03006	In only four of eleven cases where the Leukocyte esterase score was ≥ 2, but the neutrophil protein content was relatively low, the microscopic leukocyte count was greater than 11 cells per high power field (HPF), a threshold used to define pyuria.
PMC4396075	R03008	In summary, assessing neutrophil content in urine sediments via proteomics appears to be at least as accurate as the Leukocyte esterase assay to diagnose inflammation in the urinary tract.
PMC4396075	R03009	It measures the sum of abundances of 35 proteins enriched in neutrophils and may be less susceptible to false positive results compared to the Leukocyte esterase assay.
PMC4396075	R04002	Summed abundances of 32 red blood cell proteins, including hemoglobin subunits, band 3 anion transport protein, band 7 integral membrane protein, and carbonic anhydrase-1, relative to total protein content in each UP sample were determined, shown by the green bar segments of the plot displayed in Figure 2.
PMC4396075	R04004	There was no evidence of a good correlation of either NAD scores or Leukocyte esterase assay results with ERY scores, suggesting that, even in the cases of detection of a pathogen (shown by the coloration of the horizontal bar at the bottom of the plot in Figure 2), neutrophil infiltration of the urinary tract does not always entail significant hematuria and tissue injury.
PMC4397369	A00002	In this study, we characterized a novel allergen, a chymotrypsin-like serine protease.
PMC4397369	D00002	For example, the allergenic potency of German cockroach extract is thought to be influenced by Bla g 3 and α-amylase because their concentration is very high in the extract.19 The number of Bla g 3 clones was highest (48) in EST analysis, followed by Bla g 8 (23) and α-amylase (13) (Table 1).
PMC4397369	D01000	In this study, 6 groups of allergens (Bla g 1, Bla g 3, Bla g 5, Bla g 8, and α-amylase), listed in IUIS, and three novel German cockroach candidate allergens (arginine kinase, trypsin, delta class GST, and chymotrypsin) were identified.

PMC4397369	I01001	Recently, we found that the IgE binding proteins detected by proteomics from German cockroach fecal extract were mainly digestive enzymes such as amylase, midgut carboxy peptidase A, astacin-like metalloprotease, trypsin, and chymotrypsin.3
PMC4397369	I02000	Chymotrypsin-like protease was first described as an allergen from Aspergillus fumigatus.4 Chymotrypsin-like serine proteases were also identified as allergens from house dust mites5,6,7; however, only a small amount of mite chymotrypsin was found in the extract, suggesting a limited role in mite allergenicity.8
PMC4397369	R00003	Bla g 3 (48) was the most frequently identified allergen-like clone, followed by Bla g 8 (23), Bla g 11 (13), glutathione S-transferases (12), trypsin (9), arginine kinase (8), Bla g 1 (3) and chymotrypsin (3).

PMC4506257	D01000	α-enolase does not contain protease activity, is a cellular receptor, and has an important role in plasmin activation and resistance to degradation (11;13).
PMC4506257	D01001	Furthermore, it is involved in monocyte-mediated lung injury through increased surface expression of α-enolase on the surface of monocytes leading to increased plasmin activity, monocyte transmigration into the acutely inflamed lung (14).
PMC4506257	D01002	Bacterial and fungal pathogens employ α-enolase to recruit plasminogen, which becomes activated upon the cell surface allowing for cellular invasion and infection; thus, α-enolase is a virulence factor in this context (21–24).

PMC4603979	D07001	The degradation pathway is initiated by endopeptidases of the aspartic and cysteine classes (cathepsin D supported by cathepsin L and legumain), after which a cathepsin B participates in the production of smaller fragments, and finally the pool of peptide fragments is degraded into dipeptides and amino acids through the action of cathepsin C, cathepsin B, a carboxipeptidase and a leucine aminopeptidase [16, 43].
PMC4603979	D07004	We also identified several proteins with metalloprotease activity, some of which could exert functions similar to that of leucine aminopeptidase, since they belong to the same enzyme class (metallopeptidase class)
PMC4603979	D09000	We also identified several chaperones and antioxidant proteins with oxidoreductase activity, probably involved in stress responses and detoxification reactions associated with blood feeding.

PMC4603979	R10002	The most numerous protein classes were nucleic acid binding (15.7 % in unfed and 20.7 % in fed) and hydrolases (16.3 % in unfed and 14.0 % in fed), followed by oxidoreductases (14.0 % in unfed and 13.3 % in fed), transferases (12.8 % in unfed and 12.7 % in 12.7), enzyme modulators (8.7 % in unfed and 9.3 % in fed), cytoskeletal proteins (9.3 % in unfed and 8.0 % in fed), transporter (6.4 % in unfed and 7.3 % in fed) and membrane traffic proteins (4.1 % in unfed and 8.7 % in fed).
PMC4603979	R14001	These proteases belonged to four different groups (aspartic-type endopeptidase, cysteine-type endopetidase, metallopeptidase and serine-type endopeptidase), except two of them, in which the type of enzyme activity has still not been characterized (B4NAG0, B7PXW8).

PMC4709002	R04003	These data give insight into relative abundance of specific proteins during feeding: proteases (Fig 3A), protease inhibitors (Fig 3B), lipocalins/tick histamine-binding proteins/fatty acid binding proteins (Fig 4A), anti-microbial/immunity-related (Fig 4B), heme-binding proteins (Fig 4C), anti-oxidants (Fig 4D), proteins of unknown function (Fig 5A), glycine rich proteins (Fig 5B) and extracellular matrix proteins (Fig 5C).
PMC4709002	R05000	The I. scapularis genome encodes for at least 233 putatively active and 150 putatively inactive proteases belonging to serine, cysteine, aspartic, metallo, and threonine protease families [68].
PMC4709002	R05001	In this study we found 33 proteases in four clans: serine- (n = 3), cysteine- (n = 3), aspartic- (n = 1), and metalloproteases (n = 26) (S2 Table).
PMC4709002	R05002	When searched against the Merops database [59], the 26 metalloproteases belong to families M12 (n = 15), M20 (n = 4), M2 (n = 2), M28 (n = 2), M13 (n = 1), M17 (n = 1), and M49 (n = 1) (S2 Table), while serine, cysteine and aspartic proteases are classified in families S1, C1 and A1 respectively.
PMC4709002	R05003	Most of the proteases here are likely associated with tick feeding regulation in that 75% (25/33) were detected between 24–120 h during tick feeding except for seven that were identified only in SD (S2 Table).
PMC4709002	R05004	Nearly 40% of proteases in the I. scapularis genome are metalloproteases [68].
PMC4709002	R05005	Whether or not the observation in this study that majority of proteases in I. scapularis tick saliva are metalloproteases reflects the protease composition in I. scapularis genome or it is a physiological event, is unknown at this point.
PMC4709002	R06000	Z-score statistic analysis and visualization of normalized NSAF values of the 26 metalloproteases (Fig 3A) show that M12 and M2 metalloproteases were likely secreted in high abundance between 24–120 h during feeding respectively, which could indicate the importance of these proteins in regulating the first five days to tick feeding.
PMC4709002	R06001	The remaining metalloproteases in families M17, 20, 28 and 49, which were abundant in BD and SD (Fig 3A) are not likely associated with regulating tick feeding events.
PMC4709002	R07000	The observation that I. scapularis predominantly secreted family M12 metalloproteases during feeding is suggestive of the importance of this protein class in tick feeding physiology.
PMC4709002	R07002	A recombinant protein of M12 protease (AAP22067.1, MCC Fig 3A) has gelatinase and fibrin(ogen)olytic activities [69], which is a pro-tick feeding event.
PMC4709002	R07004	In related studies, snake venom M12 proteases were associated with hemorrhaging, edema, hypotension, hypovolemia, inflammation and necrosis [71–73] some of which will promote tick feeding.
PMC4709002	R07005	It will be interesting to characterize the role(s) of tick saliva proteases identified in this study.
PMC4709002	R08000	The first line of host defense to tick feeding such as inflammation, platelet aggregation, blood clotting, complement activation, and cellular immunity are mediated by proteases that are controlled by protease inhibitors (PI).
PMC4709002	R08003	In this study, we identified 43 putative PIs (S1 Table), which according to the Merops database belong in eight families: I2 (Kunitz type serine protease inhibitors, n = 2), I4 (serine protease inhibitors, [serpins], n = 11), I8 (TIL domain serine protease inhibitors, n = 13), I25 (cystatins, cysteine protease inhibitors, n = 4), I31 (thyropins, cysteine protease inhibitors n = 2), I39 (α-2 macroglobulin, A2M, n = 9), I43 (Kazal type serine protease inhibitors, n = 1), and I68 (carboxypeptidase inhibitors, TCI, n = 1) were identified in I. scapularis saliva (S2 Table).
PMC4709002	R08005	The observation here that majority of PIs in this study are likely inhibitors of serine proteases could signal the potential that most host defense pathways to tick feeding are likely serine protease mediated.
PMC4709002	R12005	It is notable that in Radulovic et al., [40], alongside lipocalins/HBPs, a leukotriene B4-like protease was also found among 24–48 h A. americanum immunogenic tick saliva proteins.
PMC4709002	R17006	Glutathione peroxidase (AAK97814.1) previously found among immuno-dominant proteins in engorged I. scapularis [132] is among the 23 anti-oxidants that were found in SD saliva only (S3 Table and Fig 4D).
PMC4709002	R18001	In a recent study, thioredoxin peroxidase gene expression increased in organs of B. burgdorferi infected I. ricinus ticks [133] suggesting involvement in tick and pathogen interaction.
PMC4709002	R18002	It is interesting to note in this study thioredoxin peroxidase protein in non-infected ticks decreased with feeding (S3 Table).
PMC4709002	R24001	In this study we found 9 extracellular proteins (S2 Table) that included cuticle and chitinase-like proteins.
PMC4709002	R24004	It is interesting to note that both the active and inactive forms of chitinase were identified in the first 48 h.
PMC4709002	R24007	The latter is highly identical to A. americanum tick feeding stimuli responsive acidic chitinase [134], which when silenced by RNAi caused ticks to loosely attach onto host skin
PMC4709002	R24009	Blast2seq alignments revealed that the two I. scapularis inactive chitinases (EEC01936.1 and JAB70416.1) identified in both 24 and 48 h saliva are respectively 64 and 65% identical to A. americanum inactive chitinase (AIR95100.1).
PMC4709002	R24010	Whether or not I. scapularis inactive chitinases serves similar function during tick feeding needs further investigation.

PMC4726181	D01007	In IgA nephropathy patients, urinary kininogen excretion was found significantly different for responders and non-responders to an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACE-inhibitor) therapy27, which may be in alignment with the reported variants of kininogen gene influencing individual response to aldosterone28.

PMC4745805	D04001	Our study reveals that several of the subunits of the vacuolar proton-transporting ATPase (V-ATPase), an enzyme responsible for acidifying a variety of intracellular compartments in eukaryotic cells, are enriched in urinary exosomes.
PMC4745805	D04002	This may indicate that the regulation of the proton gradient is especially important for the release of exosomes from prostate cancer cells, although recent studies suggest that vacuolar proton-transporting ATPase can affect intracellular transport by a pH-independent mechanism [41, 42].

PMC4745805	I02009	However, several studies indicate that EVs originate to some extent from prostate cells since several prostate-specific molecules such as prostatic acid phosphatase (prostate-specific molecules such as prostatic acid phosphatase), prostate transglutaminase (TGM4) and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) have been detected in urinary EVs [7, 12, 21-23].
PMC4745805	R08003	Most striking is the presence of lysomal/ late endosomal proteins (11- and 7-fold increase respectively), but also the presence of small GTPase, calcium binding and GST-binding proteins is noteworthy.
PMC4745805	R10000	Several known protein complexes were enriched in prostate cancer patients urinary exosomes, such as the Vacuolar H+ ATPase and the LAMTOR (late endosomal/lysosomal adaptor and mitogen-activated protein kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activator/regulator) complexes (average enrichment 3.7 and 4.5 respectively) (Figure ​(Figure6),6), thus suggesting that these proteins may have a specific role in exosome release from prostate cancer cells.
PMC4745805	R10010	A similar map for the interactions of the 25 down-regulated proteins in urinary exosomes from prostate cancer patients could indicate a central role of the tyrosine kinase Lck, phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C and ESCRT-0 proteins STAM1/2 for signalling events abolished in exosomes from prostatic cancer tissue (Supplemental Fig S5B).
PMC4750543	D00002	Targeted molecular therapies, such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (anaplastic lymphoma kinase) inhibitor, for lung adenocarcinoma have been developed (17–19); however, SCC shows resistance to standard chemotherapy and targeted molecular therapy (4,5).

PMC4762516	R13005	For example, the Rickettsia chaperone proteins, HtpG, DnaK, NADPH reductase, and cytosolic aminopeptidase, were enriched in the Golgi fractions, consistent with either contamination of Golgi fraction with Rickettsia organisms or biological processing of rickettsial proteins by the host Golgi pathway.
PMC4762516	R13006	The cytochrome c oxidase and NADH-quinone oxidoreductases were observed in the Golgi preparations, perhaps suggesting that these molecules may be a source of enhanced superoxide and lipid peroxidation observed in Rickettsia-infected endothelial cells (31).
PMC4762516	R14000	A large number of R. conorii proteins was identified in the soluble fraction of the Golgi preparation and some of these included ferredoxin, heme biosynthetic enzymes, peptide chain releasing factors, protein translocases, and others (Table V).

PMC4825924	A00003	Here, we demonstrate that the yeast palmitoyl transferase ScAkr1p homolog, AkrA in Aspergillus nidulans, regulates [Ca2+]c homeostasis.
PMC4825924	A00005	The [Ca2+]c dynamics in living cells expressing the calcium reporter aequorin in different akrA mutant backgrounds were defective in their [Ca2+]c responses to high extracellular Ca2+ stress or drugs that cause ER or plasma membrane stress.
PMC4825924	A00006	All of these effects on the [Ca2+]c responses mediated by AkrA were closely associated with the cysteine residue of the AkrA DHHC motif, which is required for palmitoylation by AkrA. Using the acyl-biotin exchange chemistry assay combined with proteomic mass spectrometry, we identified protein substrates palmitoylated by AkrA including two new putative P-type ATPases (Pmc1 and Spf1 homologs), a putative proton V-type proton ATPase (Vma5 homolog) and three putative proteins in A. nidulans, the transcripts of which have previously been shown to be induced by extracellular calcium stress in a CrzA-dependent manner.
PMC4825924	A01000	Palmitoylation is a reversible post-translational modification catalyzed by palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs) and proteins that undergo this modification are involved in numerous intracellular functions.

PMC4825924	D01010	PmrA is an A. nidulans homolog of yeast Pmr1, which is a P-type Golgi Ca2+/Mn2+ ATPase responsible for Ca2+ transport into the Golgi and widely accepted as responsible for Ca2+ efflux from the cytoplasm into the Golgi to regulate calcium signaling and homeostasis and prevent calcium toxicity.
PMC4825924	D03000	Altogether, our results provide the first report that AkrA is a putative palmitoyl transferase in A. nidulans, and it mediates calcium influx in a DHHC-dependent mechanism to perform an essential function in calcium homeostasis/signaling for survival under high extracellular calcium-, ER- or azole antifungal-stress conditions.
PMC4825924	D04000	Calcium signaling regulators have been previously identified as antifungal target candidates, including FK506, which targets calcineurin [8].
PMC4825924	D05000	Previous studies have shown that all AkrA homologs across different species require the DHHC motif to be active and function normally as palmitoyl transferases [69–71].
PMC4825924	D05001	Three approaches were initially employed to determine AkrA function: deletion of the DHHC motif; site-directed mutagenesis of the cysteine residue in the DHHC motif; and use of a specific palmitoyl transferase analogue inhibitor (2-bromopalmitate), to determine AkrA function [48,49].
PMC4825924	D05008	Site-directed mutation of the cysteine residue in the DHHC or treatment of the parental wild-type strain with the palmitoyl transferase analogue inhibitor 2-BP completely abolished palmitoylation of AkrA (Fig 8B).
PMC4825924	D05014	When we treated cells with a specific palmitoyl transferase analogue inhibitor 2-BP, AkrA localization within the Golgi localization was completely lost (Fig 8D), suggesting that the 2-BP treatment not only prevented AkrA auto-acyltation but also prevented the normal subcellular localization of AkrA.
PMC4825924	D06000	In conclusion, our results provide the first report that AkrA is a palmitoyl transferase in A. nidulans, and that it mediates calcium influx in a DHHC-dependent mechanism to perform an essential role in calcium homeostasis to survive high extracellular calcium-, ER- and plasma membrane-stress conditions.

PMC4825924	I00008	In addition, fungi possess a range of other calcium P-type ATPases and calcium transporters that play important roles in calcium signaling and homeostasis [6].
PMC4825924	I01000	The phosphatase calcineurin is an important [Ca2+]c transient effector and is conserved from yeast to humans.
PMC4825924	I01001	Its most well known target in fungi is the transcription factor Crz1 (calcineurin responsive zinc finger 1)
PMC4825924	I01006	These stimuli result in calcium uptake and a transient increase in [Ca2+]c which leads to calcineurin activation and subsequent Crz1 de-phosphorylation.
PMC4825924	I01008	Interestingly, there are no known mammalian Crz1 orthologs, but mammals express another calcineurin sensitive transcription factor target, known as NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T-cells).
PMC4825924	I01009	Crz1 does not belong to the NFAT family, but the Zn-finger domains in Crz1 and NFAT bind specific DNA sequences within the promoter regions of calcineurin-dependent response elements (CDREs) to activate transcription [15,16].
PMC4825924	I01010	In the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans, there is a calcineurin-dependent Crz1 homolog, known as CrzA. Interestingly, calcineurin deletion causes more severe growth defects than CrzA deletion in this species, suggesting that calcineurin has additional target proteins other than CrzA
PMC4825924	I02001	Palmitoyl transferases (PATs) are known to be responsible for palmitoylation.
PMC4825924	I02002	The defining feature of PATs is the presence of a cysteine-rich domain (CRD) with an Asp-His-His-Cys (DHHC) motif, which is required for palmitoyl transferase activity.
PMC4825924	I03000	In this study, we have demonstrated that AnAkrA in A. nidulans and AfAkrA in A. fumigatus, which are homologs of the yeast palmitoyl transferase ScAkr1p, have similar function to the HACS in the presence of low extracellular calcium.
PMC4825924	I03002	Moreover, using codon-optimized aequorin as a calcium reporter in living cells, we found that AkrA dysfunction significantly decreased the amplitude of the [Ca2+]c transient induced by an extracellular calcium stimulus, ER stress caused by tunicamycin or plasma membrane stress resulting from itraconazole, respectively.
PMC4825924	I03004	Moreover, we have identified that two new putative P-type ATPases (Pmc1 and Spf1 homologs), a putative proton V-type proton ATPase (Vma5 homolog) and three putative CrzA-dependent proteins, are palmitoylated substrates of the AkrA protein.
PMC4825924	R00000	Based on a NCBI BLASTp search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), we identified a putative ortholog of NFAT in A. nidulans, AkrA (AN5824.4, Accession: XP_663428.1), which encodes a putative palmitoyltransferase.
PMC4825924	R00002	Interestingly, a bioinformatic analysis revealed that the promoter region contains a putative calcineurin-dependent-response-element (CDRE-like) motif.
PMC4825924	R04004	Since Cys487 in the DHHC motif has previously been shown to be crucial for palmitoyl transferase activity, we therefore mutated Cys487 to Ser487 in the DHHC motif (Fig 3A)
PMC4825924	R07000	Previous studies have demonstrated that pmr1, which encodes a Ca2+/Mn2+ P-type ATPase and is involved in Ca2+ homeostasis, localizes to the Golgi in yeast [37].
PMC4825924	R08002	We monitored the extracellular calcium-induced [Ca2+]c changes in living cells of A. nidulans wild type and mutant strains in which we expressed codon-optimized aequorin [42–44].
PMC4825924	R09001	[45–47], suggesting that other Ca2+-ATPases may compensate for the loss of PmrA function in response to the extracellular calcium stimulus.
PMC4825924	R10001	To determine whether inhibition of palmitoyl transferase activity influences calcium influx into the cytoplasm, we measured the [Ca2+]c amplitude of the wild type pre-incubated in 2-BP (20 μM) for 2 h. Following this drug treatment, the amplitude of the [Ca2+]c increase following stimulation with 0.1 M CaCl2 was significantly reduced by approximately 40% of the untreated cells in response to stimulation with 0.1 M CaCl2 (Fig 5).
PMC4825924	R10002	These data suggest that the inhibition of palmitoyl transferase activity can significantly block calcium influx.
PMC4825924	R11000	Activation of Ca2+ channels, calmodulin, calcineurin and other factors is necessary for the long-term survival of cells undergoing ER stress, and during this process the HACS components, CchA and MidA, are required for Ca2+ influx from the extracellular environment [41,50,51].
PMC4825924	R13006	Several previous reports have suggested that the process of palmitoylation involves in a two-step mechanism in which palmitoyl transferase is auto-acylated by itself to create an intermediate followed by the transfer of the palmitoyl moiety to its substrate [53,54].
PMC4825924	R15006	In our study we notably identified the following protein substrates palmitoylated by AkrA: a vacuolar Ca2+-ATPase Pmc1 homolog (AN5088.4); a P-type ATPase Spf1 homolog (AN3146.4) involved in calcium homeostasis [58]; a putative V-type H+-ATPase Vma5 homolog (AN1195.4) that has been linked to Ca2+-ATPase function [59], and three uncharacterized proteins (AN8774.4, AN3420.4 and AN2427.4), the transcripts of which have previously been shown to be induced by extracellular calcium stress in a CrzA-dependent manner [53].

PMC4881457	R08001	For example, the accumulation of osteopontin (Figure 6a), uteroglobin, calreticulin, CD59 glycoprotein, vascular adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1) (Figure 6b), prostaglandin-H2 D-isomerase, superoxide dismutase (Figure 6c), and guanylin was detected only in the most advanced CKD stages.
PMC4882050	A00001	Our research team previously reported the production in vitro of Cyst-Like Structures (CLS) sharing structural features with cysts, including rounded shape, size reduction, multinucleation, and the formation of a chitin wall coupled to the overexpression of glucosamine 6-phosphate isomerase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the chitin synthesis pathway.
PMC4882050	D01006	Furthermore, the expression of mRNA encoding for the cyst wall proteins Jessie 1, Jessie 3, and Jacob, but not Jessie 2 nor chitin synthase, were identified by RT-PCR in CLS, suggesting that at least the mRNA encoding for two Jessie and the Jacob proteins were present.
PMC4882050	D03003	Furthermore, metabolic enzymes such as fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, NADP-dependent alcohol-dehydrogenase-1, and phosphoglycerate kinase were also identified with high peptide-hit scores.
PMC4882050	D03005	In addition, we also detected proteins that have previously been associated with the virulence and pathogenicity of E. histolytica such as peroxiredoxin and alcohol dehydrogenase 3 [22,23].

PMC4882050	I01006	Other studies have included phagosome composition and proteins associated to the phagocytosis process [12–16], the cell surface proteome that identified 12 protein families [17], the pre-mRNA splicing complexes that identified 36 proteins as involved, and other 50 proteins as possibly involved in co-transcriptional processes [18], 33 proteins modulated in cells overexpressing the EhPC4 transcription factor [19] and a pull-down assay that identified two endoribonucleases interacting with the EhCAF1 deadenylase [20].
PMC4882050	I01008	About 1,500 proteins were grouped into two main classes, traffic machinery and GTPases, and about 100 markers were identified in both compartments [21].
PMC4882050	I01009	Additionally, a comparison of the E. histolytica proteome with that of the related non-pathogen amoeba E. dispar has allowed the identification of peroxiredoxin and alcohol dehydrogenase 3 as proteins associated to virulence and pathogenicity [22,23].
PMC4882050	I02010	These CLS showed features closely resembling genuine cysts, including rounded shape, size reduction, refringence, multinucleation (mainly 2 or 3 nuclei, and occasionally 4), and overexpression of glucosamine 6-phosphate isomerase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the chitin synthesis pathway [32].
PMC4882050	I02011	In a subsequent study, CLS formation by hydrogen peroxide was inhibited in trophozoites in which glucosamine 6-phosphate isomerase expression was silenced by siRNA [33].
PMC4882050	R03003	It is remarkable that peptide-hits for cellular metabolism proteins like pyruvate phosphate dikinase, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, phosphoglycerate kinase, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, and galactokinase were more than double in trophozoites than in CLS and cysts (Table 2).
PMC4882050	R03004	In contrast, peptide-hit score was higher, in some cases two or three times higher, for oxidative stress enzymes like peroxiredoxin and two HSP70 (Bip and a putative one), as well as for disulfide isomerase and EF-hand calcium-binding domain-containing proteins in CLS samples than in trophozoites and cysts.
PMC4882050	R04006	In contrast, cysts showed high expression levels of many putative uncharacterized proteins (8 out 15 proteins with the highest peptide-hit score) in addition to a putative nuclear transcription factor, an aminoglycoside 3’-phosphotransferase, and an alkyl sulfatase.
PMC4882050	R08001	Three proteins that were identified as less abundant in CLS with respect to trophozoites (malic enzyme, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
PMC4882050	R08003	In agreement with the proteomic results, the RT-PCR showed that malic enzyme and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase were not expressed in CLS, in contrast with trophozoites where the expression was clearly detected (Fig 5).
PMC4882050	R09001	In addition, CLS overexpress glucosamine 6-phosphate isomerase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the chitin synthesis pathway, suggesting an activation of the chitin formation route in CLS.
PMC4882050	R09003	Thus, the expression of genes encoding for some of these proteins was evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR using E. histolytica specific primers for Jessie 1, 2, and 3; the Jacob protein; and chitin synthase.
PMC4882050	R10001	Although CLS have a detergent-resistant wall suggesting the presence of chitin, no chitin synthase expression was detected in that stage (Fig 6).
PMC4893419	A02001	From the list, we identified a number of functionally significant proteins including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, S100 proteins, AXL receptor protein tyrosine kinase, macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), programmed cell death ligand 2 (PDCD1LG2), TNF receptor 2, (TNFRSF1B) and many novel proteins including hyaluronan-binding protein 2, semaphorin 4A (SEMA4D) and osteoclast stimulating factor 1.

PMC4893419	R03001	It belongs to the peptidyl arginine deiminase family of enzymes that carries out citrullination reactions, the post-translational deimination reaction of proteins accompanied by the conversion of arginine residues into citrullines [48].
PMC4893419	R03004	We also observed angiotensin converting enzyme (angiotensin converting enzyme) which has been previously reported to be overexpressed in synovial stroma in patients with RA as compared to those with osteoarthritis [51].
PMC4893419	R03005	An increase in the levels of angiotensin converting enzyme essentially reflects the production of angiogensin II, which is a local vasoconstrictor [51].

PMC4893419	R03009	Cysteine proteases, referred to as the cathepsins, were also found and they include cathepsin B, D, H, S and Z types and are actively involved in bone resorption [53].
PMC4893419	R04012	Role of vascularisation in the synovium of RA patients by AXL receptor tyrosine kinase has also been studied earlier; thus its presence in our list is in agreement with previous studies [61] (MS/MS spectrum of one its peptides is shown in Fig. 2b).

PMC4910742	A00002	We combined immunological and proteomic approaches and identified CD245 as the unconventional myosin 18A, a highly conserved motor enzyme reported as a receptor for the surfactant protein A (SP-A), that plays a critical role in cytoskeleton organization and Golgi budding.

PMC4910742	R06001	These phosphatases interact with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on other proteins through their SH2 domains.28-31 We thus investigated whether myosin 18A was able to recruit SHP-1, SHP-2 or SHIP.
PMC4941320	A00004	Six antigens were subsequently identified as HSP 70, HSP 90, alpha-enolase (Eno-1), Annexin A2, glutathione synthetase and beta-actin by mass spectrometry.

PMC4954996	D00004	Further proteomic characterization of this subfraction revealed a number of immunogenic proteins 30, including adenosyl‐L‐homocysteine hydrolase.
PMC4954996	D00005	This was identified as a drug target in other organisms 31, but in this study adenosyl‐L‐homocysteine hydrolase was developed as recombinant protein and was eventually reassessed for immunogenicity using lymphocytes/PBMCs of treated Leishmania‐infected hamsters and patients.
PMC4954996	D01021	Moreover, in addition to LTT response, a ∼two‐ to threefold increase in NO level was observed in the lymphocytes of vaccinated hamsters, which also confirms the up‐regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase by Th1 cell‐associated cytokines which, in turn, activates the macrophages to kill the intracellular parasites 45.
PMC4954996	D02002	This supports the view involving the up‐regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase with the aid of Th1 cell‐associated cytokines, and confirms that the NO‐mediated macrophage effector mechanism is important to control parasite growth in the animal model 40.

PMC4954996	I00010	Because adenosyl‐L‐homocysteine hydrolase is a product inhibitor of all S‐adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)‐dependent methyltransferases, in eukaryotic cells the catalytic activity of adenosyl‐L‐homocysteine hydrolase is necessary to maintain the ordinary cellular level of AdoHcy and to promote the various transmethylation reactions needed in typical cell functions to continue 9, 10.
PMC4954996	I00011	In eukaryotic cells, inhibition of adenosyl‐L‐homocysteine hydrolase hydrolase causes the hindrance of AdoMet‐dependent methyltransferases and also promotes the increment of cellular levels of adenosyl‐L‐homocysteine hydrolase that result in different pharmacological effects (e.g. anti‐arthritic, anti‐viral, immunosuppressive, anti‐tumour, etc.)

PMC4964914	D04004	The components of the commercial PI cocktail are proprietary but of the four major classes of proteolytic enzymes (serine, cysteine, metallo‐, and aspartic), it is aimed at inhibition of cysteine and serine proteases.
PMC4964914	D04005	Given that the pH of all samples was adjusted to neutral to avoid precipitation 35, it is unlikely that aspartic proteases that are active at acidic pH are responsible for any of the changes in peptides we have seen in the presence or absence of PI.
PMC4964914	D04006	However, the PI cocktail is EDTA‐free to avoid issues with the IMAC chemistry and therefore matrix‐metalloproteinases may account for some of the peptide changes.
PMC4964914	D04007	Certainly, examples of various matrix metalloproteinases and their complexes have been reported in urine in a variety of diseases including urinary tract infection, post‐renal transplantation with either acute/chronic rejection or fibrosis, and diabetes 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.
PMC4964914	D04008	The differences in peaks affected in the presence and absence of PI, although there is some overlap, are likely to reflect the differing patterns of activity/inhibition of the various contributing proteases and therefore different peptide masses.
PMC4964914	D04009	Unfortunately, the identities of the peptides could not be determined, which is a major limitation of the SELDI platform and which has precluded our modeling of possible proteases involved 29.

PMC4998552	A01000	We aimed to identify serum sialoglycoproteins that are targeted by neuraminidases in severe pneumococcal infection.
PMC4998552	A02000	We constructed serum sialoglycoprotein profiles before and after pneumococcal neuraminidase treatment using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), a proteomic approach.
PMC4998552	A03000	The most abundant serum sialoglycoproteins identified by LC-MS/MS after neuraminidase treatment and peanut lectin capture were immunoglobulins, apolipoproteins, fibrinogens, keratins, complement system proteins, and fetuin-A. Serum fetuin-A levels in the HUS patients were significantly lower (207 ± 80 mg/L, P < 0.001) than in patients with lobar pneumonia (610 ± 190 mg/L) as well as the healthy controls (630 ± 250 mg/L).
PMC4998552	D00000	Neuraminidase-producing organisms like S. pneumoniae acquire sialic acid by cleaving host sialoglycoconjugates and use it as carbon and nitrogen source.10 During pneumococcal infection, cleavage of sialyl linkages to expose TA in host cells is due to a higher neuraminidase activity from NanA, NanB, or NanC or an additive effect of the three.3 Previously, S. pneumoniae serotype 2 (strain R6) and serotype 4 (strain TIGR4) were used to confirm α2-3 sialyl linkages specificity of the NanB and NanC.19,20
PMC4998552	D00001	This study used a serotype 14 strain to confirm substrate specificity of pneumococcal neuraminidases both in vitro and ex vivo; NanA showed activity toward both α2-3 and α2-6 sialyl linkages, while both NanB and NanC cleaved only α2-3 sialyl linkages.
PMC4998552	D01000	The most abundant serum sialoglycoproteins identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry after neuraminidase treatment and peanut lectin capture were immunoglobulins, apolipoproteins, fibrinogens, keratins, complement system proteins, and fetuin-A. Sialoglycoproteins AGP, fibrinogen, and CRP are currently being used as biomarkers in the clinically setting.
PMC4998552	D02004	In this study, LC/MS data revealed that coagulation factors including high molecular weight kininogen, fibrinogen, and factor XII were targeted by pneumococcal neuraminidases, but in vitro experiment verified that only NanA could prolong aPTT.
PMC4998552	D03002	Recently, Kebapcilar et al described that baseline serum fetuin-A was 43% lower in Helicobacter pylori-infected patients than in H. pylori-negative subjects.29 Li et al also reported that circulating fetuin-A levels were decreased in animal models of lethal endotoxemia and sepsis.29,30 In HUS patients, pneumococcal neuraminidase cleaves N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) residues on RBC leading to the exposure of the Thomsen–Friedenrich antigen (T-antigen [TA]) on cells and allowing normally circulating anti-TA antibodies to react with the exposed TA to form immune complex and subsequently causes lysis of the cells.2 We observed that fetuin protects RBC from desialylation and subsequent TA exposure; this might be due to a competitive inhibitory effect of bovine fetuin on the activity of NanA, NanB, and NanC on RBC.
PMC4998552	D03003	The bovine fetuin concentrations used to inhibit neuraminidases in vitro were 2 to 4 times greater than the concentration of fetuin-A in human serum; therefore, it is possible that other sialo-glycoproteins in addition to fetuin-A could have some protective effect during pneumococcal infection, but this requires further studies to verify.
PMC4998552	D03004	As a major sialoglycoprotein in human serum, neuraminidase activity in blood in patients with IPD could be titrated by fetuin-A and the low concentration of fetuin-A or other sialoglycoproteins may indirectly reflect the severity of the infection.
PMC4998552	D04001	In addition, all the 3 pneumococcal neuraminidases released following autolysis of pneumococci could reach the circulatory system and the overall activity of the 3 neuraminidases would predispose children with severe pulmonary infection to HUS.3 Invasive pneumococcal infection is a common cause of HUS in Taiwan and the United States, and pneumococcal HUS is invariably associated with prolonged hospital stays.32,33 Detection of TA activation using PNA was thought to be the most appropriate test to support the diagnosis of pneumococcal HUS.34

PMC4998552	I00003	We thus speculated that NanC might contribute to the risk of developing HUS in an additive manner in the presence of NanA and NanB by increasing the overall activity of pneumococcal neuraminidases, and so was associated with the occurrence of HUS following pneumococcal infection.3

PMC4998552	M00001	NanC proteins of S. pneumoniae strain CGSP14 were expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by Ni2+ affinity chromatography using Nickel-Chelating Resin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).9,10 To identify serum sialoglycoproteins that are targeted by pneumococcal neuraminidases, human serum was treated with NanA, NanB, and NanC and asialoglycoproteins were captured by peanut lectin (PNA) conjugated agarose column (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and the eluted sample was analyzed by Western blot hybridization.11,12 And protein samples were submitted to liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis.13

PMC5047454	A00003	Substantial differences were found in the levels of particular outer membrane proteins between resistant and sensitive strains, i.e. outer membrane protease E (PgtE) was present mainly in resistant strains, while sensitive strains possessed a high level of flagellar hook-associated protein 2 (FliD) and significantly higher levels of outer membrane protein A (OmpA).
PMC5047454	D02004	The experiments showed, that the main difference in the OMP composition was a relatively high level of outer membrane protease E (PgtE, spot A, Fig 3I) and a low level of flagellar hook associated protein 2 (FliD, spots B and C, Fig 3II) in resistant strains: S.

PMC5050164	A00000	Kinases are one of the most important families of enzymes that are involved in numerous cell signaling processes.
PMC5050164	A00001	Existing methods for studying kinase expression and activation have limited kinome coverage.
PMC5050164	A00004	Our results led to the quantification of 328 unique kinases.
PMC5050164	A00005	In particular, we found that methylglyoxal treatment gave rise to altered expression of a number of kinases in the MAPK pathway and diminished expression of several receptor tyrosine kinases, including epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin growth factor 2 receptor (IGF2R), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), etc.
PMC5050164	D00000	Reversible phosphorylation of proteins and other biomolecules by kinases and phosphatases constitute one of the most important and best studied pathways in cell signaling.
PMC5050164	D00004	In particular, our expanded kinome library covers approximately 80% of human kinome and contains 474 human kinases (488 unique IPIs), among which 409, 14 and 51 were protein kinases, lipid kinases, and other kinases, respectively.
PMC5050164	D01000	This method was successfully employed to assess the alterations of the kinome in HEK293T cells after MG treatment, which allowed for the quantification of 328 kinases.
PMC5050164	D01001	Among these quantified kinases, 49 were perturbed, 8 of which were RTKs.
PMC5050164	D01002	Further experiments on selected receptor tyrosine kinases showed that MG led to a dose-dependent decrease in the level of EGFR protein via a mechanism that differs from the diminished expression of IGF2R and FGFR1 proteins.
PMC5050164	D01004	In addition, while the MG-triggered decrease in all three receptor tyrosine kinases could be restored by preincubation of cells with an antioxidant (i.e. NAC), scavengers of α-ketoaldehydes (i.e. AG and MET) could only rescue the MG-induced reduction of IGF2R and FGFR1 proteins, but not that of EGFR.
PMC5050164	D01007	In addition, the capability of NAC in restoring the MG-induced decreases in all three receptor tyrosine kinases is in keeping with the previous proposal that hyperglycemia-induced ROS activates many pathways of tissue damage in diabetic patients.40,41 Our results suggest that the inhibition of RTKs may contribute to the development of diabetic complications, and restoration of the functions of RTKs may provide new venues for the therapeutic interventions of diabetic complications.
PMC5050164	I00000	Kinases are responsible for catalyzing the phosphorylation of numerous biological molecules,1 and they play crucial roles in cell signaling and regulating cell proliferation and metabolism.2 Aberrant expression and/or activation of kinases have been found in cancer and other human diseases.3
PMC5050164	I00001	However, the extremely low levels of expression of many kinases hamper global kinome studies.
PMC5050164	I00002	Recently published results showed that ATP-affinity probes could be employed for the covalent labeling, enrichment, and subsequent mass spectrometric identification and quantification of kinases with excellent specificity and sensitivity (Figure 1, Figure S1).4,5
PMC5050164	I01002	We recently developed an MRM-based method for high-throughput assessment of kinase expression and activation.8
PMC5050164	I01003	The previous version of the kinome library encompassed 320 unique peptides from 242 kinases, among which approximately 200 were protein kinases.
PMC5050164	I01004	Importantly, this library contains information about the integrated retention times (iRT)9 and unique MRM transitions for kinase peptides.
PMC5050164	I01005	Along with the use of desthiobiotin-containing isotope-coded ATP-affinity probe (ICAP) or stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), the method enables quantitative profiling of the global kinome.10,11 The previous version of the library, however, only encompasses approximately 40% of the human kinome, which leaves a large portion of kinases inaccessible.12
PMC5050164	I01006	In addition, a similar number of kinases were identified with the use of kinome beads for kinase enrichment.13–16 Thus, monitoring the majority of the human kinome necessitates the expansion of the MRM kinome library.
PMC5050164	I02001	In addition, MG can react with DNA and induce the formation of N2-(1-carboxyethyl)-2′-deoxyguanosine (N2-CEdG) as the major stable DNA adduct.19,20 However, no study has been conducted about how MG perturbs cell signaling by altering the expression or activation of kinases at the global kinome level.
PMC5050164	I03000	In this study, we expanded substantially the MRM-based kinome library by interrogating the global kinomes of 9 additional human cell lines and by using synthetic desthiobiotinylated kinase peptides.
PMC5050164	I03002	More than 300 unique kinases were quantified; a number of kinases in the MAPK pathway and several receptor tyrosine kinases were found to be substantially altered in response to methylglyoxal treatment.
PMC5050164	I03003	Together, we expanded successfully our MRM kinome library to achieve an unprecedented coverage of the human kinome and our study also provided important insights into the roles of kinase signaling in the development of diabetic complications.
PMC5050164	M01001	Synthetic kinase peptides harboring a desthiobiotin-modified lysine were obtained from New England Peptide, Inc. and analyzed by 1D-LC-MS/MS, as described in detail in the Supplementary Materials.
PMC5050164	M02000	All LC-MS/MS data obtained from discovery-mode proteomic analysis were searched against the human IPI protein database version 3.68 (87,062 entries) by using MaxQuant (Version 1.3.0.5).22 Skyline (version 3.5)23 was used to construct spectral libraries for kinase peptides.
PMC5050164	M06002	cDNA was synthesized by using M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega) and an oligo(dT)16 primer.
PMC5050164	R01000	We first purified, by using avidin agarose beads, the desthiobiotin-C3-labeled kinase peptides from the tryptic digestion mixtures of lysates of 9 human cell lines (i.e. GM-00637, GM-04429, GM15876A, HCT-116, U2OS, CEM, DU-145, HEK293T and MCF-7) that were labeled with the light desthiobiotin-C3-ATP probe (Figure 1a).
PMC5050164	R01002	The tandem mass spectra and the retention time information of all desthiobiotin-C3-labeled kinase peptides were imported into Skyline to expand the initial kinome library that was constructed from LC-MS/MS data acquired from 6 human cell lines (i.e. K562, IMR-90, HeLa-S3, Jurkat-T, WM-115, and WM-266-4).8
PMC5050164	R01003	A maximum of five peptides were selected for each kinase, and the three or four most abundant y-ions observed in MS/MS acquired in the DDA mode were employed for MRM monitoring of each peptide.
PMC5050164	R02000	Owing to its relatively high reactivity, the desthiobiotin-C3-ATP probe may react with, apart from the lysine residue(s) located at the ATP-binding site of ATP-binding proteins, lysine residues in other proteins through electrostatic interactions.4,5 Thus, we classified the kinase peptides from the 15 cell lines in our library into two groups on the basis of local amino acid sequences surrounding the probe-labeled lysine, as described previously.8
PMC5050164	R02002	Although the latter group of peptides do not reside in any of the known conserved ATP-binding motifs and their involvement in ATP binding remains to be determined, their high frequencies of identification in shotgun proteomic studies render these peptides suitable candidates for quantifying the corresponding kinases.
PMC5050164	R03000	With the use of the ICAP reagents (Figure 1a), a large portion of protein kinases were labeled on the lysine residues located in the ATP-binding motifs that are highly conserved.
PMC5050164	R03001	As a result, some of the identified desthiobiotin-C3-labeled peptides may be assigned to multiple protein kinases.
PMC5050164	R03002	To avoid ambiguity in kinase quantification with the MRM method, we inspected each identified desthiobiotin-C3-labeled peptide in the MRM kinome library and deleted those that could be attributed to multiple kinases.
PMC5050164	R04000	After combining all unique kinase peptides from the 15 cell lines, the MRM library contains 640 distinct peptides derived from 370 kinases (by using DAVID Bioinformatics Resources),24,25 which cover about 60% of the human kinome.
PMC5050164	R04001	To further expand the library, we checked the sequences of the protein kinases12 that were not identified from the aforementioned shotgun proteomic analyses.
PMC5050164	R04004	By doing so, we substantially expanded our MRM library to contain 818 unique peptides from 474 distinct human kinases.
PMC5050164	R04005	These include 409 protein kinases, 14 lipid kinases, and 51 other kinases (e.g. nucleoside kinases and carbohydrate kinases, Table S2).
PMC5050164	R04006	Thus, our expanded MRM kinome library has a coverage of approximately 80% of the human kinome which contains a total of 518 protein kinases.12
PMC5050164	R05000	Considering that at least three transitions are needed for each of light- and heavy-probe-labeled peptide, quantitative measurements of 818 kinase peptides by MRM necessitates more than 5000 MRM transitions.
PMC5050164	R05002	Therefore, accurate retention time (RT) prediction for the kinase peptides is essential for our multiplexed MRM-based kinome assay.
PMC5050164	R05003	To this end, we calculated the iRT value for each peptide on our target list following a previously published method.9 Based on retention time information of targeted peptides analyzed on an LTQ Orbitrap Velos coupled with EASY-nLC II system, we used 10 BSA peptides as standards and successfully converted empirically determined retention times of 98% (803 out of 818) kinase peptides into normalized iRT scores, which reflect their conserved elution order.
PMC5050164	R06000	It is worth noting that the custom-synthesized peptides carry a desthiobiotin-labeled lysine, whereas the kinase peptides arising from ATP affinity probe labeling contain a desthiobiotin-C3-labeled lysine.
PMC5050164	R06003	With the iRT values of the desthiobiotin-labeled kinase peptides and the existing iRT values of the corresponding desthiobiotin-C3-labeled kinase peptides in the library, a linear relationship in iRT values between the desthiobiotin-labeled peptides and the desthiobiotin-C3-labeled counterparts could be established (Figure S2a, Table S3).
PMC5050164	R07001	It turned out that the MRM-based kinome analysis led to the detection of 470 unique peptides from 313 distinct human kinases in 5 LC-MS/MS runs.
PMC5050164	R07002	On the other hand, the shotgun proteomic approach using online 2D-LC-MS/MS with a 9-step gradient during SCX fractionation only gave rise to the identification of 174 kinases.
PMC5050164	R09000	The results from the MRM-based targeted proteomic method led to the quantification of a total of 328 unique kinases, including 288 protein kinases, 11 lipid kinases and 29 other kinases, which cover approximately 55% of the human kinome (Figure 2 and Table S4).
PMC5050164	R09001	In the viewpoint that approximately 400 protein kinases are expressed in a single cell,14 more than 70% of the expressed protein kinases could be quantified with the MRM-based kinome assay.
PMC5050164	R09002	All the quantified kinase peptides exhibit an excellent linear fit between the observed retention time and the iRT in the library (Figure 3a).
PMC5050164	R09003	Similar relative abundances of 3 transitions obtained from MRM and shotgun proteomic analyses illustrate the robust quantification of the kinase peptides by MRM analysis (Figure 3c, d).
PMC5050164	R09004	More than 90% of the quantified kinase peptides displayed a consistent trend in forward and reverse labeling experiments in MRM-based targeted analysis (Table S4, and representative results for EGFR are shown in Figure 3b), demonstrating the excellent performance of this method.
PMC5050164	R10000	Among the 328 quantified kinases, 40 and 9 were down- and up-regulated (with at least 1.5-fold change), respectively, in HEK293T cells following a 24-hr treatment with 200 μM MG.
PMC5050164	R10001	In addition, 11 out of 49 perturbed kinases are involved in MAPK pathway, rendering it the major pathway perturbed by MG treatment (Figure S3, Figure 4a).
PMC5050164	R10002	In this vein, the MG-induced alteration of MAPK signaling pathway was reported previously.29,30 Furthermore, 8 receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including EPHA2, EPHA4, EGFR, IGF2R, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and NTRK2, were found to be altered upon MG treatment and all of them except FGFR2 were down-regulated (Figure 4b).
PMC5050164	R11001	Thus, we focused on these kinases to explore the mechanisms through which their alterations are induced by MG treatment.
PMC5050164	R12000	We next validated the MRM findings by using Western blot analysis and assessed whether the MG-induced decrease of the three receptor tyrosine kinases could be rescued by pre-incubation of cells with scavengers of α-ketoaldehydes and an antioxidant.
PMC5087317	A00000	Kinase inhibitor resistance often involves upregulation of poorly understood “bypass” signaling pathways.
PMC5087317	A00002	Proteolytic shedding of surface receptors, which can provide negative feedback on signaling activity, is blocked by kinase inhibitor treatment and enhances bypass signaling.
PMC5087317	A00003	In particular, MEK inhibition broadly decreases shedding of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including HER4, MET, and most prominently AXL, an ADAM10 and ADAM17 substrate, thus increasing surface RTK levels and mitogenic signaling.
PMC5087317	A00005	Disrupting protease inhibition by neutralizing TIMP1 improves mitogen-activated-protein-kinase inhibitor efficacy, and combined MAPK/AXL inhibition synergistically reduces tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft models.
PMC5087317	D00001	Inhibition of multiple signaling pathways, particularly ERK signaling through MEK1/2, reduces proteolytic RTK shedding and leads to enhanced mitogenic signaling through bypass kinase pathways including JUN N-terminal kinase.
PMC5087317	D00002	Numerous examples of increased RTK signaling activity have been observed following targeted kinase inhibitor treatment, often with little mechanistic explanation outside of transcriptional upregulation (1, 4, 5, 41).
PMC5087317	D00003	MEK and PI3K kinase inhibition have been shown to enhance the signaling of sheddase substrates including HER2 (3, 5) and AXL (1, 42), and we show here that inhibition of MEK, BRAF, and to some extent PI3K, p38, and JUN N-terminal kinase (as in Fig.
PMC5087317	D01000	The promiscuous nature of metalloproteinases has made it difficult to anticipate the overall effects of perturbing their activities, especially in response to kinase inhibition (17, 19).
PMC5087317	D01003	Nonetheless, substantial evidence suggests that MEKi inhibits a disintegrin and metalloproteinase catalytic activities themselves (Fig. 7), and we highlight an unappreciated role for TIMP1 association in this context.
PMC5087317	D01006	This work suggests that past metalloproteinase inhibitor clinical trials may have failed partly due to unanticipated compensatory signaling feedback from unshed RTKs.
PMC5087317	D02005	Here we show that kinase inhibition simultaneously increases full-length RTK on the cell surface while decreasing decoy receptor levels in the extracellular supernatant or in circulation.
PMC5087317	D03001	Many RTKs reported as transcriptionally upregulated in response to kinase inhibition are themselves sheddase substrates, including PDGFRβ (1, 8), VEGFR2 (1), and CD44 (47).

PMC5087317	I00002	For example, targeting mitogen-activated-protein-kinase (mitogen-activated-protein-kinase) signaling through MEK or B-RAF inhibition leads to increased transcription of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which then provide alternative pro-growth and pro-survival signals that circumvent the intended inhibitor effects (1–3).
PMC5087317	I01001	MEK inhibition (MEKi) represents one promising therapeutic strategy, as mitogen-activated-protein-kinase signaling is dysregulated in many cancers, including TNBC and melanoma (9, 10), and clinical trials have recently been completed or are ongoing in several cancers including TNBC (9).
PMC5087317	I01002	As a treatment strategy, mitogen-activated-protein-kinase inhibition (MAPKi) has been most successful in melanoma, with three such inhibitors gaining FDA approval since 2011.
PMC5087317	I01004	More generally, MAPKi carries broad importance given many other relevant drug targets including various RTKs are upstream of the mitogen-activated-protein-kinase pathway and indirectly affect its activity.
PMC5087317	I02000	Relative to tumor gene expression changes, little attention has been paid to how the tumor-derived extracellular proteome changes in response to targeted kinase inhibitors, and how such changes impact bypass signaling and drug efficacy.
PMC5087317	I02001	Of central importance, the ‘A Disintegrin and Metalloproteinases’ (ADAMs) ADAM10 and ADAM17 are widely known as the principal “sheddases” of the cell surface responsible for shedding ectodomains of hundreds of transmembrane substrates, including many growth factors, cytokines, adhesion molecules, and metalloproteinases involved in the processes described above.
PMC5087317	I02004	and ADAM17 are particularly overexpressed in many cancers including breast cancer and melanoma (13, 14), with activities governed by frequently dysregulated mitogen-activated-protein-kinase signaling (10, 15).
PMC5087317	I02007	These failures can largely be attributed to a poor understanding of how the broad activity of ADAMs, and metalloproteinases in general, integrate to influence overall tumor behavior (19).
PMC5087317	I03001	Proteolytic shedding of surface receptors, which can provide negative feedback on signaling network activity, is dramatically reduced upon inhibition of kinase pathways such as the mitogen-activated-protein-kinase pathway.
PMC5087317	I03005	We tested two strategies to enhance MAPKi efficacy: (1) modulating ADAM10 through neutralizing its cognate inhibitor “tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases 1” (TIMP1), and (2) inhibiting the RTK AXL, a key protease substrate that we observed to be upregulated following MAPKi.
PMC5087317	R00001	However, little is known regarding how extracellular RTK levels change in response to targeted kinase inhibitor treatment, and how such changes influence drug efficacy in cancer.
PMC5087317	R00010	Supernatant accumulation of both RTKs could be blocked by broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibition (MPi) using batimastat (BB94), suggesting their accumulation resulted from proteolytic release off the cell surface (Fig.
PMC5087317	R00012	EGFR, which is not a suspected metalloproteinase substrate, behaved in stark contrast to MET and AXL: in the supernatant, EGFR i) did not consistently decrease in response to MEKi (Fig.
PMC5087317	R10009	Notably, cell lines displaying synergistic response were also enriched for RAS mutation, which is possibly related to a decreased reliance on signaling through proteolytically shed EGF-ligands for mitogen-activated-protein-kinase activity, and which is clinically relevant due to the frequent assessment of RAS mutation in patient tumors (Fig.
PMC5087317	R12001	We first took a proteomic approach to look for global patterns in how the tumor-derived extracellular proteome changes in response to targeted kinase inhibitor treatment, using antibody microarrays to screen 1000 proteins for differential supernatant accumulation following MEKi in the TNBC MDA-MB231 cell line.
PMC5087317	R13000	We next compared the supernatant effects of MEKi with broad-spectrum metalloproteinase inhibition (MPi) using batimastat (BB94), and found similar patterns of widely decreased sheddase substrates amphiregulin (AREG), heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HBEGF), tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), and AXL following inhibitor treatment (Fig. 4B).
PMC5087317	R13004	p38, PI3K, and c-JUN N-terminal kinase (JUN N-terminal kinase) inhibitors also significantly reduced sheddase-substrate accumulation, consistent with previous reports describing their effects on a disintegrin and metalloproteinase activity (15, 33).
PMC5087317	R14013	Taken together, these data provide further evidence that MEKi effects on RTK processing are highly consistent with reduced proteolysis by metalloproteinases.
PMC5087317	R16003	Previous reports have implicated signaling of JUN N-terminal kinase and its substrate cJUN in MAPKi resistance (35), and here we found p-cJUN consistently increased with MEKi treatment more than 5 other canonical signaling pathways averaged across 8 cell lines; p-Akt was also consistently elevated (Fig.
PMC5087317	R16005	In response to MPi, JUN N-terminal kinase and cJUN phosphorylation were among the strongest correlates with fluctuating surface AXL and p-AXL levels compared to 21 other signaling measurements across 13 cell lines (Fig.
PMC5087317	R16014	Compensatory JUN N-terminal kinase signaling in response to MAPKi leads to a synergistic response to dual JUN N-terminal kinase and MAPK inhibition (35), and our data suggest that sheddase activity is a key feedback component driving this synergistic interaction.
PMC5087317	R16015	To test this model, we measured the degree of drug synergy as a response to combination MAPKi and JNKi treatment, in the presence or absence of MPi, and found that the degree of synergy between JNKi and MAPKi is strongly reduced in the absence of metalloproteinase activity (Fig.
PMC5087317	R17007	This analysis revealed that synergistic interactions between MEKi and AXLi were substantially reduced in the absence of metalloproteinase activity (Fig.
PMC5087317	R20008	5D–E) and demonstrate AXL upregulation as significantly counteracting the anti-proliferative capacity of metalloproteinase inhibitors.

PMC5191879	I02001	All biomarkers which are currently available, such as 14-3-3, total tau (tau), S-100 calcium-binding protein B (S-100B), alpha-synuclein or neuron specific enolase (neuron specific enolase) and the recently established in vitro amplification assays real time quaking induced conversion (RT-QuIC), have a relative high accuracy but their sensitivities depending from the PRNP codon 129 MV genotype are ranging between 80-90%, which may result in false negative diagnoses [6–15].
PMC5191879	I03000	In this context, a previous high-throughput two-dimensional proteomic approach on sCJD brain homogenates and CSF in our group indicated a regulation of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase 1 (MDH1), an enzyme that reversibly catalyses the oxidation of malate to oxaloacetate (part of many metabolic pathways, including the citric acid cycle)
PMC5191879	I04002	To estimate the association of MDH1 level with other neurodegenerative marker proteins, we additionally performed a correlation analysis between MDH1 and tau, p-tau, 14-3-3, S-100B, neuron specific enolase, Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42 and the Aβ ratio.

PMC5290984	A00005	By global proteomic and phosphoproteomic profiling, we show that, in BL, HSP90 inhibition compromises the activity of the pivotal B-cell antigen receptor (BCR)-proximal effector spleen tyrosine kinase (spleen tyrosine kinase), which we identified as an HSP90 client protein.
PMC5290984	D00000	Our study uncovers a hitherto unknown function for HSP90 in inducing apoptosis of BL cells by disrupting tonic BCR signaling through destabilization of the pivotal BCR transducer kinase spleen tyrosine kinase.
PMC5290984	D01000	By characterizing the molecular consequences of HSP90 inhibition in BL cells, we provide several lines of evidence indicating that spleen tyrosine kinase is a client protein of HSP90.
PMC5290984	D01001	First, HSP90 inhibition strongly reduced spleen tyrosine kinase protein levels in BL cells.
PMC5290984	D01003	Third, we demonstrated the physical interaction between HSP90 and spleen tyrosine kinase and its dependency on the BCR signaling-dependent phosphorylation of HSP90 on Y197.
PMC5290984	D02000	As expected from the broad chaperoning activity of HSP90, BCR effector kinases other than spleen tyrosine kinase, such as LYN, Bruton's tyrosine kinase, and AKT, become less stable after HSP90 inhibition.
PMC5290984	D02001	However, although downregulation of AKT might further support the proapoptotic effect of HSP90 inhibitors in some BL cell lines (Figure 1A), LYN and Bruton's tyrosine kinase are unlikely to play a major role in this process because neither Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibition nor LYN downregulation by shRNA affected the survival of BL cells.
PMC5290984	D04000	The potential synergism between inhibitors targeting HSP90 and specific BCR-dependent kinases should be explored in future studies.
PMC5290984	D04001	Because HSP90 inhibitors target several important BCR signaling effectors at once, they might also become a valuable tool in the context of kinase inhibitor resistance, which is driven by mutations in the target kinase itself or bypass mechanisms through other cell survival promoting kinases.33-35

PMC5290984	I03001	We observed a strong efficacy of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors and found that HSP90 inhibition leads to apoptosis in BL cells by interfering with spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK)-mediated tonic BCR signaling.

PMC5290984	R02006	Consistently, a quantitative proteome analysis revealed downregulation of several BCR-proximal kinases including spleen tyrosine kinase, Src family tyrosine-protein kinase Lyn (LYN), and Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) upon HSP90 inhibition (Figure 2C).
PMC5290984	R02009	In addition, spleen tyrosine kinase downregulation was confirmed in vitro after AT13387 treatment of primary BL cells purified from 2 patients with bone marrow involvement (Figure 2E).
PMC5290984	R03000	The effect of HSP90 inhibition on the pivotal BCR-proximal kinases LYN, spleen tyrosine kinase, and Bruton's tyrosine kinase was furthermore reflected by an attenuated BCR signaling response upon BCR stimulation.
PMC5290984	R03001	BCR-stimulated BL cells showed reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (extracellular signal regulated kinase) and AKT (Figure 3A-B) as well as reduced Ca2+
PMC5290984	R04001	Flow cytometric analysis indicated that HSP90 inhibitors do not affect the expression of the BCR on the plasma membrane (Figure 4A); therefore, we focused on the BCR-proximal kinases that are downregulated upon HSP90 inhibition (Figure 2C).
PMC5290984	R04002	Neither Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibition by the small molecule PCI-32765 (ibrutinib) (median IC50, 7.51 µM; see Figure 1A) nor downregulation of LYN by inducible Lyn-specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (Figure 4B-C) affected BL cell viability.
PMC5290984	R04003	In contrast, spleen tyrosine kinase inhibition negatively affected BL cell viability in a manner similar to HSP90 inhibition (Figure 4D).
PMC5290984	R04004	The congruent effects of HSP90 and spleen tyrosine kinase inhibition led us to examine whether spleen tyrosine kinase is chaperoned by HSP90.
PMC5290984	R04005	By coimmunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting, we found that spleen tyrosine kinase and HSP90 interact at the protein level (Figure 4E-F).
PMC5290984	R04006	This result, along with reduced spleen tyrosine kinase expression upon HSP90 inhibition (Figure 2C-E), suggests that spleen tyrosine kinase is a client protein of HSP90 in BL.

PMC5290984	R05002	Because interactions between HSP90 and several client proteins depend on posttranslational modifications of HSP90,27,28 we tested whether Y197 phosphorylation is required for the interaction between HSP90 and spleen tyrosine kinase.

PMC5417820	M11001	After 48 h of differentiation in the presence or absence of kinase inhibitor, adherent cells were detached with trypsin, and 5 × 104 cells in 100 μl of fresh RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 nm PMA, and 1 μm kinase inhibitor or DMSO were seeded per well in a 96-well microtiter plate.
PMC5417820	M14000	For identification of proteins significantly regulated due to the presence of kinase inhibitor during differentiation, we compared the 48-h time point of normally differentiated cells and cells differentiated in the presence of kinase inhibitors from two biological replicates.
PMC5417820	R00003	Alternatively, glycosylated peptides can be eluted upon deglycosylation with PNGase F (5).
PMC5417820	R00007	The specificity of the approach could be further improved to 84% protein abundance of plasma membrane proteins when peptides were specifically eluted with PNGase F after trypsinization (Fig.
PMC5417820	R00011	PNGase F elution of bound peptides could enable the identification of glycosylation sites, as PNGase F cleavage induces deamidation of Asn to Asp with a mass shift of +0.98 Da.
PMC5417820	R00015	We note that the specific release of intact proteins from streptavidin beads by PNGase F was not successful in our hands.
PMC5417820	R00016	When comparing both elution methods, analyzing all tryptic peptides yielded more than twice as many plasma membrane proteins as the PNGase F strategy (on average 781 versus 337, Fig. 1, C and D), and protein identifications were based on nearly twice as many unique peptides, on average (10.2 versus 5.7, supplemental Fig.
PMC5417820	R00018	Because of the substantially higher coverage achieved and the modest loss in specificity, the PNGase F digestion step was omitted in the following experiments, and analyses were focused on the complete sets of tryptic peptides generated by on-bead proteolysis from individual samples.
PMC5417820	R03005	In the combined dataset, we identified a total of 2431 plasma membrane proteins, including 604 receptors, 307 transporters, 502 enzymes, 768 proteins with other molecular functions such as GTPase activation, developmental protein, cytokine, or chaperone, and 250 proteins with no annotated molecular function (Fig. 1E).
PMC5417820	R07001	For example, the urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor PLAUR was found 28-fold up-regulated, whereas its negative regulator, the c-type mannose receptor MRC2 that controls the extracellular level of PLAUR (54), was 5-fold reduced during differentiation.
PMC5417820	R09000	In the combined dataset, abundance profiles were generated for 68 plasma membrane-associated kinases.
PMC5417820	R09001	Among these, 14 kinases were significantly regulated after 24 h during monocyte to macrophage differentiation, including KIT and ephrin receptors EPHA3, EPHA7, and EPHB1 (Fig. 5B and supplemental Fig.
PMC5417820	R09003	We next tested how cells react to perturbation of signaling processes specific to the monocyte to macrophage differentiation with small molecule kinase inhibitors.
PMC5417820	R09004	Treatment of THP-1 cells with the BCR-Abl inhibitor imatinib (56), the broad specificity inhibitor sunitinib (57), and the ABL and Src family kinase inhibitor dasatinib (58) did not affect the morphology, viability, and proliferation of undifferentiated THP-1 cells within 48 h (Fig.
PMC5417820	R11002	S5 and supplemental Table S5) (64) suggested that neither Abl kinase inhibition nor any of the other kinases affected by imatinib or sunitinib are responsible for the observed dysregulation of the differentiation program.
PMC5417820	R11003	Ephrin receptor tyrosine kinases are potently inhibited by dasatinib but not by imatinib or sunitinib.
PMC5417820	R11004	Because of the observed regulation of ephrin receptors during macrophage differentiation, and the established role of ephrins for regulation of cell differentiation (65) and regulation of bone homeostasis (66), it seems very likely that off-target inhibition of ephrin kinases by dasatinib caused dysregulated macrophage differentiation.
PMC5420129	A02000	Among proteins upregulated in C4–2 and C4–2B cells than in LNCaP cells, we focused on gamma-glutamyltransferase 1 (GGT1), a cell-surface enzyme that regulates the catabolism of extracellular glutathione.

PMC5450719	D01001	It is notable that, despite T. mossambicanus having a lower concentration of snake venom metalloprotease due to its greater venom complexity, it displayed a higher relative rate of metalloprotease activity in addition to being more potently coagulotoxic (Figure 4, Figure 7 and Figure 8).
PMC5450719	D01002	Further, T. mossambicanus possesses two distinct molecular weight classes of snake venom metalloprotease as opposed to the single band present in D. typus venom (Figure 2).

PMC5450719	R01002	While both 1D and 2D gels indicate that both species are dominated by P-III snake venom metalloprotease (Figure 2 and Figure 3, Supplementary Data), T. mossambicanus also contained phospholipase A2 (PLA2 Type IIE) in high amounts.
PMC5450719	R01004	The molecular weights of identified P-III snake venom metalloprotease correspond to previous transcriptome and proteome data for D. typus [24].
PMC5450719	R02000	Despite T. mossambicanus having a more complex venom profile than D. typus, and thus lower relative amounts of P-III snake venom metalloprotease (Supplementary Data), it actually displayed a higher rate of cleavage of a matrix metalloprotease specific substrate (Figure 4).

PMC5482139	R03002	The ratios of haptoglobin, lipoprotein lipase and the fibrinogen subunit (alpha chain, beta chain and gamma chain) were 0.48, 2.31, 1.48, 1.71 and 1.53, respectively, compared to the control group (Table II).
PMC5482139	R03004	In accordance with the result from MS analysis, haptoglobin was significantly downregulated in OHSS patients, while lipoprotein lipase and fibrinogen were upregulated, compared with the control group (Fig. 3).
PMC5482139	R04000	ROC curve analysis revealed that the relative expression level of haptoglobin, fibrinogen and lipoprotein lipase in serum performed more accurately for OHSS prediction.
PMC5482139	R04003	In addition, lipoprotein lipase may discriminate OHSS from control patients; the specificity, sensitivity and AUC value were 0.775, 0.907 and 0.882, respectively (Fig. 4C).
PMC5490578	A00007	The intake of PhyS-milk did not induce changes in the lipid associated plasma protein fraction, whereas ω3-milk significantly increased apolipoprotein (Apo)- E LDL content (p = 0.043) and induced a coordinated increase in several HDL-associated proteins, Apo A–I, lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase (lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase), paraoxonase-1 (PON-1), Apo D, and Apo L1 (p < 0.05 for all).
PMC5490578	A00009	Serum amyloid P component (SAP) was reduced in the LPDP protein fraction (p = 0.001) of subjects taking PhyS-milk and C-C motif chemokine 2 (CCL2)expression detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis in white blood cells was significantly reduced (p = 0.013).
PMC5490578	D05006	Lipid-free Apo A–I produces the nascent HDL particles and lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase catalyzes HDL maturation by the esterification of free cholesterol (FC) into cholesteryl esters (CE), being both particles accumulated into the core of the HDL particle.
PMC5490578	D05008	lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase is essential for cholesterol esterification, but also needs the presence of other proteins to be activated.
PMC5490578	D05009	Thus, Apo A–I and Apo E are the best lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase activators in plasma and PON-1 protects lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase from its inactivation
PMC5490578	D05012	Interestingly, in the present study we have found that ω3-milk intake significantly increases the HDL content of key proteins involved in HDL metabolism such as Apo A–I and lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase.
PMC5490578	D05014	Thus, it is conceivable that ω3 by increasing Apo A–I and lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase levels enhances both cholesterol esterification and transport, significantly improving the lipoprotein profile (Figure 7).
PMC5490578	D05015	Furthermore, the ω3-milk-induced increase observed in PON1 could not only enhance lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase activity but could also improve the anti-oxidant abilities of HDL particles.
PMC5490578	D05017	Apo D has been implicated in the reduction of TG plasma levels and also binds to lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase improving its esterification activity [59].
PMC5490578	D05020	Apo L1 is mainly studied in chronic kidney disease, but studies in our group showed that a coordinated decrease in HDL content of both lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase and Apo L1 seem to predispose to the presentation of acute ischemic events in hypercholesterolemia patients [24].

PMC5490578	I04001	In fact, the association of lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase, PON-1, and Apo A–I have been shown to increase the time span of HDL protection against LDL oxidation [18].
PMC5490578	R01002	Furthermore, there was a coordinated increase of two important enzymes involved in HDL metabolism, lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase (p = 0.044; Figure 3b) and PON-1 (p = 0.047; Figure 3c).
PMC5490578	R02000	In order to analyze if the observed HDL-associated protein changes were translated into changes in total serum protein levels, Apo A–I and lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase serum levels were measured with commercial ELISAs in the whole study population.
PMC5490578	R02001	This analysis revealed a lack of differences in both Apo A–I and lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase (Figure 4a) total serum levels after ω3-milk intake when compared to basal levels.
PMC5490578	R02002	However, and as observed with Apo E, if only those subjects with a reduction on TG levels were analyzed, a non-significant trend to increased Apo A–I levels (p = 0.099) and a significant increase in lecitin cholesterol acyltransferase levels (p = 0.0397; Figure 4b) after the intake of ω3-milk was observed.

PMC5516978	A00003	Seven E. cuniculi proteins were identified at one-dimensional gel regions where specific seropositive reaction was observed by Western blot, including polar tube protein 3, polar tube protein 2, and for the first time reported: heat shock related 70kDa protein, polysaccharide deacetylase domain-containing protein, zinc finger protein, spore wall and anchoring disk complex protein EnP1, and translation elongation factor 1 alpha.
PMC5516978	A00005	This included serum paraoxonase, alpha-1-antiproteinase F precursor and alpha-1-antiproteinase S-1 which have presumptive catalytic activity likely related to infection control, and cystatin fetuin-B-type, an enzyme regulator that has been poorly studied to date.
PMC5516978	D01007	Furthermore, we also described polysaccharide deacetylase domain-containing protein is targeted by the immune response perhaps because it acts during the sporogonial stage by protecting the microsporidian chitin layer from hydrolysis by mammalian chitinases.
PMC5516978	D02003	In addition to two proteins of the hemoglobin complex, as well as some others including immunoglobulin gamma-chain C-region and cystatin fetuin B-type, five had putative catalytic activity: alpha-1-antiproteinase precursor, alpha-1-antiproteinase S-1, haptoglobin, serum paraoxonase/arylesterase and ceruloplasmin.
PMC5516978	D02004	The former two both belong to the serine-protease inhibitor (serpin) superfamily, also referred to as serum trypsin inhibitors [40].
PMC5516978	D02006	In a previous study, incubation of E. cuniculi spores with trypsin was shown to have impact on their virulence [41], so it may be proposed that the increasing levels of host enzymes of the serpin family, like alpha-1-antiproteinase precursor and alpha-1-antiproteinase, may play a role in the in vivo regulation of the inflammatory response during encephalitozoonosis in rabbits.
PMC5516978	D02007	Paraoxonase is a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) associated with serum enzymes [42].
PMC5516978	D02009	Interestingly, resveratrol, a plant-derived phenolic compound, was previously shown to express an inhibitory action on E. cuniculi, and the paraoxonase was then thought to be involved in its possible pathway of action [44].
PMC5516978	D03004	Likewise, kininogen 1, alpha-2-macroglobulin, apolipoprotein A-I, and alpha-1-antiproteinase E have also been sporadically reported to be increased in infectious diseases [55], but their concomitant association which appeared specific during neurological clinical signalmen of E. cuniculi active infection is novel in such a context.
PMC5516978	D03008	The detection of increased kininogen 1 in the current study may be the result of a host defense mechanism of generating pro-inflammatory bradykinin-related peptides at the sites of infection, since some virulence factors, like secreted aspartic proteases of pathogens, were shown in an experimental model of candidiasis to induce host kininogen proteolysis.

PMC5516978	R03003	Five of these proteins have a putative catalytic activity: alpha-1-antiproteinase F precursor, alpha-1-antiproteinase S-1, serum paraoxonase/arylesterase, haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin, while the two latter are also theoretically involved in protein and metal-ion binding, respectively.

PMC5624401	A00003	We identified new candidates from a TBI CSF proteome by selecting trauma-released, astrocyte-enriched proteins including aldolase C (ALDOC), its 38kD breakdown product (BDP), brain lipid binding protein (BLBP), astrocytic phosphoprotein (PEA15), glutamine synthetase (glutamine synthetase) and new 18-25kD-GFAP-BDPs.
PMC5624401	D06000	Astrocytes maintain high rates of active oxidative glucose metabolism, express high levels of glycolytic and tricarboxyl acid cycle enzymes and carry many mitochondria.26,31 glutamine synthetase and BLBP have vital roles in glutamate recycling and fatty acid uptake at the tripartite synapse.73,74 ALDOC provides the substrate for lactate and ATP production and its product glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate controls cell fate and astrocyte-neuron crosstalk.75 PEA15 regulates glucose metabolism, provides resistance to glucose deprivation and adapts cells to changing metabolic states.76,77 Astrocytes can regulate neuronal metabolic supply by adjusting local blood flow on demand because they ensheath synapses as well as capillaries.74,78 Thus, astroglial metabolism is essential for maintaining neuro-metabolic coupling and brain energy homeostasis.

PMC5624401	I02000	Many studies have been conducted to identify new neurotrauma protein biomarker candidates.15,16 GFAP, neuron specific enolase, neurofilaments, tau, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase (UCHL1) and S100 β have been previously chosen for their neuropathological presence.
PMC5624401	R00004	To further improve specificity, we determined astrocyte-enriched proteins using published gene array data and excluded proteins found in plasma from healthy individuals or are abundant outside the CNS.31,41–44 From this, four astroglial injury-associated proteins were identified: (1) aldolase C (ALDOC), which is exceptional, both in astrocyte enrichment and abundance among brain proteins,30,45 (2) glutamine synthetase (GS, also known as GLNA), (3) brain lipid binding protein (BLBP, also known as brain fatty acid binding protein, FABP7) and (4) astrocytic phosphoprotein 15 (PEA15).
PMC5624401	R01003	The CSF levels of the new astroglial biomarkers, ALDOC, glutamine synthetase, BLBP and PEA15 were measured and compared with two previously studied ones, GFAP and S100 β.
PMC5624401	R01006	The abundant CSF protein prostaglandin synthase (prostaglandin synthase) served as a CSF standard.
PMC5624401	R01008	ALDOC and glutamine synthetase were persistently elevated up to five days post injury, while GFAP and S100 β decreased on the second post-injury day.
PMC5624401	R01012	The CSF from a control subject had high levels of prostaglandin synthase, whereas prostaglandin synthase was not detected on injury day and its levels recovered over subsequent days in the CSF of a TBI patient (Figure 1(a)).
PMC5624401	R02000	Sub-saturated CSF immunoblotting densitometry showed mean increases in TBI subjects of three (GFAP, S100 β, glutamine synthetase and BLBP) to four (ALDOC) orders of magnitude, while PEA15 and APOB were not detected in control subjects (Figure 1(d) to (​(j)).j)).
PMC5624401	R02005	glutamine synthetase and BLBP varied more between TBI patients, yet also without significant mean decreases on later post-injury days (Figure 1(g) to (​(h)).h)).
PMC5624401	R02008	Mean prostaglandin synthase levels were invariably high among controls and decreased significantly after TBI on early post-injury days (Figure 1(k)).
PMC5624401	R02009	Preliminary analysis of this cohort shows that mean prostaglandin synthase levels recovered in TBI survivors, while levels declined further in nonsurvivors (Supplementary Figure S4(a)).
PMC5624401	R04002	From MRM-MS measurements, GFAP and ALDOC had greater levels in TBI CSF than in control CSF (Figure 2(a); similar data for PEA15, BLBP and glutamine synthetase are not shown).
PMC5624401	R04003	In addition, longitudinal CSF profiles showed matching trends between immunoblot and MRM-MS measurements for a severe TBI survivor, as documented for GFAP and ALDOC (Figure 2(b); BLBP and glutamine synthetase also had matching longitudinal trends between the two methods, not shown).
PMC5624401	R04006	Injury day CSF levels were highest for ALDOC with GFAP next in order, while BLBP and glutamine synthetase levels were significantly lower (Figure 2(d)).
PMC5624401	R05001	BLBP and PEA15 correlated robustly with each other as did ALDOC and glutamine synthetase, indicating similar kinetics between these marker pairs.
PMC5624401	R05003	Astroglial biomarker levels correlated negatively with prostaglandin synthase, representing injured versus healthy conditions.
PMC5624401	R06001	This unsupervised analysis grouped nine neurotrauma markers into two factors, with CSF standard prostaglandin synthase resulting in a third factor.
PMC5624401	R06003	Factor A comprised GFAP, its lower BDPs, S100 β and APOB, while Factor B contained ALDOC, its 38kD fragment, BLBP, glutamine synthetase, and PEA15 (Figure 3(a)).

PMC5625392	R03000	A new top marker more abundant in TB than non-TB samples was SYWC, a gamma interferon (IFN-γ)-inducible Trp-tRNA-synthetase associated with stress response.
PMC5625392	R04009	This optimal model contained 6 host response proteins (HR6 model): SYWC, kallistatin, C9, gelsolin, testican-2, and aldolase C. Four of the six biomarkers had been part of the previous HR9 model from phase I, and SYWC and aldolase C were discovered in the larger, 4,000-plex SOMAscan used in phase II and provided additional sensitivity and specificity to the model.

PMC5826843	R05005	In the granular compartment, significant differences were observed for lactoferrin and myeloperoxidase.
PMC5826843	R05006	Notably, higher amounts of myeloperoxidase were observed in spontaneous NETs isolated from patients with AAV or SLE.
PMC5826843	R06000	When comparing NET contents in patients with AAV versus SLE, there was a significantly greater amount of lactoferrin, H2A, S100A8, and S100A9 in NETs from unstimulated neutrophils in SLE and significantly greater myeloperoxidase, H2b, H4, and S100A12 in NETs from unstimulated neutrophils in AAV.

PMC5830394	I02004	In mice, clearance of pyrenocytes occurs via TAM-receptors on the central macrophages that recognize and bind phosphatidylserine (PS) exposed on pyrenocytes resulting in phagocytosis in a protein S-dependent manner.18,19 The TAM-receptor family of tyrosine kinases (TYRO3, AXL, and MERTK) play an important role in the phagocytic ability of macrophages as triple knock-out mice fail to clear apoptotic cells in multiple tissues.
PMC5830394	M06000	Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed as previously described.12 Values were normalized using S18 and HPRT as a reference gene and calibrated relative to expression of CD14+ monocytes at day 0 (primers listed in Online Supplementary Methods).
PMC5830394	R01012	A range of pro-inflammatory proteins, clustered within an interactome node, were downregulated; these include lysosomal enzymes HEXA and HEXB, MANBA, saponin PSAP and GLB1, in addition to other lysosome/hydrolase activity-related GO-categories (Figure 2D,E).
PMC5830394	R03001	In mice, pyrenocytes are phagocytosed by central macrophages in a Mer tyrosine kinase (MERTK)-dependent manner.18 RT-PCR showed that GC-macrophages upregulate both Mer tyrosine kinase and AXL mRNA compared to freshly isolated and non-glucocorticoid stimulated monocytes (Figure 4A).
PMC5830394	R03002	Mer tyrosine kinase expression was inhibited by mifepristone treatment during the first three days of culture, whereas AXL was not, suggesting that AXL expression is induced via a trans-regulated process while Mer tyrosine kinase needs the transcriptional activity of the glucocorticoid receptor.

PMC5833473	R06000	Previously, we have shown that control neutrophils during 20 min of adhesion to fibronectin secreted lactoferrin (LF), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), lysozyme, and myeloperoxidase (myeloperoxidase), as well as albumin and cytosolic S100A8 and S100A9 proteins [40, 41].
PMC5833473	R06003	Nevertheless, LF and NGAL are considered components of the secondary granules, myeloperoxidase is contained mainly in the primary granules, and albumin belongs to secretory vesicles.
PMC5833473	R07000	When neutrophils adhere to fibronectin in the presence of E2, they release the same proteins as the control cells (LF, albumin, NGAL, S100A8, and S100A9) and, in addition, metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) (Figure 3(a), Table 2).
PMC5833473	R07001	MMP-9 is localized presumably in the tertiary or gelatinase granules of neutrophils [43].
PMC5833473	R07002	Metalloproteinases are involved in the adhesion and migration of neutrophils because of their ability to modulate the extracellular matrix and remove the barriers of the basement membranes [44].
PMC5833473	R08000	Neutrophils that adhered to fibronectin in the presence of insulin secreted the same proteins as the control cells and, in addition, MMP-9 and matrix metalloproteinase 8 (MMP-8) (Figure 3(b); Table 2).
PMC5833473	R08001	MMP-8, or neutrophil collagenase, is involved in degradation of all structural components of extracellular matrix and plays a crucial role in many physiological processes including inflammatory and cardiovascular disorders [46].
PMC5833473	R11001	Cathepsin G is one of the three serine proteases (along with proteinase-3 and elastase) that are contained in primary (azurophil) granules of neutrophils and involved in clearance of internalized pathogens, proteolytic modification of chemokines and cytokines, and shedding of cell surface receptors [55].
PMC5833473	R14004	Insulin and E2 can alter the adhesion of neutrophils initiating the secretion of metalloproteinase, which modifies extracellular matrix proteins.
PMC5853081	A02002	The resulting digestion pattern differed from that brought about by kallikrein, a host serine protease that normally acts on HK to release the vasodilator bradykinin.
PMC5853081	A03000	Since proteomic and biochemical studies have revealed that the schistosome tegument contains two cysteine proteases belonging to the calpain family (SmCalp1 and SmCalp2) we conclude that these are likely responsible for the HK cleavage reported here.
PMC5853081	D04012	Whether further cleavage of the schistosome-generated HK fragments by host proteases leads to the eventual release of bradykinin is not known.
PMC5853081	D04013	One caveat arises from the report that an S. mansoni prolyl oligopeptidase (Schistosome mansoni prolyl oligopeptidase) can degrade bradykinin [22].
PMC5853081	D04015	Nonetheless, live adult worms are reported to cleave bradykinin suggesting that Schistosome mansoni prolyl oligopeptidase on worms can access the peptide [22].
PMC5853081	D04016	These data leave open the unlikely possibility that schistosomes can generate bradykinin, but it is rapidly broken down via Schistosome mansoni prolyl oligopeptidase.
PMC5853081	D07001	Since the host HK cleaving enzyme kallikrein is a serine protease, we first set out to determine if the worms also possessed surface serine proteases that might be responsible for HK cleavage.
PMC5853081	D07004	This result provides strong evidence for the view that schistosome cysteine proteases are responsible for HK cleavage.
PMC5853081	D07005	This result is also consistent with tegumental proteomic work which places cysteine proteases belonging to the calpain family in the parasite surface membranes but no serine proteases there [24, 25].
PMC5853081	D07006	Calpains are calcium-dependent cysteine proteases that engage in limited cleavage of their target proteins [33–35].

PMC5853614	D03000	One of the antigens identified in our analysis is sialidase, also known as neuraminidase (nanH).
PMC5853614	D03002	Sialidases, which have highly conserved essential catalytic residues, are widely distributed in nature and are virulence factors required for mucosal colonization in a wide variety of pathogens including Clostridium perfringens, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Salmonella Typhimurium, and influenza virus [36, 37].
PMC5853614	D03003	The antigenically distinct sialidase of V. cholerae is present in all toxigenic strains and facilitates CT binding to host intestinal epithelial cells by converting cell surface polysialogangliosides to GM1 monogangliosides, the epithelial surface receptor for CT [37].

PMC5853614	D06001	The phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a multiprotein phosphotransfer cascade that is not only involved in transport of carbohydrates, but also involved in regulatory functions, including those involved in virulence, biofilm formation, and chemotaxis [44–46].
PMC5853614	D06003	protein phosphotransferase (EINtr) is part of the nitrogen PTS that contains homologues to the sugar PTS: EINtr, NPr, and EIIANtr
PMC5853614	D06006	We detected both significant systemic and mucosal humoral reactivity to protein phosphotransferase, suggesting that it may be highly expressed in vivo and may play a role in utilizing alternative nutrient sources during infection or have an unidentified regulatory function in humans during V. cholerae infection.
PMC5853614	D06008	Thus far in V. cholerae, it has been demonstrated that protein phosphotransferase is not required for intestinal colonization [44].

PMC5853614	M07001	Antigen-specific responses were detected by adding 100 µL of plasma (diluted 1:100, sialidase, FlaC, and FlaD; 1:200 HlyA); ALS (diluted 1:1), or BMEM ALS (undiluted) to the plate.
PMC5853614	M07002	Bound antibodies were detected with antihuman IgG and IgA conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at a 1:1000 dilution, and peroxidase activity was measured with the substrate 2,2-azinobis (ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid) for plasma and o-phenylenediamine for ALS and BMEM ALS.
PMC5853614	R00004	In addition, among our top hits were phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase (protein phosphotransferase), diaminobutyrate–2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (VBIVibCho83274_1553), sialidase (nanH), outer membrane protein OmpV, flagellin B (FlaB), FlaC, FlaD, and hemolysin-related protein VBIVibCho83274_1804.
PMC5853614	R01002	One-third (n = 13) of these antigens were also differentially reactive in plasma, and our top hits in ALS included V. cholerae LPS, OSP, MP, CTB, TcpA, sialidase, HlyA, protein phosphotransferase, diaminobutyrate–2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase, the A subunit of cholera toxin, FlaC, and FlaD.
PMC5853614	R02000	To validate the responses identified using our microarray-based screening, we selected 4 reactive proteins showing a range of immunoreactivity in our microarray analysis to confirm via ELISA: HlyA, sialidase, FlaC, and FlaD. Cholera patients (n = 13) developed a significant plasma IgG and IgA response by day 7 of infection to each of the recombinant antigens, except for IgA reactivity with sialidase (Figure 3).
PMC5853614	R02001	In this cholera-endemic area, measurable plasma antibody responses to FlaC, FlaD, and sialidase were present in healthy individuals.
PMC5853614	R03001	Mucosal ALS IgG immunoreactivity was significant for sialidase; however, in this small cohort, mucosal ALS IgA responses to sialidase and IgG and IgA responses to FlaC did not reach statistical significance (Figure 4B and ​and4D4D).
PMC5853614	R04000	To determine whether HlyA, sialidase, FlaC, and FlaD generated long-lived antibody responses, we assessed BMEM ALS responses on day 2 and day 30 via ELISA in 12 cholera patients (Figure 5A–D).
PMC5853614	R04001	Significant BMEM ALS IgG responses were seen at day 30 to HlyA, sialidase, and FlaC. For BMEM ALS IgA responses, only HlyA and FlaC reached statistical significance; however, a trend toward statistical significance was observed for sialidase (P = .0640)

PMC5916823	D01004	Here, we converted the stapled MCL-1 BH3 helix into a proteomic discovery tool that identified very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase as the only interacting protein located in the mitochondrial matrix.
PMC5916823	D01005	Indeed, the corroboration between MCL-1 SAHBD and expressed full-length MCL-1 protein, and MCL-1Matrix in particular, in engaging very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase indicates that stapled peptide helices can serve as high-fidelity proteomic tools to uncover and catalog the protein targets of structured interaction motifs.
PMC5916823	D02000	The unexpected link between MCL-1 and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase potentially provides a unifying mechanism for phenotypic outcomes shared by the two proteins.
PMC5916823	D02001	For example, conditional deletion of Mcl-1 or Acadvl (very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase) in murine cardiomyocytes leads to dilated cardiomyopathy (Wang et al., 2013; Xiong et al., 2014), which is also seen in children with the severe form of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency (Strauss et al., 1995).
PMC5916823	D02002	very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase is bound to the inner mitochondrial membrane and catalyzes the first of four steps of fatty acid β-oxidation, dehydrogenating the C2–C3 bond of fatty acyl-CoA chains containing 14–20 carbons.
PMC5916823	D02004	The cardiac damage sustained as a result of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency derives both from energy depletion and toxicity from the accumulated long-chain fatty acids and carnitine derivatives (Wajner and Amaral, 2015).
PMC5916823	D02006	Proteolytic processing of the MCL-1 amino terminus upon mitochondrial import yields a 36 kD isoform that, like very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, is tethered to the inner mitochondrial membrane and exposed to the matrix (Perciavalle et al., 2012).
PMC5916823	D02008	Here, we find that, in contrast to very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, the absence of MCL-1Matrix results in hyperactivity of β-oxidation of long-chain fatty acids, which may also be detrimental due to substrate overconsumption and/or co-factor depletion.
PMC5916823	D02010	Intriguingly, our structural analyses place the MCL-1 BH3 helix in direct proximity to the enzyme active site and adjacent to an unstructured region thought to tether very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to the inner mitochondrial membrane (McAndrew et al., 2008).
PMC5916823	D02011	Thus, it is tempting to speculate that the phenotypic overlap in mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiac pathology observed for very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and MCL-1 deficiencies may be driven, at least in part, by a role for MCL-1Matrix in tuning very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity.
PMC5916823	D03010	Whereas small-molecule inhibitors of the MCL-1 groove effectively neutralize its pathologic anti-apoptotic functionality in cancer, targeting the distinct interaction between MCL-1Matrix and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase may provide a therapeutic opportunity to disrupt cancer metabolism by deregulating long-chain fatty acid β-oxidation.

Densitometry analyses were performed using ImageJ software.
PMC5916823	M09000	Human very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase lacking its cleavable leader sequence (aa 40-655; NCBI: NP_000009.1) was subcloned into the pET19b vector (Millipore, Cat# 69677-3) using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites, and confirmed by DNA sequencing.

PMC5916823	M09004	Dialyzed very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was concentrated and subjected to size exclusion chromatography (GE Healthcare Life Sciences; Superdex 200 10/300 GL) at 4°C using a 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0 buffer.
PMC5916823	M09005	Protein identification and purity was confirmed by intact mass spectrometry, SDS-PAGE, and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase western blot analysis.

PMC5916823	M12000	Fluorinated SAHB (25 μM) and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (0–125 μM) were mixed in very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase FPLC buffer containing 10% (v/v) D2O to a final volume of 500
PMC5916823	M13001	Super streptavidin (SSA) sensors (Forte Bio, Cat# 18-5057) were pre-soaked in very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase FPLC buffer for at least 10 min prior to use, loaded with 5 μg/mL biotin-PEG-MCL-1 SAHBs for 400 sec, quenched with 0.1 mg/mL biocytin (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat# B4261) for 120 sec, and washed with very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase FPLC buffer for 120 sec.
PMC5916823	M13002	The sensors were then transferred into serial dilutions (starting at 30 μM) of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase for 1800 sec.
PMC5916823	M14000	Recombinant very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein (10 μM) and biotinylated pSAHB (40 μM) were mixed in 3 mL of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase FPLC buffer, incubated at 4°C overnight, and irradiated (365 nm, Spectroline Handheld UV Lamp Model En280L, Spectronics) for 2 hours on ice (Braun et al., 2010).
PMC5916823	M14001	Unreacted peptide was removed by overnight dialysis at 4°C using 10 kDa molecular-weight cutoff Slide-A-Lyzer™ dialysis cassettes into very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase FPLC buffer.
PMC5916823	M14004	To remove uncrosslinked very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase peptides, the beads were then washed at room temperature three times each in 1% (v/v) SDS in PBS, 1 M NaCl in PBS, and 10% (v/v) ethanol in PBS.
PMC5916823	M15001	The sequence was docked to the crystal structure of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (PDB: 3B96) using the HADDOCK 2.2 webserver default parameters (van Zundert et al., 2016).
PMC5916823	M20000	very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzymatic activity was measured as previously described (Doulias et al., 2013; Lehman et al., 1990).
PMC5916823	M20002	The reaction was initiated by addition of purified recombinant very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein (final concentration of 0.72 μM) that had been incubated overnight at 4°C with either vehicle (1.5% [v/v] DMSO) or MCL-1 SAHB (final concentration of 72 μM).
PMC5916823	R00006	Of the 49 candidates that met our high stringency criteria, only one was a matrix-resident protein, namely very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, which demonstrated an average spectral count of 27 in MCL-1 SAHBD pull-downs compared to 0 for the corresponding vehicle control samples, and 49% sequence coverage (Figure 1C, Table S2).
PMC5916823	R01000	To validate very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase as a specific hit, we repeated the streptavidin pull-down experiments using MEF lysates and a series of SAHBs representing the diverse sequence compositions of MCL-1, BIM, BID, and BAD BH3 domains (Figure 1D).
PMC5916823	R01001	Whereas the SAHB panel faithfully recapitulated the physiologic binding selectivities of BH3 domains for MCL-1 interaction, only MCL-1 SAHBD pulled down endogenous very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Figure 1D).
PMC5916823	R01002	To rule out a sequence-independent role for the MCL-1 SAHBD pull-down based on its distinct staple location, we confirmed that an MCL-1 SAHB bearing an all-hydrocarbon staple in the “A” position (flanking the conserved I/V/M-G-D motif) found in the BIM, BID, and BAD constructs also engaged very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, whereas a BIM SAHB bearing a staple in the same position as MCL-1 SAHBD (flanking R-N-H in MCL-1 and A-Y-Y in BIM) did not pull down very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Figure S2).
PMC5916823	R01003	We further found that MCL-1 SAHBD selectively bound to very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase but not to other members of the acyl-CoA dehydrogenase family, such as MCAD and SCAD (Figures 1E, S1F–G).
PMC5916823	R01004	Finally, in advance of drilling down on the binding determinants of the interaction and its mechanistic role, we confirmed by proteomic analysis that FLAG-MCL-1 (full-length protein), reconstituted into Mcl-1−/− murine livers, also pulled down native very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and established physiologic interactors of MCL-1, such as BIM and PUMA, and not MCAD or SCAD (Figure 1F).
PMC5916823	R01005	This selective very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase interaction profile, obtained using MCL-1 protein and MCL-1 SAHBD, further validated the fidelity of a stapled peptide α-helix as a proteomic discovery tool.
PMC5916823	R02000	To dissect a mechanistic role for MCL-1 in regulating very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, we first conducted a series of binding assays to evaluate whether or not the BH3 interaction was direct.
PMC5916823	R02001	We generated full-length, recombinant very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase protein (Figure 2A) and indeed found that Btn-MCL-1 SAHBD directly engaged recombinant very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, whereas BIM, BID and BAD SAHBs showed little to no VLCAD interaction but recapitulated their MCL-1 binding selectivities, as assessed by streptavidin pull-down (Figure 2B).
PMC5916823	R02002	Then, using two additional and distinct methods, 19F-NMR and biolayer interferometry (BLI), we observed direct binding interactions of MCL-1 SAHBD with both recombinant very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and MCL-1ΔNΔC (Figures 2C–F, S3).
PMC5916823	R02003	As a measure of binding specificity, an MCL-1 SAHB bearing a staple in the “B” position (flanking residues T-L-R in MCL-1), which was found to disrupt the interaction with very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase but not MCL-1 in streptavidin pull-downs from MEF lysates (Figure S2), recapitulated this selective binding profile in both 19F-NMR and BLI analyses (Figures 2C–F, S3).
PMC5916823	R03001	In comparing the binding activities toward native very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and MCL-1, we observed a series of alanine mutants that disrupted both binding interactions, but also identified residues that revealed selectivity for each of the targets (Figure 3A–B, Table S1).
PMC5916823	R03002	For example, mutagenesis of L213 - a conserved residue across all BH3 domains – disrupted Btn-MCL-1 SAHBD interaction with very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and MCL-1, whereas alanine mutation of L210 or the previously identified MCL-1 selectivity determinant V220 (Stewart et al., 2010) were uniquely disruptive to very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and MCL-1, respectively.
PMC5916823	R03003	Most striking, the series of disruptive mutations for each target defined partially overlapping binding interfaces that were shifted from one another by approximately 90 degrees (Figures 3A–B), revealing a distinct mode for MCL-1 BH3 interaction with very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase.
PMC5916823	R04000	To localize the region of MCL-1 BH3 interaction on very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, we applied a photoaffinity labeling mass spectrometry approach using a panel of photoreactive SAHB (pSAHB) peptides bearing a benzophenone moiety, and capped with biotin at the N-terminus (Braun et al., 2010).
PMC5916823	R04001	Each pSAHB was incubated with recombinant very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase under UV light, and the peptide fragments that covalently linked to the pSAHB via the benzophenone were identified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS).
PMC5916823	R04002	Whereas MCL-1 pSAHBs D1 and D2 both crosslinked to very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase residues V292 and M294, MCL-1 pSAHBD2 also captured amino acids T240, F242, R246, and G250, and MCL-1 pSAHBD3 crosslinked to S32, F38, and S445 (Figure 4A).
PMC5916823	R04003	Intriguingly, the series of identified crosslinks all localized to a discrete surface groove formed by α-helices that comprise the defined α-helical 2 domain of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (McAndrew et al., 2008) and lie just proximal to the binding sites of the FAD co-factor and the enzymatic substrate itself (Figure 4B).
PMC5916823	R04004	Using the identified crosslinks as constraints for computational docking, the MCL-1 BH3 motif is predicted to engage very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase by a helix-in-groove interaction that is analogous to the interaction paradigm for BH3 helices with BCL-2 family anti-apoptotic pockets (Sattler et al., 1997; Stewart et al., 2010) (Figure 4B).
PMC5916823	R05000	To validate these findings by a distinct methodology, we undertook hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HXMS) analysis of the interaction between recombinant very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and the VLCAD-selective MCL-1 SAHBD V220A construct.
PMC5916823	R05003	Here, we observed protection of peptide fragments encompassing residues 431–489 of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase upon MCL-1 SAHB interaction (Figure 4C–D).
PMC5916823	R06003	The results were strikingly similar, indicating that an acute or chronic absence of MCL-1 leads to elevation of the very substrate precursors of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Figure 5B).
PMC5916823	R07000	With these data having implicated MCL-1Matrix as the candidate MCL-1 isoform for very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase regulation, we sought to confirm an isoform-specific interaction in vivo.
PMC5916823	R07002	In comparison with the FLAG-MCL-1 wild-type pull-down (both forms present) (Figure 1F), we observed selective enrichment for very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase in the FLAG-MCL-1Matrix pull-down, whereas the BH3-only protein targets BIM and PUMA were enriched in the FLAG-MCL-1OMM pull-down (Figure 5G).
PMC5916823	R07003	To rule out the possibility that the interaction between very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and FLAG-MCL-1Matrix was non-specifically enriched due to matrix targeting of the reconstituted protein (despite the compartment-independent re-equilibration of protein interactions that can occur after tissue lysis), we assessed the selectivity of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase interaction in comparison with another CAD of equal abundance, as determined by a compiled proteomics database (Wang et al., 2015), namely LCAD (Figure S5A).
PMC5916823	R07004	We found that, despite their similar abundance, there was a striking 10-fold enrichment of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase in the FLAG-MCL-1Matrix pull-down compared to LCAD, highlighting the selectivity of interaction (Figure S5B).
PMC5916823	R07005	Exemplary mitochondrial proteins of varying abundance with no structural relationship to very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase likewise showed no non-specific enrichment for FLAG-MCL-1Matrix as compared to the GFP control (Figure S5).
PMC5916823	R07006	Taken together, the acylcarnitine and proteomic data point to a specific role for MCL-1Matrix in regulating fatty acid β-oxidation through very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase interaction.
PMC5916823	R08000	Whereas the acylcarnitine data pointed to a role for MCL-1Matrix in regulating fatty acid β-oxidation, the observed elevations could reflect either accumulation from impaired very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity or enhanced mobilization due to increased flux through the pathway.
PMC5916823	R09002	Since loss-of-function mutation of the MCL-1 groove did not alter the mitochondrial phenotype associated with MCL-1Matrix in reconstituted cells (Perciavalle et al., 2012), and the interaction between the hydrophobic face of MCL-1 BH3 and very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Figures 3–4) implies an altered MCL-1 conformation, we hypothesized that S63845 would have no effect on long-chain fatty acid oxidation.
PMC5916823	R10003	Given the challenge of trapping dynamic and context-dependent native-protein interactions by co-immunoprecipitation after cell lysis, we explored the direct interaction between the MCL-1 BH3 helix and recombinant very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase under conditions of increased palmitoyl-CoA concentrations.
PMC5916823	R10004	Streptavidin pull-downs of biotinylated MCL-1 SAHBD upon palmitoyl-CoA titration yielded a striking increase in very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase co-precipitation that directly correlated with palmitoyl-CoA level, as monitored by electrophoresis and Coomassie stain (Figure 6I).
PMC5916823	R11000	In an effort to link the metabolic consequences of eliminating MCL-1Matrix (Figure 6A–F) and the observed substrate-dependent enhancement of MCL-1 SAHBD/VLCAD interaction (Figure 6I) to a direct functional effect on enzymatic activity, we monitored long-chain fatty acid oxidation by recombinant very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase in the presence and absence of MCL-1 SAHBs.
PMC5916823	R11001	In the presence of the most potent very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase interactor, MCL-1 SAHBD D218A
PMC5916823	R11004	Taken together, these data suggest that the MCL-1 BH3 helix can directly modulate the enzymatic activity of very long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, with the observed in vitro suppressive effect consistent with the heightened activity of long-chain fatty acid oxidation observed in MEFs upon selective elimination of the mitochondrial matrix isoform of MCL-1.
PMC5959920	A00000	While proteases are essential in gastrointestinal physiology, accumulating evidence indicates that dysregulated proteolysis plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
PMC5959920	A00001	Nonetheless, the identity of overactive proteases released by human colonic mucosa remains largely unknown.
PMC5959920	A00003	Herein we have used serine protease-targeted activity-based probes (ABPs) coupled with mass spectral analysis to identify active forms of proteases secreted by the colonic mucosa of healthy controls and IBD patients.
PMC5959920	A00004	Profiling of (Pro-Lys)-ABP bound proteases revealed that most of hyperactive proteases from IBD secretome are clustered at 28-kDa.
PMC5959920	A00005	We identified seven active proteases: the serine proteases cathepsin G, plasma kallikrein, plasmin, tryptase, chymotrypsin-like elastase 3 A, and thrombin and the aminopeptidase B. Only cathepsin G and thrombin were overactive in supernatants from IBD patient tissues compared to healthy controls.
PMC5959920	A00006	Gene expression analysis highlighted the transcription of genes encoding these proteases into intestinal mucosae.
PMC5959920	A00007	The functional ABP-targeted proteomic approach that we have used to identify active proteases in human colonic samples bears directly on the understanding of the role these enzymes may play in the pathophysiology of IBD.
PMC5959920	D00001	Using such approaches, only few proteases were identified.
PMC5959920	D00005	Herein, we used a biotinylated ABP capable of interacting with lysine-cleaving proteases (biotin-PK-DPP), a catalytic feature of most serine proteases and some proteases from other classes21.
PMC5959920	D00006	Furthermore, experiments performed with increasing amounts of active trypsin clearly demonstrated that the signal intensity generated by this ABP augmented accordingly, thus highlighting that this probe can unveil varying activity levels of lysine-cleaving proteases.
PMC5959920	D00008	Because streptavidin which is used to reveal biotinylated bands, can bind non-specifically to proteins22,23, and because we cannot fully exclude that ABP might bind non-specifically to some proteins in a complex mixture, the use of inhibitory AEBSF pre-treatment in counterpart samples was instrumental at discriminating active protease bands.
PMC5959920	D01000	In previous work using activity-based probes to identify active serine proteases associated with intestinal inflammation in an infectious model of rodent colitis, we established a role for host serine proteases and their signalling target, protease-activated receptor-2 (PAR2), in driving the inflammatory response14.
PMC5959920	D01003	Our main finding is that compared with non-diseased tissues, serine protease-targeted activity-based probes reveal a distinct set of active serine proteases secreted by colonic tissues derived from individuals with either Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis.
PMC5959920	D02000	Several studies have documented high levels of tryptase in IBD mucosae24–26.
PMC5959920	D02001	However, increased level of tryptase in IBD mucosae was reported based on immunoassays24,26.
PMC5959920	D02002	Active tryptase was not detected in the secretome from UC biopsies in this study.
PMC5959920	D02003	Our results suggest that concomitantly with exocytosis of tryptase, endogenous inhibitors could also be present in the granules or in the vicinity of activated mast cells, leading to a quick neutralization of enzymatic activity.
PMC5959920	D02004	While from protein or mRNA expression studies, tryptase could appear as a potential molecular target for IBD, our results suggest on the contrary that active tryptase is not present in patient’s tissues.
PMC5959920	D04000	The expression of all serine proteases identified by ABP labelling, namely thrombin, cathepsin G, plasma kallikrein, plasmin, tryptase and chymotrypsin-like elastase family member 3 A, were also found as mRNA transcripts in extracts of colon biopsy tissue (Table 1 and Fig.
PMC5959920	D06000	Surprisingly, one protease from a class other than serine protease was identified as active in samples from UC patients: the metallopeptidase aminopeptidase B.
PMC5959920	D06001	This enzyme is known to display endopeptidase activity after an Arg or a Lys residue28 and this could explain the fact that it binds to the ABP we have used here.
PMC5959920	D06002	To the best of our knowledge, the role of aminopeptidase B in IBD pathophysiology has not been evaluated yet.
PMC5959920	D07000	In summary, the functional proteomic approach employed herein allowed for the identification of a consistent proteomic profile of active serine proteases secreted by the colonic mucosa of healthy and IBD patients.
PMC5959920	D07001	Additionally, the use of ABP labelling in conjunction with mass spectral proteomic analysis resulted in the identification of unique active proteases selectively secreted from the colitis-derived samples, compared with samples from disease-free individuals.
PMC5959920	D07002	This approach identified not only proteases previously established as putative candidates in IBD pathophysiology, but also enzymes not yet appreciated in this context.
PMC5959920	D07003	In this way, the results presented herein pave the way for future studies aimed at understanding the roles of these proteases in IBD pathophysiology.
PMC5959920	D07004	This study also revealed strong differences between CD patients and UC in terms of profiles of active proteases that could dictate distinct and specific therapies for these 2 sub-categories of IBD patients in the forthcoming targeted therapy strategies.
PMC5959920	D07005	The approach proposed here can be applied to other diseases and other tissues, in order to identify active secreted proteases that may play roles in other inflammatory diseases, so as to serve as potential new therapeutic targets.

PMC5959920	I01000	Proteases are essential mediators in gastrointestinal physiology, being produced and released by the pancreas, in order to be activated in the intestinal lumen for digestive purposes.
PMC5959920	I02000	The identity of overactive serine proteases in intestinal tissues remains elusive.
PMC5959920	I02002	This is an interesting finding, given that most studies aimed at identifying upregulated proteases in inflammatory diseases have focused on enzymes highly expressed by infiltrating immune cells.
PMC5959920	I02003	Thus, gene and protein expressions of several proteases released primarily by leukocytes (including neutrophil elastase, proteinase-3, cathepsin G, tryptase, chymase or granzymes) have been found to be upregulated in IBD2.
PMC5959920	I02004	Additionally, genetic studies have supported an association of protease genes with IBD risk7,8.
PMC5959920	I02005	Nevertheless, the major limitations of such studies based on expression analysis are due to the fact that mRNA or protein levels for proteases do not necessarily reflect their activity status.
PMC5959920	I03000	Therefore, the identity and implication of proteases in health and diseases, including IBD, have to come from studies investigating the in situ net activity of these enzymes9.
PMC5959920	I04000	The ABP structure possesses a reactive group that mimics enzymatic substrate and covalently binds to active proteases.
PMC5959920	I04003	Obviously, detection of active proteases is dependent on their affinity towards the ABP that is used.
PMC5959920	I04004	We have previously used this approach successfully to identify active serine proteases upregulated in the setting of a murine model of infectious colitis14 and to determine the sequences of serine proteases present in complex allergenic cockroach extracts15.
PMC5959920	I04005	Here, we performed a study to profile and identify active serine proteases secreted by the colonic mucosa of control and IBD patients by using ABPs.
PMC5959920	M04006	The bands corresponding to active proteases were identified by their sensitivity to AEBSF.
PMC5959920	M05004	The pellets containing the ABP-protease complexes adsorbed to the magnetic beads were washed twice with 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (Sigma-Aldrich, USA), and then suspended in 6 M urea and 25 mM DTT (Sigma-Aldrich).
PMC5959920	M08003	A potential active protease was selected based on an enrichment ratio >2 (Intensity AEBSF not treated vs. treated) and a Student’s t-test P-value < 0.05 over the triplicates.
PMC5959920	M09003	Resulting cDNA samples were amplified by conventional PCR with Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, USA) and sequence-specific primer pairs (Supplementary Table 1).
PMC5959920	R01001	To characterize the serine proteases underlying this increase of proteolytic activity, we initially performed ABP proteomic profiling assays with these samples.
PMC5959920	R01002	Since ABPs react only with active enzymes, the bands corresponding to proteases were discriminated from non-specific labelling by pre-incubating the samples in parallel with the serine protease inhibitor, AEBSF.
PMC5959920	R01004	As a whole, bands representing putative serine proteases ranged from 12 to 250 kDa (Fig. 3A).
PMC5959920	R01005	A distribution analysis of putative proteases according to their molecular weight regrouped them in 10 main clusters, with mean molecular weights of 15, 24, 28, 32, 36, 68, 100, 126, 140 and 250 kDa.
PMC5959920	R01006	The majority of serine proteases were grouped into the 28, 32 and 36 kDa clusters (Fig.
PMC5959920	R04000	Unbiased mass spectrometric analysis identified 6 proteases from S1 family in samples from colonic biopsy supernatants.
PMC5959920	R04001	These proteases were considered active according to the ability of AEBSF to block labelling, with an activity index >2 and P < 0.05 (Table 1).
PMC5959920	R04003	This group of identified active proteases includes thrombin, cathepsin G, kallikrein-1 (also named plasma kallikrein), plasmin, chymotrypsin-like elastase family member 3A and tryptase.
PMC5959920	R04004	Additionally, aminopeptidase B (also called arginyl aminopeptidase), a lysine-cleaving protease from the M01 family was also identified as active.
PMC5959920	R04006	Similarly, aminopeptidase B was highly active specifically in association with UC (Table 1).
PMC5959920	R05000	Gene expression experiments were carried out to investigate whether or not the proteases identified as active were expressed in the human colonic mucosa.
PMC5959920	R05001	RT-PCR products were detected for the 7 proteases, wherein amplicons with expected base pair numbers were amplified from colonic mucosa (Fig. ​(Fig.44).
PMC5983154	A03000	We observed a correlation between the synthetic rates of skeletal muscle‐derived proteins obtained in serum (creatine kinase M‐type, carbonic anhydrase 3) and the synthetic rates of proteins obtained via muscle sampling; and that the synthesis rates of these proteins in serum revealed the stimulatory effects of RT.
PMC5983154	A05006	The synthetic rates of 175 of 190 contractile, cytosolic and mitochondrial skeletal muscle proteins, as well as synthesis of muscle‐derived proteins measured in serum, creatine kinase M‐type (CK‐M) and carbonic anhydrase 3 (CA‐3), were higher during ER + RT than during ER (P < 0.05).
PMC5983154	I01008	We have recently extended this approach to measure the synthetic rate of skeletal muscle‐synthesized proteins that escape into circulation such as creatine kinase M‐type (CK‐M) and carbonic anhydrase (CA‐3) (Shankaran et al. 2016a).
PMC6002243	D03005	Tubulins mainly play their physiological roles in cellular structure maintenance, GTPase activity and intracellular movement as components of cytoskeleton [21].
PMC6002243	R00003	These potential autoantigens could be divided into different groups below, based on their function: immune response (V3-4 protein, anti-streptococcal/anti-myosin immunoglobulin lambda light chain variable region, lysozyme C); cell mobility, structure, or cell integrity (Cingulin, BAG family molecular chaperone regulator 3 (BAG3), tubulin alpha-1C); lipid transportation (isoform 2 of cholesteryl ester transfer protein, apolipoprotein L1 isoform c precursor),regulation of transcription (zinc finger protein 669, α-enolase); extracellular matrix integrity (Isoform E of Proteoglycan 4), intracellular signal transduction (Serine/threonine-protein kinase TAO3 (TAOK3), retinal guanylyl cyclase 1) and the coagulation cascade (Vitamin K-dependent protein S, protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor, Kininogen-1).
PMC6002243	R00005	Among these proteins, α-enolase has been previously proved to be an autoantigen of BD [8], and autoantibodies againstα-enolase were identified as components of anti-endothelial cell antibody (AECA).
PMC6002243	R00006	Since AECA was a diagnostic biomarker commonly applied for BD and other vasculitis [8], the identification ofα-enolase supported the feasibility of proteomic screening on CICs for BD diagnostic biomarkers in our study.

PMC6046383	A00003	Here, using a reductionistic approach, we explored the effects of two proteases active during injury and wounding, human thrombin and plasmin, on the NETome.
PMC6046383	A00005	The serine proteases, particularly thrombin, were also found to interact with DNA and bound to NETs in vitro.
PMC6046383	A00006	Among the most abundant proteins were those identified previously, including histones, neutrophil elastase, and antimicrobial proteins.
PMC6046383	A00007	We observed reduced histone (H2B, H3, and H4) and neutrophil elastase levels upon the addition of the two proteases.
PMC6046383	A00008	Analyses of NET-derived tryptic peptides identified subtle changes upon protease treatments.
PMC6046383	A00009	Our results provide evidence that exogenous proteases, present during wounding and inflammation, influence the NETome.
PMC6046383	D00000	Here, we report for the first time that exogenous proteases such as thrombin and plasmin can alter the proteome of NETs.
PMC6046383	D01000	Studies on the proteome of NETs have used nucleases at varying concentrations (5–20 U/ml) and incubation durations (10–40 min) (6, 7, 20, 21).
PMC6046383	D01007	(6) only, such as histone H1 and catalase, respectively (Table ​(Table1).1).
PMC6046383	D02007	In this respect, it is interesting to note that thrombin and plasmin, like ELANE, belongs to the vast family of S1 peptidases, sharing an overall similar structure and folding (35).
PMC6046383	D03005	On a separate note, it was also interesting that the H4 peptide (V61→K78) was missing in the thrombin- and plasmin-treated NETs, which may indicate that the proteases targeted this region (Figure ​(Figure55C).
PMC6046383	D04001	Therefore, to focus on the concept that proteases may influence the proteome of pre-formed NETs, we selected PMA as the standard NET-inducing agent.
PMC6046383	D05006	Therefore, these evidences imply that exogenous proteases, such as thrombin or plasmin, can modulate NET effects in various physiological contexts.
PMC6046383	D06000	Interestingly, NET-associated ELANE was also reduced in the presence of thrombin and plasmin, and several tryptic peptides, present in the untreated samples, were not detected after subjection to the two proteases (Figure ​(Figure6;6; Table S1 in Supplementary Material).

PMC6046383	I02002	With this as background, we hypothesized that these two serine proteases may alter the proteome of NETs.
PMC6046383	R00002	The experiments were performed in the absence of serum to exclude potential influences from other serum proteases.
PMC6046383	R03000	The two S1 peptidases thrombin and plasmin have been reported to interact with DNA aptamers (17) and short oligos (18).
PMC6046383	R03003	Moreover, the presence of the two proteases was further validated by western blotting, where antibodies specific for thrombin (~37 kDa) and plasmin (~40 kDa), detected these proteins in the respective NET samples under reducing conditions (Figure ​(Figure3C).3C).
PMC6046383	R03004	To investigate whether the two proteases interact with DNA, thrombin and plasmin were incubated with purified PMN DNA and analyzed by a gel mobility shift assay.
PMC6046383	R05000	As thrombin and plasmin are proteases, we explored whether their proteolytic activities resulted in the observed reduction of histone levels.
PMC6046383	R05002	We observed that the three types of histones were indeed degraded in the presence of the two proteases (Figure ​(Figure4F),4F), which was in agreement with the immunoblot results (Figure ​(Figure4E).4E).
PMC6046383	R07001	Correspondingly, western blot analysis using polyclonal antibodies against ELANE showed that it was reduced on NETs following treatments with the proteases (Figure ​(Figure6B).6B).
PMC6046383	R07004	These results may explain the observation that ELANE staining was significantly reduced by the two proteases as detected by western blotting (Figure ​(Figure66B).

PMC6379952	A00000	A promising arsenal of histone deacetylase (HDAC)-targeted treatment has emerged in the past decade, as the abnormal targeting or retention of HDACs to DNA regulatory regions often occurs in many cancers.
PMC6379952	A00002	histone deacetylase inhibitors have great potential to treat this devastating disease; however, few has been studied regarding the beneficial role of histone deacetylase inhibition in anti-HNSCC therapy and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive.

PMC6379952	A03000	Our insights explore the critical role of EGFR-Arf1 complex in driving HNSCC progression, and demonstrate the selective action of histone deacetylase inhibitors on this specific axis for suppressing HNSCC invasion.
PMC6379952	D00001	histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as TSA, exhibit their anticancer activity by promoting the acetylation of histones, leading to uncoiling of chromatin and activation of a variety of genes involved in the regulation of oncogenesis.
PMC6379952	D00002	However, the therapeutic effects of histone deacetylase inhibitors on cancer invasion and metastasis and the underlying action mechanisms are rarely reported.
PMC6379952	D00004	These promising findings aide in understanding the complex set of molecular events in HNSCC cells in response to histone deacetylase inhibitors.
PMC6379952	D00005	As there is an increasing interest in using histone deacetylase inhibitors to treat various cancers in the clinic, the knowledge gained from this study would be significantly beneficial for the development of new rational HDAC-targeted anticancer modalities.
PMC6379952	D01008	Our work expands the observation that histone deacetylase inhibitors could serve as a single agent to block EGFR, which may or may not directly rely on the activity of HDACs in HNSCC cells.
PMC6379952	D02000	Arf1 is one of Arf family GTPases and acts as a crucial regulator for vesicular vesicle trafficking.
PMC6379952	D02005	Most importantly, histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as TSA, can induce the proteasome degradation of EGFR, which in turn inactivating Arf1, leading to suppression of tumor-promoting activity.
PMC6379952	D03001	The treatment of histone deacetylase inhibitors has been observed to augment cell migration and metastasis in human breast, gastric, liver, and lung cancer, which significantly ruins their therapeutic efficacy [40].
PMC6379952	D03002	However, this effect mediated by histone deacetylase inhibitors are cancer-type dependent as our observations clearly delineate that histone deacetylase inhibitors can inhibit both proliferation and invasion in HNSCC cells.

PMC6379952	I01000	Histone deacetylase inhibitors, the compounds that interfere with the function of histone deacetylase and lead to accumulation of acetylated nuclear histones, are potent anticancer agents with moderately little effect on normal tissues [7, 8].
PMC6379952	I01002	The diverse functions of histone deacetylase inhibitors in mediating anticancer activities at different cellular levels, including histone acetylation-independent regulation, have been reported, although the causative mechanism remains undefined [9].
PMC6379952	I01003	As histone deacetylase inhibitors are well tolerated by cancer patients with manageable side effects, many of them, including those with broad-spectrum non-selective activity, are under preclinical and clinical evaluation.
PMC6379952	I01004	Although some histone deacetylase inhibitors are successful in treating hematologic malignancies, their use in solid tumors remains controversial [9, 10].
PMC6379952	I01005	A better comprehension of HDACs in cancer will give us a mechanistic-based rationale for the clinical use of histone deacetylase inhibitors as anticancer agents [11].
PMC6379952	I02003	These findings suggest that use of histone deacetylase inhibitors can represent a novel strategy for anti-HNSCC.
PMC6379952	I03000	Here, we use TSA and PXD101 to demonstrate that histone deacetylase inhibitors have the potential to induce repression of HNSCC aggressiveness and to inactivate ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1), a small GTPase involved in regulation of membrane trafficking pathways [15–17].
PMC6379952	I03001	Further studies revealed the activity of Arf1 was much higher in metastatic HNSCC cells than cells derived from the primary sites, and histone deacetylase inhibitors induced protein degradation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which consequently suppressed Arf1 activation in HNSCC cells.
PMC6379952	I03002	Our novel findings provide precise mechanistic insights into action of histone deacetylase inhibitors by exploring the previously unrecognized function in interrupting the EGFR-Arf1 complex in HNSCC progression, which provide the rationale for further clinical applications of this strategy in patients with HNSCC.
PMC6379952	M02000	histone deacetylase activity was measured with the fluorometric histone deacetylase Activity Assay kit (Abcam, Cambridge, MA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

PMC6379952	R00000	Given that histones in mammalian cells treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors are acetylated to an unusually high extent, we sought to determine the changes in histone acetylation levels in HNSCC cells in the presence or absence of TSA.
PMC6379952	R00001	Western blotting analysis revealed that TSA at 5 μM induced pronounced histone H3 and H4 hyperacetylation (Fig. 1a), and suppressed histone deacetylase activity (Fig. ​(Fig.1b)1b) in both HN12 and HN31 cells.
PMC6379952	R00003	PXD101, another potent histone deacetylase inhibitor, was also used in this study, which showed the similar effects observed from TSA treatment (Fig. ​(Fig.11a-​a-1f).1f).
PMC6389127	A00002	Prior work established a sufficient role for glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in enhancing human BNB biophysical properties following serum withdrawal in vitro via RET-tyrosine kinase-dependent cytoskeletal remodeling.
PMC6389127	A00004	Proteomic studies suggested expression of several mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) in confluent GDNF-treated endoneurial endothelial cells following serum withdrawal.
PMC6389127	A00005	Using electric cell-substrate impedance sensing to continuously measure transendothelial electrical resistance and static transwell solute permeability assays with fluoresceinated small and large molecules to evaluate BNB biophysical function, we determined mitogen activated protein kinase signaling was essential for GDNF-mediated BNB TEER increase following serum withdrawal downstream of RET-tyrosine kinase signaling that persisted for up to 48 hours in vitro.
PMC6389127	D00000	Using well-established assays of endothelial barrier function, this study demonstrates the role of intracellular mitogen activated protein kinase signaling in GDNF-mediated enhancement of human BNB function following serum withdrawal in vitro, and also confirms that GDNF signals through RET-tyrosine kinase during this process.
PMC6389127	D03000	Endothelial cells are serum-dependent for attachment, and serum withdrawal is associated with diffuse reduction in continuous intercellular membrane contacts in sub-confluent proliferating cells.46 However, serum withdrawal is also a well-established technique to suppress growth, induce contact-inhibition and promote intercellular junction formation by confluent epithelial and endothelial cells in vitro.50-52 The effect of GDNF, RET-tyrosine kinase and mitogen activated protein kinase signaling in maintaining a high TEER following serum withdrawal was confirmed at the human BNB in vitro.
PMC6389127	D04002	There is also evidence that GDNF (secreted by enteric glial cells) regulates the intestinal epithelial barrier in vitro and in vivo, with a potential role in barrier maturation (via p38 mitogen activated protein kinase pathway), wound healing (via cyclic AMP/protein kinase A pathway) and in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease.25-28
PMC6389127	D08001	Direct enhancement of intracellular mitogen activated protein kinase signaling for therapeutic purposes may prove difficult due to the ubiquitous use of this pathway in multiple cellular processes, including cell survival.
PMC6389127	D08002	Identifying and studying specific proteins such as TLN1 and CTNNA1, and the signaling pathways downstream of mitogen activated protein kinase signaling associated with transcription control of essential cytoskeletal and junctional complex genes, mechanisms of cytoskeletal remodeling and protein translocation from the cytosol to intercellular membranes, regulation of cell polarity and intercellular junction complex formation may provide targets for future therapeutic modulation to restore physiological BNB function in adult human peripheral nerves in different disease states.

PMC6389127	I01000	GDNF, a related member of the transforming growth factor β protein superfamily, supports the survival of peripheral autonomic and sensory, spinal cord motor and midbrain dopaminergic neurons.8-12 GDNF typically signals via its glycosylphosphatidyl inositol-anchored protein receptor, GFRα1, complexed with “rearranged during transfection” (RET)-tyrosine kinase as part of a multicomponent receptor complex, and utilizes intracellular Ras-mitogen activated protein kinase (mitogen activated protein kinase), phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/AKT, p38 mitogen activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathways for its biological effects.11,13-17 Primary human endoneurial endothelial cells (pHEndECs) that form the BNB express GFRα1 in vitro and in situ.7,18-20 Our prior work demonstrated that GDNF is a sufficient paracrine human BNB regulator following serum withdrawal in vitro.19
PMC6389127	I02000	GDNF (in a dose-dependent manner) induced restrictive human BNB properties dependent on RET-tyrosine kinase signaling pathways via histologically-observed cytoskeletal reorganization (i.e. translocation of F-actin cytoskeletal filaments from the cytoplasm to cell membranes) that resulted in more continuous intercellular contacts.
PMC6389127	I02001	This occurred without significantly upregulating known adaptor, adherens and tight junction-associated protein expression, or modulating claudin-5 phosphorylation in vitro, and was independent of cyclic AMP/protein kinase A signaling.19 That study also suggested a role for hyperactivated mitogen activated protein kinase signaling in GDNF-mediated human BNB recovery when combined with other less efficacious mitogens (in an attempt to mimic in vivo conditions), with published preliminary data further supporting a direct role of mitogen activated protein kinase signaling in GDNF-mediated restoration of human BNB electrical resistance.21
PMC6389127	I03001	In order to ascertain the signaling pathways by which GDNF enhances human BNB function in vitro following serum withdrawal downstream of RET-tyrosine kinase, we performed electric cell-substrate impedance sensing (ECIS) to continuously monitor impedance, TEER and capacitance,29 and transwell solute permeability assays to fluoresceinated low and high molecular weight molecules using specific cell permeable signaling pathway inhibitors, guided by proteomic data derived from GDNF-treated pHEndECs following serum withdrawal in vitro, with appropriate controls.
PMC6389127	I03002	To more comprehensively ascertain potential molecular determinants of the intercellular junctional complex responsible for the previously ascertained GDNF-mediated effect on the restrictive human in vitro BNB, we performed human adherens junction and tight junction quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) arrays, quantitative proteomics of cytosolic and membrane protein extracts and fluorescent indirect immunocytochemistry on confluent pHEndEC cultures 48 hours following serum withdrawal with and without added GDNF.
PMC6389127	R01001	These data imply that downstream mitogen activated protein kinase signaling may be relevant to the observed and previously published GDNF-mediated pHEndEC cytoskeletal modifications and human BNB TEER enhancement following serum withdrawal in vitro that was dependent on RET-tyrosine kinase signaling.19 Cytoskeletal and junctional complex proteins implicated in specialized intercellular junction formation were also identified.
PMC6389127	R02003	Inhibitors against MEK1 and ERK1/2 completely inhibited the GDNF-mediated TEER increase down to basal levels by 48 hours following serum withdrawal while the RET-Tyrosine kinase inhibitor reduced the maximal TEER to basal levels with a lower decline compared to basal, MEK 1-inhibited and ERK1/2-inhibited conditions (Figure 3).
PMC6389127	R03001	RET-tyrosine kinase inhibition resulted in a statistically significant higher mean TEER increase and persistence compared to basal, MEK1 and ERK1/2-inhibited conditions, suggesting that GDNF may partially signal via non-RET-tyrosine kinase signaling pathways and utilize downstream MAPK-dependent intracellular signaling pathways to maintain elevated TEER following serum withdrawal in vitro.
PMC6389127	R04000	Overall, these data support the hypothesis that GDNF enhances human BNB TEER following initial confluent pHEndEC culture and serum withdrawal, dependent on RET-tyrosine kinase/MAPK signaling pathways in vitro without significant change in endothelial cell proliferation, using capacitance as a surrogate marker.
PMC6389127	R05002	This effect was abolished by specific cell-permeable inhibitors against RET-tyrosine kinase, MEK1 and ERK1/2, with no significant differences observed between these inhibitors and basal conditions.
PMC6389127	R05004	The mean Na-FITC permeabilities following serum withdrawal with concurrent treatment with GDNF and specific inhibitors of RET-tyrosine kinase, MEK1 and ERK1/2 were 11.25 (± 3.22)%, 9.57 (± 2.97)% and 11.70 (± 3.60)% respectively and were not different from basal conditions.
PMC6389127	R05006	The mean dextran-70-FITC permeabilities following serum withdrawal and concurrent treatment with GDNF and specific inhibitors of RET-tyrosine kinase, MEK1 and ERK1/2 were 2.95 (± 1.18)%, 2.54 (± 1.20)% and 2.54 (± 1.06)% respectively, and were not different from basal conditions based on normalized values under basal conditions without exogenous GDNF treatment.
PMC6389127	R06001	This is consistent with previously published initial observations of GDNF-mediated reduction in dextran-70-FITC permeability following serum withdrawal, as well as the observed more continuous intercellular contacts and fewer intercellular gaps (that may provide a route for paracellular transport or diffusion) between adjacent pHEndECs mediated by GDNF and RET tyrosine kinase following serum withdrawal in vitro.19
PMC6389127	R11001	Decreased expression of the following top 5 gene transcripts was also observed: PARD6B (cell polarity regulator; 907.0-fold), PRKCZ (serine/threonine kinase cell function regulator; 404.5-fold), CLDN8, CLDN4 (tight junction proteins; 188.7-fold and 155.4-fold respectively), and SPTA1 (cytoskeletal component; 88.0-fold), as shown in Figure 8.
PMC6389127	R12002	Changes in several regulators of cellular function such as regulation of cell polarity (increased PARD6A, MARK2, SMURF1, MPP5, MPDZ and PARD3; decreased PARD6B), specific serine/threonine kinases (increased CDK4, decreased PRKCZ), cell adhesion molecules/attachment regulators (increased ICAM2, ILK, ICAM1) were also observed following GDNF-mediated enhancement of human BNB restrictive biophysical properties following serum withdrawal in vitro.

PMC6430080	A00001	Thiol-proteins from protein disulfide isomerase (protein disulfide isomerase) family are unexplored in this context.
PMC6430080	A00002	Here, we investigate the occurrence and physiological significance of a circulating pool of protein disulfide isomerase in healthy humans.
PMC6430080	A00003	We validated an assay for detecting protein disulfide isomerase in plasma of healthy individuals.
PMC6430080	A00005	Remarkably, plasma protein disulfide isomerase levels could discriminate between distinct plasma proteome signatures, with PDI-rich (>median) plasma differentially expressing proteins related to cell differentiation, protein processing, housekeeping functions and others, while PDI-poor plasma differentially displayed proteins associated with coagulation, inflammatory responses and immunoactivation.
PMC6430080	A00009	Patients with cardiovascular events had lower protein disulfide isomerase levels vs. healthy individuals.
PMC6430080	A00010	This is the first study describing protein disulfide isomerase levels as reporters of specific plasma proteome signatures directly promoting contrasting endothelial phenotypes and functional responses.
PMC6430080	D00000	Our results indicate that plasma protein disulfide isomerase is detectable in healthy individuals, depicting high inter-individual but low intra-individual variability.
PMC6430080	D00001	Remarkably, protein disulfide isomerase levels behave as reporters of distinct plasma protein signatures, with PDI-rich plasma differentially expressing proteins related to cell differentiation, protein processing and housekeeping functions, among others, while PDI-poor plasma differentially displays a subset of proteins associated with coagulation, inflammatory responses and immunoactivation.
PMC6430080	D00002	Moreover, there is close correlation of protein disulfide isomerase levels and corresponding protein signatures with EC function and phenotype, since cultured EC incubated with PDI-poor or PDI-rich plasmas recapitulated gene expression and secretome profiles in line with the observed plasma proteome.
PMC6430080	D00005	[28] also showed a detectable plasma protein disulfide isomerase pool in healthy donors measured by noncommercial ELISA, however at a 250–1000 ng/mL range (∼4–17 nM), significantly higher than in our assays.
PMC6430080	D00007	Also, protein disulfide isomerase and ERp57 were previously reported in plasma proteome but not clearly associated with cardiovascular risk [54].
PMC6430080	D00008	While this is to our knowledge the first report assessing plasma concentrations of a protein disulfide isomerase family protein, it is not unlikely that other PDIs can also potentially be present in plasma and display analogous behaviors.
PMC6430080	D01000	While our results indicate that plasma protein disulfide isomerase pool is mainly reduced (Fig. 2D), correlations between protein disulfide isomerase redox state and activity deserve further discussion.
PMC6430080	D01001	Oxidized protein disulfide isomerase can directly introduce disulfides into its substrates, with reduced protein disulfide isomerase as end-product; in the ER PDI is reoxidized by Ero1, GSSG and oxidized Prx4 or Gpx7/8 [3].
PMC6430080	D01002	Reduced protein disulfide isomerase can either reduce substrate thiols (with oxidized protein disulfide isomerase as end-product) or promote thiol reshuffling of disulfide bonds, yielding reduced PDI [7,55].
PMC6430080	D01003	Interestingly, kinetic trapping experiments suggest that different substrates are biased to reduction vs. oxidation by protein disulfide isomerase.
PMC6430080	D01006	In parallel, although protein disulfide isomerase does not seem a mass peroxide sensor as discussed before, it is affected by redox potentials [7].
PMC6430080	D01007	Accordingly, one might expect that plasma protein disulfide isomerase would be primarily oxidized [56], contrary to our results, since redox potential of the major plasma thiol pools, CyS/CySS (−80 ± 9 mV) and GSH/GSSG (−137 ± 9 mV)
PMC6430080	D01008	[1] are more oxidizing than protein disulfide isomerase redox potential (−190 ± 10 mV).
PMC6430080	D02000	Several mechanisms may regulate plasma protein disulfide isomerase levels and account for their variability.
PMC6430080	D03001	In both cases, such effects are likely related to corresponding plasma protein signatures rather than to protein disulfide isomerase levels themselves.
PMC6430080	D03002	This is because the pM/nM protein disulfide isomerase concentration ranges contrast with higher concentrations of its many plasma substrates (e.g., HRG, 100–150 μg/mL)
PMC6430080	D03004	Thus, it is likely that protein disulfide isomerase levels behave as a reporter of the amount and type of bound substrates.
PMC6430080	D04000	protein disulfide isomerase adds to other thiol-proteins with potential as disease biomarkers such as glutathione peroxidase-3, quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase, thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase, glutaredoxin
PMC6430080	D04001	[1] and S-nitrosoglutathione reductase [62].
PMC6430080	D04004	A clear limitation of our results is that the type of population and the small number of subjects does not allow inferences about biomarker capabilities of protein disulfide isomerase levels.
PMC6430080	D04005	Nevertheless, to get a potential insight into this question, we evaluated protein disulfide isomerase levels from plasma samples (n = 95) collected in a previously well-described and validated databank from a population composed of individuals with clinically evident vascular disease [64].
PMC6430080	D04006	Patients who had documented cardiovascular events, namely myocardial infarction, unstable angina and cerebrovascular accident (further detailed at Table 2) showed significantly lower median circulating protein disulfide isomerase levels vs. healthy individuals (Fig. 7D), indicating that lower protein disulfide isomerase levels may have a general correlation with enhanced cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic atherosclerotic disease.
PMC6430080	D04007	Again, protein disulfide isomerase levels were unrelated to other traditional risk factors (gender, LDL-cholesterol levels, HDL-cholesterol levels, triglycerides, diabetes, body mass index – Suppl.

Improvement in outcomes after cardiac arrest and resuscitation by inhibition of s-nitrosoglutathione reductase.
PMC6430080	I00002	In this context, thiol proteins from the protein disulfide isomerase (protein disulfide isomerase) family remain unexplored [2].
PMC6430080	I00003	The family prototype is PDIA1 (henceforth designated as PDI), a 55 kDa thiol oxidoreductase chaperone mainly from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), which depicts a U-shaped structure comprising 4 thioredoxin tandem domains termed a-b-b'-a', plus a C-terminal domain.
PMC6430080	I00004	The a-type domains at each arm of the “U” contain catalytic active sites carrying Cys-Gly-His-Cys motifs, which enable protein disulfide isomerase to undergo reduction-oxidation cycles [3,4].
PMC6430080	I00006	protein disulfide isomerase also displays chaperone activity, per se thiol redox-independent, although enhanced upon oxidation [3,5].
PMC6430080	I00007	Canonical protein disulfide isomerase functions consist of introduction or isomerization of disulfide bonds in nascent ER proteins, as well as their retrograde cytoplasmic transport during ER-associated protein degradation [3].
PMC6430080	I00008	Despite being primarily an ER protein, protein disulfide isomerase has been reported at other intracellular locations and also at the cell surface and extracellular milieu (a pool we have termed peri/epicellular protein disulfide isomerase = pecPDI)
PMC6430080	I01001	protein disulfide isomerase inhibition strongly inhibits both platelet accumulation and fibrin generation at the injury site [8].
PMC6430080	I01002	The a′ rather than a-domain protein disulfide isomerase cysteines are specifically involved in thrombosis and platelet activation [9].
PMC6430080	I01003	In EC, pecPDI is estimated as <2% of cellular protein disulfide isomerase and its externalization occurs without detectable plasma membrane damage via yet unclear secretion routes that are mostly Golgi-independent [10].
PMC6430080	I01004	However, protein disulfide isomerase extravasation substantially increases upon cell injury, given the very high intracellular expression of PDIs in general [10].
PMC6430080	I01005	In EC, protein disulfide isomerase is detectable in vesicles distinct from those containing Von Willebrand factor
PMC6430080	I01006	[[8], [11], [12]], while impairment of lysosome and dense granule biogenesis inhibits EC or platelet protein disulfide isomerase secretion and enhances bleeding
PMC6430080	I01008	In platelets, protein disulfide isomerase is located at the dense tubular system and likely exocytosed upon activation [13].
PMC6430080	I01009	The roles of PDIs in thrombosis are at the forefront of translational advances in novel antithrombotic agents [8], with the list of new protein disulfide isomerase inhibitors growing quite fast recently [[14], [15], [16]].
PMC6430080	I01010	A multi-center efficacy clinical trial of isoquercetin as protein disulfide isomerase inhibitor against cancer-associated thrombosis is currently under way [17].
PMC6430080	I02000	Thrombosis-related extracellular protein disulfide isomerase substrates have been actively investigated and include several integrins, which were well documented in platelets, EC and vessel wall [18].
PMC6430080	I02001	The main effect of protein disulfide isomerase (as well as ERp57 and ERp72) is to reduce integrin disulfide bonds to support transition from extended-moderate to extended-high affinity conformation
PMC6430080	I02003	While protein disulfide isomerase has no membrane-binding or transmembrane motifs, binding to integrins (e.g., β3) accounts for extracellular protein disulfide isomerase retention [21].
PMC6430080	I02004	In addition to integrins, kinetic trapping studies identified multiple protein disulfide isomerase substrates in stimulated platelet-rich plasma, including vitronectin, complement factors 3 and 5, C4b-binding protein, histidine-rich glycoprotein (HRG), thrombospondin 1, coagulation factor V, serpin B6, glutaredoxin-1 [[22], [23], [24]].
PMC6430080	I02005	Importantly, peculiar redox properties of protein disulfide isomerase likely modulate the mode of PDI-substrate interaction.
PMC6430080	I02006	The slow reaction rate with hydrogen peroxide [25] indicates that protein disulfide isomerase is unlikely to act as a mass redox sensor such as peroxiredoxins [7].
PMC6430080	I02007	Also, the low redox potential of N-terminal protein disulfide isomerase domain Cys may support protein disulfide isomerase oxidative capacity over a larger range of ambient reducing potentials than, e.g., thioredoxin
PMC6430080	I02009	Moreover, protein disulfide isomerase supports protein complex organization, such as for NADPH oxidases [27].
PMC6430080	I02011	First, protein disulfide isomerase likely promotes targeted rather than nonspecific redox modulation of its substrates [7].
PMC6430080	I02012	Second, in the extracellular environment, in which protein disulfide isomerase concentration is lower than that of its substrates - contrarily to the ER lumen - the amount of free protein disulfide isomerase can be affected by type and binding capacity of substrates.
PMC6430080	I02013	Thus, protein disulfide isomerase levels could potentially act as reporter of distinct proteome signatures in extracellular compartments such as plasma.
PMC6430080	I03000	However, there is little information on circulating plasma levels of vascular thiol isomerases.
PMC6430080	I03001	One study reported a low-level pool of protein disulfide isomerase in plasma from healthy humans [28] and some reports showed protein disulfide isomerase release from platelets [29,30] or associated with EC and platelet microparticles
PMC6430080	I03003	In contrast, it has been recently suggested that extracellular protein disulfide isomerase and other thiol isomerases are absent from the circulation as a way to suppress thrombus formation [22], while upon vascular wall injury protein disulfide isomerase release from disrupted endothelium and bound platelets relieves such suppression and promotes thrombosis via disulfide modification of covalently-bound substrates.
PMC6430080	I03004	Here, we addressed the occurrence and physiological significance of a circulating pool of protein disulfide isomerase in healthy humans, with a focus on its role as reporter of distinct plasma protein signatures involved in endothelial phenotype and functional responses potentially associated with disease risk.
PMC6430080	R00000	Circulating plasma protein disulfide isomerase levels were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
PMC6430080	R01000	The amount of protein disulfide isomerase detected by our assay was low, at pM levels, and their distribution was not normal, as confirmed by specific tests (Fig.
PMC6430080	R01002	Microparticle-associated protein disulfide isomerase accounted for a minor fraction of total protein disulfide isomerase levels in our population (Suppl.
PMC6430080	R02000	protein disulfide isomerase exhibits a pool of distinct redox states: fully/partially reduced, fully/partially oxidized to intramolecular disulfides, oxidized to intermolecular disulfides (e.g., S-glutathionylated) or S-nitrosylated.
PMC6430080	R03000	Given the low intra-individual variability despite widely distinct inter-individual plasma levels, we hypothesized that protein disulfide isomerase concentrations could behave as a window to reveal individual plasma protein signatures.
PMC6430080	R04000	We next interrogated whether the observed differences in protein disulfide isomerase plasma levels associate with different platelet function profiles.
PMC6430080	R04004	Since protein disulfide isomerase is secreted after platelet activation, we next investigated soluble protein disulfide isomerase levels after platelet aggregation.
PMC6430080	R04005	Interestingly, protein disulfide isomerase levels in platelet-poor plasma were decreased post-aggregation in most samples regardless of the agonist, with few exceptions (Fig. 4E).
PMC6430080	R04006	Both effects were unrelated to circulating protein disulfide isomerase levels or degree of platelet activation.
PMC6430080	R05000	Since EC can secrete protein disulfide isomerase [10,49] and pecPDI modulates several EC effects, we assessed effects of incubation of PDI-poor or PDI-rich plasma in cultured EC.
PMC6430080	R05001	Cultured human umbilical vein EC (HUVEC) were incubated for 24 h in medium with standard FBS (5%) or in medium in which FBS was replaced with 5% plasma collected from individuals with low or high protein disulfide isomerase levels, and the patterns of EC gene expression and protein secretion were assessed.
PMC6430080	R07000	Having shown correlation of specific protein signatures and associated EC phenotypes with plasma protein disulfide isomerase levels, we inquired whether the distinct observed plasma profiles correlate with functional EC outcomes.
PMC6451724	A00005	Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase (Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase) levels were positively associated with both incident type 2 diabetes and prediabetes.
PMC6451724	A00007	Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase, adiponectin, apolipoprotein A-IV, apolipoprotein C-II, C-reactive protein, and glycosylphosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase D1 were associated with individual continuous outcomes.
PMC6451724	A00008	The combination of Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase, apolipoprotein E (apoE) and adiponectin improved diabetes prediction on top of both reference models, while prediabetes prediction was improved by Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase plus CRP on top of the HbA1c model.
PMC6451724	A00009	In conclusion, our mass spectrometric approach revealed a novel association of Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase with incident type 2 diabetes and incident prediabetes.
PMC6451724	A00010	In combination, Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase, adiponectin and apoE improved type 2 diabetes prediction beyond non-invasive risk factors or HbA1c, age and sex.
PMC6451724	D00000	This large SRM-MS-based cohort study discovered a novel association between Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase protein levels and both incident type 2 diabetes as well as incident (pre)diabetes even after adjustment for established risk factors and biomarkers.
PMC6451724	D00001	This means that Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase levels are not only elevated relatively shortly before the onset of type 2 diabetes but already in those normoglycemic individuals who will progress to (pre)diabetes during the next 6.5 years.
PMC6451724	D00002	The results of this study also clearly show that Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase together with apoE and adiponectin improves the prediction of type 2 diabetes on top of non-invasive risk factor variables and on top of age, sex, and HbA1c concentrations, which are well-known to have a high predictive power [30].
PMC6451724	D01000	Our previous cross-sectional investigation of the KORA F4 study showed that, compared to normoglycemic persons, prediabetic and diabetic cases had higher Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase plasma levels.
PMC6451724	D01001	Moreover, higher Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase levels were associated with both higher fasting and 2-h-glucose levels [23].
PMC6451724	D02000	The current prospective investigation, in which we newly measured protein data for more than two thirds of the studied persons, adds that Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase plasma levels are already elevated years before type 2 diabetes or (pre)diabetes developed.
PMC6451724	D02002	In our data Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase was specifically associated with elevated 2-h-glucose concentrations suggesting that particularly insulin secretion after glucose stimulation may be impaired.
PMC6451724	D03000	Since our Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase signal stems from peptides which are proteotypic for the three isoforms MASP-1, MASP-3, and MAP44, a clear discrimination between these isoforms is currently not possible.
PMC6451724	D03001	MASP-1 is the most abundant serine protease of the complement lectin pathway and thus a major player in the complement cascade which is initiated when a complex comprising mannose-binding lectin (MBL), MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs: MASP-1, MASP-2, MASP-3) and MBL-associated proteins (MAP19 and MAP44) binds to its target carbohydrate-containing ligands, primarily derived from pathogens or damaged tissues [33, 34].
PMC6451724	D04003	All three apolipoproteins correlate positively with the total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio and triglycerides [23] (although this fact is not completely understood for apoC-II, because this apolipoprotein is an essential cofactor for the lipoprotein lipase which mediates triglyceride hydrolysis [39]).
PMC6451724	D07002	Nevertheless, Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase, apoE, and adiponectin improved the prediction on top of HbA1c, age and sex to a similar extent in terms of the IDI- and NRI-metrics as on top of the GDRSadapted reference model.
PMC6451724	D07003	Second, the combination of the circulating biomarkers Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase, apoE, adiponectin, HbA1c, age and sex predicted diabetes equally well as the GDRSadapted-variables and HbA1c.
PMC6451724	D07005	HbA1c combined with information on age and sex is highly predictive, and the additional assessment of the circulating proteins Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase, apoE and adiponectin may improve the prediction even further.
PMC6451724	D09003	However, on top of HbA1c, age, and sex, Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase combined with CRP improved (pre)diabetes prediction significantly in terms of both IDI- and cfNRI-metrics.
PMC6451724	D11001	Moreover, it was unclear to which protein isoform the Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase signal belonged.
PMC6451724	F24002	Mannan-binding lectin (MBL)-associated serine protease-1 (MASP-1), a serine protease associated with humoral pattern-recognition molecules: normal and acute-phase levels in serum and stoichiometry of lectin pathway components.

PMC6451724	M11001	Because the Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase protein signal comprised peptides derived from different protein isoforms, we conducted sensitivity analyses on the association between the individual Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase peptides and incident type 2 diabetes.
PMC6451724	R01000	After adjustment for age, sex, waist and height (model 1), the levels of adiponectin were inversely and of apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II), apoC-III, apoE, and Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase positively associated with incident type 2 diabetes (Supplemental Table 2).
PMC6451724	R01001	Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase levels were also positively associated with incident (pre)diabetes.
PMC6451724	R01003	[95% CI 0.617, 0.999] and Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase (1.306 [1.052, 1.621]) remained significantly associated with incident type 2 diabetes (Fig. 2); Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase also remained significantly associated with incident (pre)diabetes (1.241 [1.036, 1.486]).
PMC6451724	R02001	In the sensitivity analysis investigating separate associations between the three measured Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase peptides and incident diabetes, the ‘TGVI’ peptide showed the strongest association (OR per sex-specific SD = 1.392 [95% CI 1.132, 1.711], model 2a), followed by ‘AAGN’ (1.260 [1.024, 1.551]) and ‘SLPT’ (1.104 [0.897, 1.359]).
PMC6451724	R03001	Positive associations were observed for apoC-II with fasting glucose, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR, for C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as for glycosylphosphatidylinositol specific phospholipase D1 (GPLD1) with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR, and for apoA-IV and Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase with 2-h-glucose.
PMC6451724	R04001	A subset of three out of all 14 proteins, namely Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase, adiponectin and apoE, was found to best improve the prediction on top of the non-invasive risk factors, with an AUC of 0.772 [0.712, 0.828].
PMC6451724	R07001	For the GDRSadapted reference model only Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase and for the age, sex, and HbA1c reference model, the combination of Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase and CRP was selected as predictor in stepwise logistic regression analysis.
PMC6451724	R07002	While Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase did not add statistically significant information on top of the GDRSadapted-variables, Mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase combined with CRP improved the (pre)diabetes prediction on top of age, sex, and HbA1c with an IDI of 0.021 [0.005, 0.036] and a cfNRI of 0.270
PMC6471199	D03009	Besides α-lactalbumin, bile salt-activated lipase belongs to the 15 most important enzymes in Chinese and Dutch human milk during lactation (Table 1).
PMC6471199	D03010	Bile salt-activated lipase supports the digestion of fats in the immature infant digestive tract, and facilitates the absorption of cholesterol, vitamin A, and triacylglycerols
PMC6471199	D04000	Proteases may play a key role in the digestion of human milk.
PMC6471199	D04001	Although trypsin was the most abundant protease in Chinese and Dutch human milk, many other proteases (e.g., cytosol aminopeptidase, elastase, kallikrein, plasmin, cathepsins) were found, albeit to a lesser extent (Supplementary Information, data file).
PMC6471199	D04002	As described by others, proteases might be present in human milk to hydrolyze proteins in the mammary gland to regulate casein micelle size [14,15].
PMC6471199	D04003	Protein digestion in human milk by proteases target specific proteins (e.g., caseins, polymeric immunoglobulin receptor, osteopontin) that do not have an extensive tertiary structure and are thus more accessible to proteolytic cleavage [16,18].
PMC6471199	D04005	In particular, the caseins are well digested [16,17,18], which indicates that proteases and bile salt-activated lipase in human milk aids overall in the digestion of two of its main macronutrients, fats and proteins [19].
PMC6471199	D05000	Besides proteases, human milk also contains protease inhibitors.
PMC6471199	D05003	As described by others, α1-antichymotrypsin binds to chymotrypsin and other chymotrypsin-like serine proteases in human milk, while α1-antitrypsin inhibits proteases, such as trypsin, elastase, plasmin, and thrombin, and irreversibly deactivates trypsin in vitro [12,13,14,15].
PMC6471199	D06000	Where some of the major proteins are partially digested by milk proteases in human milk, most immune-active proteins are less sensitive to digestion by these proteases, due to their compact folded globular structure, that cannot be as easily digested [16].
PMC6471199	D08002	This, together with the results presented in Table 2 and Table S2, indicates that the differences between Chinese and Dutch human milk serum proteins were mainly in their level throughout lactation, and not in their changes over lactation, as the levels of only 2 of the 166 (circa 1%) common serum proteins identified in this study (myristoylated alanine-rich c-kinase substrate and elongation factor 2) differed over the course of lactation (Figure 5, area A, showing difference in slope).
PMC6471199	R07001	Within the group enzymes, the highly abundant α-lactalbumin and bile salt-activated lipase are mainly responsible for the changes in this group in human milk over the course of lactation (Table 1).

PMC6496011	D01002	Despite these data, the endogenous FA pathway did not become a focus of clinical interest as a means to treat or diagnose human cancer until the early 1990s, when Kuhajda and colleagues unambiguously identified through sequence homology and enzymology the Oncogenic Antigen‐519 (OA‐519) – a prognostic molecule found in tumour cells from breast cancer patients with markedly worsened prognosis – as fatty acid synthase, the key metabolic multienzyme that is responsible for the terminal catalytic step in the de novo FA biogenesis (Medes et al. 1953; Greenstein 1954;
PMC6496011	D01005	Recent clinical and basic research studies have evidenced that up‐regulation of fatty acid synthase gene expression and fatty acid synthase biosynthetic activity are molecular events accompanying the pathogenesis and natural history of cancer disease (Menendez & Lupu 2004, 2006;
PMC6496011	D01008	Second, FA synthesis in cancer cells is transcriptionally regulated either hormonally or through oncogene signalling via kinase pathways, not by diet as occurs in lipogenic tissues.
PMC6496011	D01009	Third, the consequences of fatty acid synthase inhibition differ widely between cancer and normal cells as fatty acid synthase blockade rapidly induces apoptosis in human cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo with no effects towards normal cells, thus implying the reliance of cancer cell survival on FASN activity.
PMC6496011	D02000	Thought specific fatty acid synthase blockade revert oncogene‐induced malignant phenotypes such as anchorage‐independent cell growth, increased cell survival and/or chemoresistance, FASN‐dependent endogenous de novo FA biosynthesis is largely considered, similarly to anaerobic glycolysis, as a metabolic feature necessary to maintain the state of malignant transformation.
PMC6496011	D02002	To definitely consider fatty acid synthase as a metabolic oncogene in breast cancer disease, transfection of non‐cancerous breast epithelial cells with the fatty acid synthase gene should lead to its tumourigenic conversion in a dose‐dependent manner as assessed by growth under serum‐free conditions, growth in soft agar and growth as xenografts in nude mice.
PMC6496011	D02003	Our current findings do not definitely establish an oncogenic role for fatty acid synthase but reveal, for the first time in the best of our knowledge, that the sole up‐regulation of fatty acid synthase expression and activity in non‐cancerous breast epithelial cells can, on its own, trigger the activation of key members of the HER network which, in turn, induce a breast cancer‐like phenotype functionally dependent on the TK activity of the HER1/HER2 duo.
PMC6496011	D02006	This study strongly suggests that fatty acid synthase overexpression potently increases the signal‐to‐noise ratio in the HER1/HER2‐driven oncogenic signalling and therefore recapitulates the ability of HER2 to potently amplify signalling through the HER network: first, HER2 auto‐activation upon fatty acid synthase overexpression is accompanied not only by an increased Tyr‐phosphorylation of HER1 but also further with a significant up‐regulation of HER1 protein expression.
PMC6496011	D02008	This HER1/2‐dependence of FASN‐induced enhanced cell survival (e.g. growth in soft agar) and protection from apoptosis (e.g. chemoresistance) resulted obvious when monitoring the responses of HBL100 cells transiently overexpressing fatty acid synthase to HER‐targeted TKis, as they become significantly more sensitive to the HER1 TKi gefitinib while acquiring an exquisite cytotoxic response to the HER1–HER2 dual inhibitor lapatinib.
PMC6496011	D03000	The unexpected ability of fatty acid synthase overexpression to function as an oncogenic‐like stimulus in normal breast epithelial cells may drastically modify our perspective on the role of endogenous FA biogenesis in breast cancer biology.
PMC6496011	D03001	Most of our current notions clearly establish that breast cancer‐associated fatty acid synthase represents a growth factors/growth factor receptors‐driven change in the genetic program controlling lipogenesis through sterol regulatory element‐binding proteins (SREBPs), a family of transcription factors that coordinately activate genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and FAs (Swinnen 2001; Eberle et al. 2004).
PMC6496011	D03002	Changes in up‐stream regulatory circuits (e.g. activation of the HER network by either gene amplification of HER members or by overproduction of HER ligands) lead to down‐stream activation of the transduction cascades Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK and PI‐3′K/AKT, and ultimately to SREBP‐dependent up‐regulation of fatty acid synthase gene expression (Fig. 6, left panel) (Menendez & Lupu 2004, 2006;
PMC6496011	D03004	In this scenario, an active fatty acid synthase signalling is necessary for the maintenance of the transformed phenotype.
PMC6496011	D03006	The data presented here demonstrate that low levels of basal HER1/HER2 activity in non‐cancerous breast epithelial cells can be dramatically enhanced by fatty acid synthase overexpression.
PMC6496011	D03008	In this alternative scenario, FASN‐induced activation of the HER network would indirectly up‐regulate SREBP‐driven fatty acid synthase gene expression and therefore fatty acid synthase hyperactivity may create, on its own, a feed‐back able to continuously maintain high levels of FASN in breast cancer cells.
PMC6496011	D03009	Indeed, we recently observed that pharmacological and siRNA‐induced inhibition of fatty acid synthase in breast cancer cells negatively regulates its own expression by shutting‐down fatty acid synthase gene promoter activity (data not shown).
PMC6496011	D04001	While it is unlikely that FASN‐catalysed de novo FA biogenesis may have a direct role in immortalization, our current findings support the notion that fatty acid synthase overexpression/hyperactivation would impart immortalized breast epithelial cells with a profound neoplastic advantage over those maintaining physiological levels of endogenous FA biogenesis.
PMC6496011	D04002	Although we acknowledge that animal experiments are needed to substantiate this hypothesis, a very recent report by Priolo et al. (2006) revealed that the ubiquitin‐specific protease 2a (USP2a), which interacts and stabilizes fatty acid synthase in prostate cancer cells (Graner et al. 2004), exhibits oncogenic behaviour both in vitro and in vivo and prevented apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic agents when overexpressed in non‐transformed cells (Priolo et al. 2006).
PMC6496011	D04003	Therefore, fatty acid synthase can be considered an oncogene in prostate cancer disease by virtue of its ability to enhance tumour cell survival.
PMC6496011	D04004	Considering that the transforming ability of USP2a‐induced fatty acid synthase up‐regulation was accompanied, similarly to our current findings, by up‐regulation of some members of the HER network (Priolo et al. 2006), it is reasonable to suggest that exacerbated endogenous FA biogenesis in the breast epithelium may also represents a previously unrecognized oncogenic stimulus in mammary tumourigenesis.
PMC6496011	D04005	Supporting this notion, a recent study characterizing genome‐wide changes accompanying knockdown of fatty acid synthase in breast cancer cells (Knowles & Smith 2007) evidenced the ability of fatty acid synthase to modulate a wide network of pathways that regulate several aspects of tumour function, including metabolism, cell survival/proliferation, DNA replication/transcription, and protein degradation.
PMC6496011	D05000	The concept that fatty acid synthase overexpressipon/hyperactivation would impart immortalized cells with a profound neoplasic growth/survival advantage over those maintaining physiological levels of endogenous FA biosynthesis strongly suggests that fatty acid synthase can work as a previously unrecognized metabolic intermediate of oncogenesis linking cellular anabolism and malignant transformation.

PMC6496011	I01000	Most attention in the past few years has been directed at fatty acid synthase (fatty acid synthase), the main enzyme involved in FA synthesis, that catalyses NADPH‐dependent condensation of acetyl‐coenzyme A (CoA) and malonyl‐CoA, mainly to produce palmitate (Wakil 1989; Smith 1994; Maier et al. 2006).
PMC6496011	I01001	Up‐regulation of fatty acid synthase gene expression is an early event in breast cancer development, being more pronounced in more advanced tumours, and correlating with poorer prognoses (Kuhajda et al. 1994; Kuhajda 2000, 2006).
PMC6496011	I01002	Studies with either chemical inhibitors of fatty acid synthase activity or RNAi‐mediated down‐regulation of fatty acid synthase gene expression have revealed that FASN blockade dramatically impacts on breast cancer cells as they cease proliferation and ultimately die mainly by an apoptotic process (Pizer et al. 1998; Menendez et al. 2004a, 2005b).
PMC6496011	I01003	On the basis of these findings, it has been proposed that breast cancer cells benefit from fatty acid synthase hyperactivity in terms of enhanced cell proliferation, cell survival and metastasis, and increased resistance to chemo‐ and endocrine‐therapies (Lupu & Menendez 2006a, 2006b; Menendez & Lupu 2006).
PMC6496011	I01006	Thus, activation of fatty acid synthase gene in breast carcinomas cells is commonly viewed as a mere (down‐stream) manifestation of early and common deregulation of (up‐stream) regulatory circuits (e.g. hormones/growth factors hormone receptors/growth factor receptors lipogenic transcription factors lipogenic genes) (Kuhajda 2006;
PMC6496011	I02000	We have recently demonstrated that pharmacological and RNAi‐mediated inhibition of fatty acid synthase profoundly affects expression, activity and/or cellular localization of proteins closely related to breast malignant transformation and/or breast cancer progression, including Her‐2/neu (erbB‐2), HIF‐1α, vascular endothelial growth factor, oestrogen receptor, mitogen‐activated protein kinase, p53‐p21WAF1/CIP1, p27Kip1 and BRCA1 (Menendez & Lupu 2004, 2006; Menendez et al. 2004a,2004c, 2004d, 2005b, 2005e,f; Lupu & Menendez 2006a).
PMC6496011	I02001	These studies indirectly suggested that breast cancer‐associated fatty acid synthase (also called oncogenic antigen‐519; OA‐519) is not only necessary to integrate a number of signalling pathways that regulate metabolism, proliferation and survival in breast cancer cells, but also it plays an active role in breast cancer evolution.
PMC6496011	I02002	Although forced overexpression and/or overactivation of fatty acid synthase in normal breast epithelial cells (or in cells of transgenic animals) represents the sole valid approach to establish whether endogenous FA biogenesis is sufficient to promote transition from precursor lesions to invasive breast cancer phenotypes, no previous experimental studies have examined this possibility.

PMC6496011	I02006	Here, we present evidence that FASN‐catalysed endogenous FA biogenesis, on its own can trigger an invasive breast cancer‐like phenotype, functionally dependent on tyrosine kinase activity of HER1 (EGFR) and HER2, thus recapitulating a complex cross‐talk existing in many breast carcinomas with the worst prognosis.
PMC6496011	R00000	Transient transfection with the plasmid pCMV6‐XL4 carrying the full‐length human fatty acid synthase cDNA enhances fatty acid synthase protein expression and de novo FA synthesis in HBL100 breast epithelial cells.
PMC6496011	R00008	Importantly for this study, HBL100 cells naturally express extremely low levels of fatty acid synthase (Fig. 2a).
PMC6496011	R01000	Because neoplastic development is commonly associated with altered expression of oncogenes and/or tumour suppressor genes, we here hypothesized that, if indeed oncogenic, the sole up‐regulation of fatty acid synthase gene expression should trigger a breast cancer‐like phenotype in low (non‐tumourigenic) passage levels (< 12) of HBL100 cells.
PMC6496011	R01001	HBL100 cells were transiently transfected (up to 48 h) with the plasmid pCMV6‐XL4 carrying the full‐length human fatty acid synthase cDNA
PMC6496011	R01006	Upon this approach, immunoblotting procedures using an anti‐FASN monoclonal antibody revealed a ∼5‐fold up‐regulation of fatty acid synthase protein expression over that endogenously expressed by parental and mock (empty vector)‐transfected HBL100 cells (Fig. 2a, bottom panel).
PMC6496011	R01007	FASN‐associated lipogenic activity, which was measured by recording spectrophotometrically the linear increase in NADPH oxidation following the addition of the fatty acid synthase substrate malonyl‐CoA, was increased by ∼8 times when compared to basal fatty acid synthase activity in parental and mock‐transfected HBL100 cells (Fig. 2a, top panel).
PMC6496011	R01008	To further corroborate these findings, mock‐ and pCMV6‐XL4/FASN‐transfected HBL100 cells were exposed to 2‐14C‐labelled acetate, allowing the measurement of the effects of acute fatty acid synthase overexpression on lipid synthesis in live cells.
PMC6496011	R02000	Acute overexpression of fatty acid synthase enhances anchorage‐independent growth of breast epithelial cells.
PMC6496011	R02002	HBL100 cells forced to transiently overexpress fatty acid synthase for 48 h significantly increased, when monitored 10 days later, both the size and the number of colonies in semisolid cultures (∼200 colonies; 50 µm > ∅ > 100 µm) when compared to parental and mock‐transiently transfected cells (∼75 colonies; 25 µm > ∅ > 100 µm) (Fig. 2c).
PMC6496011	R02003	Malignant conversion of HBL100 cells at high passage level (> 50), which was evidenced in our experiments by enhanced growth in soft agar (data not shown), was likewise accompanied by a significant increase in both the endogenous level of fatty acid synthase expression and the lipid synthesis in live HBL100 cells (Fig. 2d).
PMC6496011	R03000	To assess whether FASN‐related growth advantage in semisolid conditions took place through either an induction of the proliferative potential and/or an enhancement of the anti‐apoptotic phenotype of HBL100 cells, we first investigated the effect of fatty acid synthase overexpression on cell proliferation and cell survival in low‐serum (i.e. 0.1% FBS) conditions.
PMC6496011	R03001	After 0, 24, 48, 72 or 96 h of transfection either with the plasmid pCMV6‐XL4 carrying the full‐length human fatty acid synthase cDNA or with the empty vector pCMV6‐XL4, cells were collected, and cell growth and viability were determined using a trypan blue dye exclusion assay.
PMC6496011	R03002	Of note, the proliferative rate was significantly higher in HBL100 cells acutely engineered to overexpress fatty acid synthase than in mock‐transfected and parental HBL100 cells (Fig. 2e).
PMC6496011	R03005	Interestingly, NIH‐3T3 murine fibroblasts transiently engineered to overexpress human fatty acid synthase exhibited an enhanced proliferative rate despite the presence of FBS‐containing free FAs in culture (Fig. 2f).
PMC6496011	R03006	Bromodeoxyuridine incorporation experiments confirmed that fatty acid synthase overexpression significantly increased proliferation of HBL100 and NIH‐3T3 cells (data not shown).
PMC6496011	R04000	To evaluate a role of the lipogenic activity of fatty acid synthase in the enhanced transforming ability of breast epithelial cells, parallel cell viability experiments were carried out in the presence of C75 [trans‐4‐carboxy‐5‐octyl‐3‐methylenebutyrolactone], a slow‐binding inhibitor of fatty acid synthase activity (Kuhajda et al. 2000; Pizer et al. 2000; Zhou et al. 2003; Alli et al. 2005; Lupu & Menendez 2006b).
PMC6496011	R04002	In contrast, C75‐induced inhibition of fatty acid synthase activity did not affect proliferation or viability of mock‐transfected and parental HBL100 cells (data not shown).
PMC6496011	R04004	Conversely, HBL100 cells transiently transfected with no insert (mock transfection) showed no significant changes following pharmacological blockade of endogenous fatty acid synthase activity (∼10% reduction in cell viability).
PMC6496011	R04005	We finally evaluated whether this exacerbated sensitivity to the fatty acid synthase blocker C75 was not simply the result of changes in FASN‐enhanced cell proliferation, but might actually be due to changes in FASN‐decreased apoptotic cell death.
PMC6496011	R04006	To address this question, pCMV6‐XL4‐ and pCMV6‐XL4/FASN‐transfected HBL100 cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of the fatty acid synthase blocker C75, apoptotic cell death was measured by a cell death ELISA specifically detecting apoptosis‐induced DNA‐histone fragmentation, and the x‐fold increase in apoptosis was calculated by comparing the ELISA optical density readings of treated samples, with the values of untreated cells as 1.0 (Fig. 3b).
PMC6496011	R04007	Whereas parental and mock‐transfected HBL100 cells exhibited extremely low levels of apoptosis upon treatment with C75 (1.7‐fold increase versus 1.0‐fold in untreated HBL100 cells), HBL100 cells engineered to overexpress fatty acid synthase were exquisitely sensitive to the pro‐apoptotic effects of C75 (up to 8.1‐fold increase versus 1.0‐fold in untreated HBL100/pCMV6‐XL4/FASN cells).
PMC6496011	R05000	Acute overexpression of fatty acid synthase enhances the tyrosine‐kinase activity of HER1 (EGFR) and HER2 in breast epithelial cells.
PMC6496011	R05001	What is the ultimate mechanism(s) by which acute activation of fatty acid synthase drives the acquired transformed phenotype of HBL100 cells?
PMC6496011	R05003	Therefore, we speculated that the proliferative and anti‐apoptotic phenotype induced by fatty acid synthase overexpression should be due to changes in the activity and/or expression of key ‘master‐proteins’ regulating breast cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis.
PMC6496011	R05005	Gross et al. 2004; Marmor et al. 2004; Citri & Yarden 2006), we monitored changes in the cellular pattern of Tyr‐phosphorylation upon transient transfection with human fatty acid synthase cDNA in HBL100 cultures at similar densities.
PMC6496011	R05006	Remarkably, a dramatic hyperactivation of several phosphotyrosine‐Tyr‐containing proteins – as evidenced by the pattern of Tyr‐phosphorylated bands detected by the 4G10 antiphosphotyrosine‐Tyr monoclonal antibody – was detected in cell lysates from HBL100 cells acutely overexpressing fatty acid synthase for 24 and 48 h (Fig. 4a).
PMC6496011	R05010	Moreover, when HBL100 cells were forced to overexpress fatty acid synthase gene in the presence of the chemical fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75, they did not exhibit any significant up‐regulation of phosphotyrosine‐Tyr‐containing proteins (Fig. 4b).
PMC6496011	R06000	To investigate whether FASN‐induced trans‐activation of the HER network members HER1 and HER2 was a molecular phenomenon not restricted to HBL100 cells and to evaluate whether an exacerbated endogenous FA metabolism affected phospho‐receptor Tyr‐kinases other than HER1 and HER2, we took advantage of the recently developed Human Proteome Profiler™ (R&D Systems Inc.).
PMC6496011	R06001	This rapid, sensitive and semiquantitative protein array technology can simultaneously identify and screen the levels of Tyr‐phosphorylation of up to 42 receptor Tyr‐kinases (RTKs) without performing numerous immunoprecipitation and/or immunoblotting analyses.
PMC6496011	R06005	In the presence of the fatty acid synthase blocker C75, FASN‐promoted HER1/HER2 hyperactivation was decreased to, and even below, the baseline HER1 activation levels found in matched control MCF10A transiently transfected with the pCMV6‐XL4/FASN empty vector.
PMC6496011	R06006	The proliferative rate was significantly higher in MCF10A cells acutely forced to overexpress fatty acid synthase than in mock‐transfected and parental MCF10A cells (data not shown) while exposure to chemical fatty acid synthase inhibitor C75 drastically impaired cell viability, with some FASN‐overexpressing MCF10A cells noticeably exhibiting apoptotic features (Fig. 4c).
PMC6496011	R07000	Although less markedly than when acutely overexpressed in HBL100 cells, transient transfection of fatty acid synthase gene was capable to significantly enhance the ability of MCF10A cells to grow upon anchorage‐independent conditions (Fig.
PMC6496011	R08000	Acute overexpression of fatty acid synthase enhances the expression of HER1 (EGFR) and HER2 in breast epithelial cells.
PMC6496011	R08003	Because this complex cross‐talk between HER1 and HER2 appeared to be recapitulated following acute activation of FASN‐driven endogenous lipogenesis in our experimental models, we next asked whether transient up‐regulation of fatty acid synthase did not only affect the activation status of HER1 and HER2 but further modulated their expression levels.
PMC6496011	R08004	HER2‐specific ELISA employed to quantitatively assess the expression of this receptor detected a significant 120% increase in HER2 expression following transient transfection of HBL100 cells with human fatty acid synthase cDNA
PMC6496011	R08009	Therefore, HBL100 cells engineered to overexpress fatty acid synthase did reach HER1 levels comparable to those found in breast cancer cells lines naturally exhibiting HER1‐gene amplification and HER1‐protein overexpression (e.g. ∼300 ng and 900 ng of EGFR per mg protein in BT20 and MDA‐MB‐468 cells, respectively) (Konecny et al. 2006).
PMC6496011	R09000	Acute overexpression of fatty acid synthase triggers a ‘HER1/HER2’‐dependent breast cancer phenotype.
PMC6496011	R09004	In order to measure FASN‐dependent changes in the degree of sensitivity to HER TKIs, a sensitization factor was determined by dividing the IC50 values for gefitinib and lapatinib (the concentration of the compounds necessary to reduce cell viability by 50%) in HBL100 cells transiently transfected with no insert (mock transfection) by those obtained in HBL100 cells transiently transfected with human fatty acid synthase cDNA.
PMC6496011	R09007	That is, acute fatty acid synthase overexpression was sufficient to increase > 15 times the sensitivity of HBL100 cells to lapatinib (Fig. 5b).

PMC6713475	D03002	Surprisingly, disruption of DCAF15, a poorly characterized substrate adaptor for the CRL4 E3 ligase, was a top scoring hit in both the MHC-I and NK screens.
PMC6713475	D05001	We were intrigued by these interactions given the similar CRISPR screening scoring pattern of DCAF15 to the cohesin factors STAG2 and HDAC8 (Figure 2E); the shared roles of cohesin and CRL4 E3 ligases in DNA metabolism, organization, replication and repair (Uhlmann, 2016; O'Connell and Harper, 2007; Litwin et al., 2018); and the ability of cohesin mutations to dysregulate hematopoietic differentiation in myeloid malignancies (Mazumdar and Majeti, 2017).

PMC6713475	R05001	Most surprisingly, the top-ranked mechanism for promoting NK-92 mediated clearance was disruption of DCAF15, an uncharacterized substrate adaptor for CRL4 ubiquitin E3 ligases.
PMC6713475	R22001	Recently, it was discovered that these agents work by binding DCAF15 and redirecting the ubiquitination activity of the CRL4-DCAF15 E3 ligase towards the essential splicing factor RBM39 (Han et al., 2017; Uehara et al., 2017).

PMC6714885	A00000	The public health impact of Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, GAS) as a top 10 cause of infection-related mortality in humans contrasts with its benefit to biotechnology as the main natural source of Cas9 nuclease, the key component of the revolutionary CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing platform.
PMC6714885	D00000	The discovery and molecular characterization of RNA-programmable Cas9 nuclease emerged from basic research on the type II CRISPR-Cas system from GAS and has provided a revolutionary biotechnological tool for genome engineering, with promising potential to develop novel strategies to fight and cure many diseases (Le Rhun et al., 2019).
PMC6714885	D05002	Similar evidence of Cas9 regulatory effect over virulence-related transcriptional regulators have been seen in GBS, where the nuclease influenced transcriptional regulator RegR, the modulator of hyaluronidase activity, a key virulence factor involved in GBS blood-brain barrier invasion during meningitis (Ma et al., 2018).
PMC6714885	D07000	Considering the highly specific endonuclease activity of Cas9, one potential mechanism underlying Cas9 effects on virulence regulation is that the nuclease may complex with the tracrRNA encoded inmediately downstram of Cas9 in the GAS genome (Figure 1A).

PMC6714885	I00001	CRISPR-Cas systems are widely distributed in many bacterial and archaeal genomes (Makarova et al., 2015; Burstein et al., 2016), and are evolutionarily classified in two main classes, with class II as the most representative and uniquely driven by the nuclease Cas9 (Makarova et al., 2015).
PMC6714885	I03000	Although Cas9 nuclease is found in many bacterial genomes, the native source of the Cas9 used in genome engineering is Streptococcus pyogenes (group A Streptococcus, GAS).
PMC6714885	R00000	To explore the functional role of Cas9 in GAS, we generated a precise in-frame allelic exchange mutant in the background of the well characterized globally disseminated GAS serotype M1T1 strain 5448 (Chatellier et al., 2000), wherein the cas9 gene in the type IIA CRISPR operon was replaced with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) gene (Figure 1A) as validated by PCR and sequence analysis.
PMC6714885	R00001	Functional confirmation of gene deletion in the GAS Δcas9 mutant strain was achieved in both mid-exponential and stationary growth phase cultures by real-time qPCR (Figure 1B) and western immunoblot using specific antibodies raised against the GAS nuclease (Figure 1C).
PMC6714885	R03002	The most enhanced subcategories in the Δcas9 mutant strain were “Sugar alcohols” and “Membrane Transport” (Figure 2A), including glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase (encoded by M5005_Spy0647) and cofactor transporters (encoded by cbiQ and cbiO1) (Supplementary Table S3).
PMC6714885	R03003	In contrast, the most pronounced subcategories enriched in the WT strain were “Electron Accepting Reactions” and “Respiration” (Figure 2A), including important bacterial metabolic proteins such as arsenate reductase (encoded by arcA), glycerol dehydrogenase (encoded by gdlA), and ferrodoxin (encoded by M5005_Spy0616) (Supplementary Table S3).
PMC6714885	R04004	Among these is HtrA, a serine protease directly associated with maturation of two key pathogenic factors: cysteine protease SpeB and pore-forming toxin streptolysin S (SLS) (Lyon and Caparon, 2004).
PMC6714885	R05000	Group A Streptococcus genes encoding proteins induced during human neutrophil phagocytosis (Voyich et al., 2003) were also significantly reduced in Cas9 deficiency, including detoxifiers of cell-damaging reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as AhpC and DnaK, and sortase A (sortase), the transpeptidase required for cell wall anchoring of surface virulence factors such as M protein, GRAB and protein F (Barnett and Scott, 2002; Raz and Fischetti, 2008).
PMC6714885	R07003	This included the master TCS CovR/CovS, which influences transcription of up to 15% of all GAS chromosomal genes, including repression of hyaluronic acid capsule, SLS precursor SagA, streptokinase (SkA), cysteine protease SpeB and other secreted GAS factors (Graham et al., 2002).
PMC6714885	R08002	Similarly, protein abundance levels of the transcriptional regulator PerR and the histidine kinase YvqE were reduced in the absence of Cas9; these proteins are known to directly upregulate GAS responses to oxidative stress and thereby enhancing resistance and virulence in the host (Grifantini et al., 2011), and signaling-mediated control of biofilm formation and pilus expression (Isaka et al., 2016), respectively.
PMC6714885	R09000	In summary, loss of Cas9 is associated with changes of several GAS virulence-related regulatory elements, generally fitting a pattern of reduced activators and enhanced repressors, suggesting an important role of the nuclease on the overall virulence of the bacterium.
PMC6714885	R10005	These findings were consistent with the proteomics results showing similar expression of hyaluronan synthase (hyaluronan synthase) in both strains (Supplementary Table S2).
PMC6714885	R11004	Reduction of cell wall-associated M protein could be also attributed to the reduced amounts of the specific M protein transcriptional activator (Mga) and/or its surface anchor sortase (sortase), found in the Δcas9 mutant by proteomics (Figures 2B,D, respectively).
PMC6714885	R15005	In summary, these data suggest that Cas9 plays an important role during GAS infection in vivo, and this effect might reflect influences of the nuclease on several different virulence phenotypes and virulence-related regulatory factors.

PMC6753514	R02001	Three CB datasets, containing more than 450 a Cu/Zn type dismutaseproteins, were compared with 2 clinical a Cu/Zn type dismutase datasets not linkedto long-term catheterization (UPS and UPN samples in Figure 1) and 1 CCPdataset, all yielding at least 175 Au protein identifications.
PMC6753514	R03000	The entire bacterial proteomic dataset is provided in Supplemental File S2, with proteins as annotated in the genomeof a Cu/Zn type dismutase strain ACS-120-V-Col10a and with their quantities.
PMC6753514	R05000	a Cu/Zn type dismutase expressed a putative C protein α-antigen containing aRib-α/Esp cell adhesion motif.
PMC6753514	R05001	a Cu/Zn type dismutase also expressed 2 LPXTG-motifproteins predicted to be cell wall-anchored and to interact via their N-terminaldomains with the extracellular milieu, including human host factors.
PMC6753514	R06000	Among the abundant proteins in Gs and a Cu/Zn type dismutasesurveyed from the in vivo milieu were Mpp-type ABC transporters predicted toimport di-/oligopeptides (GS_03780-GS_03785; AU_1619-AU_1626) and a few aminoacid transporters (Tables2 and ​and33,Figure 3).
PMC6753514	R06001	From hereon, the term AU_ replaces the a Cu/Zn type dismutase genome prefix HMPREF9243_.
PMC6753514	R07000	Proteomic data from CBs suggest that phosphotransferase system (PTS) is highlyimportant for sugar uptake by these microbes in the urinary tract.
PMC6753514	R07001	Thenon-specific subunits of PTS, PstP and HPr, were abundant in thea Cu/Zn type dismutase and Gs proteomes (both subunits in thetop 20% based on PSM data).
PMC6753514	R07002	A glucitol/sorbitol PTS was highly expressed bya Cu/Zn type dismutase.
PMC6753514	R07006	Both a Cu/Zn type dismutase andGs in vivo proteomes suggest an active metabolism ofN-acetylated glucosamine and mannosamine, amino sugars that are components ofmany glycosylated proteins and glycosaminoglycans exposed on urothelial cell surfaces,32 as well as bacterial cell wall peptidoglycans.

PMC6753514	R09000	While Gs and a Cu/Zn type dismutase are considered rareuropathogens, the UTI epidemiology literature suggests that group DStreptococci, particularly Enterococci,are far more common causes of UTI and CAUTI.40,41
PMC6753514	R09001	To some extent, this seemsto be due to greater difficulties to culture a Cu/Zn type dismutase andGs resulting in underestimated numbers and misdiagnosis ofclinical cases.2 Indeed, the attempts to isolate the a Cu/Zn type dismutase strain of P5 fromfrozen cell extracts and to revive it on blood agar under aerobic conditionsfailed.
PMC6753514	R09003	Due to the phylogenetic similarity,metabolic comparisons of a Cu/Zn type dismutase and Gs strainsfrom the CB milieu with that of Enterococci (E.faecalis) are appropriate.
PMC6753514	R09004	Like a Cu/Zn type dismutase andGs, the literature delineates that E.faecalis strains express a diversity of PTSs for the uptake ofsugars and that the glycolytic, citrate lyase and MAF pathways are used toproduce energy anaerobically.42 By adapting to a host milieu rich in amino sugars derived fromglycosaminoglycans and mucosal cell surface glycoproteins, E.faecalis expresses transporters for oligopeptides and amino sugarsas well as enzymes that feed these molecules into the peptidolysis andglycolytic pathways.42 Here, we demonstrate with a proteomic approach that a Cu/Zn type dismutaseand Gs express equivalent nutrient uptake systems andmetabolism pathways.

PMC6753514	R09007	Datasets that showed evidence of E.faecalis co-colonization in CBs (in P5 and patients who we do notreport on here) suggested a similarly high abundance for PflB/GrcA but not for apyruvate oxidase in the E. faecalis proteome.
PMC6753514	R10000	Enterococci and Streptococci produce anicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) oxidase (Nox), which is thought tocontribute to the regeneration of NAD+ to support glycolysis, and an NADHperoxidase (NADHperoxidase), which is important to decompose H2O2during aerobic growth and a likely virulence factor.42-44 Peroxide-producing enzymes(MPO, EPX) are generated in the CB milieu via the infiltrating activatedgranulocytes that generate oxidative stress.

PMC6923932	D03001	The IPA analysis predicted that downregulation of HSP90 would be linked with Akt, p38 Mitogen activated protein kinase and Extracellular signal regulated kinase signalling pathways.
PMC6923932	D03002	We observed an increased activation of ERK1/2 and reduced activation of Akt-kinase in calcified valves whereas there was no change in the phosphorylation of p38 Mitogen activated protein kinase.
PMC6923932	D03003	Previously, Akt and Extracellular signal regulated kinase have been shown to mediate leptin induced osteoblast differentiation [31].
PMC6923932	D03005	Furthermore, a study with cultured porcine VICs revealed that Extracellular signal regulated kinase inhibition reduced gene expression of myofibroblastic and osteoblastic markers [34].

PMC6923932	R06000	Among the novel putative interactions suggested by IPA, HSP90 was linked to Akt and Extracellular signal regulated kinase, and further to p38 Mitogen activated protein kinase (Fig. 4).
PMC6923932	R06001	Therefore, we conducted Western blot analyses to evaluate the activation of Akt, Extracellular signal regulated kinase and p38 Mitogen activated protein kinase kinases in control and stenotic valves.

PMC6941325	A02002	Furthermore, increased chymase activity in bile points to mast cell activation at the tumor site.
PMC6941325	A02004	The analysis further supports that the mapped proteases are drivers of local and systemic events.
PMC6941325	A03001	Proteases, extracellular matrix components, inflammatory cytokines, proangiogenic, growth and vasoactive factors released from the tumor microenvironment are drivers of systemic early events during CCA progression.
PMC6941325	D02002	Elevated transaminases, cholestatic parameters and bilirubin may reflect hepatobiliary inflammation and do not play a role for the detection of biliary malignancy.
PMC6941325	D04002	This was achieved by an in-depth literature search, as well as an in silico prediction of the proteases responsible for the cleavage of the peptide markers and identification of the relevant pathways by system biology methods and network analysis.
PMC6941325	D05000	By in silico protease mapping the proteases ADAMTS4, CMA1 and KLK4 were predicted to be increased in their activity in CCA, whereas CASP1 and KLK6 were predicted to be decreased.
PMC6941325	D05005	This is in perfect agreement with the aberrant expression pattern of kallikrein-related peptidases being implicated in EMT, as an EMT suppressor and an EMT promoter, respectively [36].
PMC6941325	D10003	Excessive ECM production by CAFs might together with the release of ECM-degrading proteases, like CMA1 from mast cells, be responsible for increased occurrence of collagen fragments in the urine of CCA patients.
PMC6941325	D13001	Based on the N- and C-terminal sequence motifs of the CCA peptide markers we used Proteasix to predict which proteases may be responsible for these CCA-associated changes in the proteolytic environment as part of the process leading to the CCA peptide markers.
PMC6941325	D15000	Transcriptomics data were inconclusive for the predicted proteases ADAMTS4, CMA1, CASP1, KLK4 and KLK6.
PMC6941325	D15001	However, regulation of these proteases typically occurs on the protein level, e.g. via prodomain removal in the case of ADAMTS4 [67], release from mast cell granules in the case of CMA1 [68] or self-cleavage in the case of CASP1 [69].
PMC6941325	D15002	Regulation of proteases is complex and tightly controlled by different mechanisms on the protein level such as conversion from an inactive precursor, allosteric inhibition by small molecules, storage in granules or post-translational modifications [70].
PMC6941325	D15003	Moreover, the proteases with decreased activity in CCA, namely CASP1 and KLK6, might be more prevalent in benign biliary disorders and in this respect the available transcriptomics data is rather sparse.
PMC6941325	D16002	For endogenous peptides, which emerge from degradation of proteins by certain proteases, an even higher level of complexity is introduced by the dynamic nature and plasticity of the proteolytic environment leading to increased occurrence of certain peptides from a particular protein precursor while other peptides from that protein may even disappear.

PMC7087397	I13005	Numerous activity-based probes (ABPs) have been developed and deployed for many enzyme classes, including serine hydrolases (Kidd et al., 2001; Liu et al., 1999), cysteine proteases (Kato et al., 2005), metallohydrolases, phosphatases, deubiquinating enzymes (Hewings et al., 2018;
PMC7087397	I13006	Ward et al., 2016), kinases (Zhao et al., 2017), various oxidreductases and others.
PMC7087397	I14002	The first class of enzymes targeted for ABPP studies were the serine hydrolases (SHs), a large and diverse family of enzymes that perform numerous roles in physiological and pathological processes.
PMC7087397	I15001	Electrophilic click-ABPs have been developed for kinases (Zhao et al., 2017), protein arginine deiminases (PADs) (Nemmara et al., 2018; Slack et al., 2011), ubiquitin machinery (An and Statsyuk, 2013; Hewings et al., 2018), cytochrome P450 enzymes (Wright and Cravatt, 2007), and glycosidase enzymes (Tsai et al., 2013).
PMC7087397	I15002	For example, high-throughput methods for profiling kinase inhibitors have typically relied on enzymatic activity or competitive binding readouts on isolated kinases, removed from native environments.
PMC7087397	I15003	Recent chemical proteomic methods have been developed which quantify inhibitor binding to endogenous kinases in complex proteomes through the use of bead-immobilized kinase inhibitors (‘kinobeads’)
PMC7087397	I15005	These platforms enabled the profiling of 150-200 endogenous kinases in a single cell line, however, neither are cell permeable, requiring membrane dissolution and disruption of protein complexes during lysis, potentially altering kinase conformation and activity.
PMC7087397	I15006	To overcome this limitation, the Tauton lab, in a collaboration with colleagues at Pfizer, developed a cell-permeable sulfonyl fluoride-based click probe (Figure 6) that target a conserved lysine in the ATP binding site which captures 133 phylogenetically diverse kinases in cells, 50 of which were not captured by kinobeads, highlighting the utility and complementarity of click ABPs to other platforms (Zhao et al., 2017).
PMC7087397	I16003	For example, a recent competitive ABPP screen against SHs led to the discovery of a selective and in vivo active covalent inhibitor of palmitoyl protein thioesterase (PPT1), mutations of which cause infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis.
PMC7087397	I16006	Recently, highly potent and orally available activity-based inhibitors were developed for monoacylglycerol lipase (monoacylglycerol lipase), an SH that controls the content and signaling of the endogenous cannabinoid 2-archidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the central nervous system.
PMC7087397	I17013	For example, competitive isoTOP-ABPP has been used to identify sites on proteins modified by lipid-derived electrophiles, such as oxidative stress product 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (HNE), resulting in modulation of endogenous proteins, such as ZAK kinase (Wang et al., 2014).
PMC7087397	I17016	Initial broad-reactive fragments identified in such studies have been used to develop lead covalent ligands of protein targets, including compounds that selectively target pro-caspase-8 (Backus et al., 2016) and the transcriptional regulator NR0B1 (Bar-Peled et al., 2017) to investigate their physiological and pathophysiological roles.
PMC7087397	I20002	For example, metalloproteases (MPs), a large and diverse group of enzymes that play key roles in a variety of physiological and pathological processes, use a zinc-activated water molecule for catalysis.
PMC7087397	I20004	Similarly, histone deacetylases utilize zinc-activated water in their active sites, enabling the development of zinc chelating suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) based click ABPs to profile HDAC activity in cells (Salisbury and Cravatt, 2007, 2008).
PMC7087397	I20007	Horning et al. described a set of S-adenosyl homocysteine (SAH) photoaffinity (diazirine and benzophenone) probes with a high selectivity for methyltransferases (MTs) in cells as well as MT inhibitor discovery via competitive ABPP (Horning et al., 2016).
PMC7087397	I21010	For example, simple fragment leads identified in comparative profiling studies were subsequently utilized in competitive profiling experiments (Figure 5B) to generate first-in-class inhibitors for prostaglandin reductase 2 (PTGR2) and the multi-pass transmembrane protein SLC25A20.
PMC7087397	I23003	Cell permeable click photoaffinity probes have been developed to characterize targets of various clinically approved drugs and inhibitors (Figure 6), including kinase inhibitors (Li et al., 2013; Shi et al., 2012), γ-secretase inhibitors (Ballard et al., 2014), β-secretase inhibitors (Zuhl et al., 2016), antibiotics (Eirich et al., 2011), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Gao et al., 2018), and epigenetic modulating compounds (Li et al., 2014; Montgomery et al., 2014) as well as natural products (Wright and Sieber, 2016).
PMC7087397	I23005	For example, photoaffinity click probes of a BACE1 β-secretase inhibitor revealed that cathepsin D (CatD) is a common off-target of several clinical BACE inhibitors, which may contribute to observed ocular toxicity in vivo (Zuhl et al., 2016).
PMC7087397	I23013	For example, click probes have been used to assess the target landscape of covalent kinase inhibitors (Gushwa et al., 2012; Lannine et al., 2014; Niessen et al., 2017) and various bioactive natural products (Wright and Sieber, 2016).
PMC7087397	I23014	Click probes have also recently been used to identify covalent targets of reactive drug metabolites, including that of the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) inhibitor BIA 10-2474 (Figure 6), a clinical candidate that failed Phase I trials due to serious neurotoxicity which led to the death of one human volunteer (Bateman et al., 2013; Huang et al., 2019; van Esbroeck et al., 2017).
PMC7087397	I27009	Once internalized, the O- acetates are removed by esterases and the resulting ManNAz can be biosynthetically transformed into an azide-containing sialic acid monosaccharide that is then added to the termini of N-linked and mucin O-linked glycans.
PMC7087397	I29002	Specifically, terminal GlcNAc moieties can be labeled using a combination of radioactive UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) and a β1,4-galactosyltransferase (galactosyltransferase), which generates a Gal-GlcNAc disaccharide on O-GlcNAcylated proteins that can be detected by autoradiography (Torres and Hart, 1984).
PMC7087397	I29003	Replacing the native galactosyltransferase with a mutant (Y289L) enabled the enzymatic transfer of N-azidoacetylgalactosamine (GalNAz) from UDP-GalNAz to generate a disaccharide bearing an azide for subsequent bioorthogonal chemistry (Table 1) (Clark et al., 2008).
PMC7087397	I31004	Again, the use of small bioorthogonal handles was absolutely required for this technology, as these relatively small modifications can be tolerated by the cellular metabolic and transferase enzymes.
PMC7087397	I31009	This same reporter was also combined with SILAC to identify myristoylation events that were sensitive to an N-myristoyltransferase inhibitor (Thinon et al., 2014).
PMC7087397	I32002	Acetate is added to proteins by a family of acetyltransferases that use the high-energy acetyl-CoA cofactor, and the modification can be removed by another family of deacetylases.
PMC7087397	I32004	However, these antibody tools cannot easily read out on the dynamics of protein acetylation or distinguish between the enzymatic modification of proteins by acetyltransferases versus the direct chemical modification by the reactive acetyl-CoA thioester.
PMC7087397	I32007	The utility of this short alkyne acid as an MCR for lysine acetylation was then bolstered by the fact that purified p300 acetyltransferase can utilize synthetic 4- pentynonyl-CoA to label proteins in cell lysates (Yang et al., 2011).
PMC7087397	I32012	More specifically, an alkyne-containing thioester was synthesized that mimics acetyl-CoA but cannot be used by acetyltransferases (Table 1) (Kulkarni et al., 2017).
PMC7087397	I33002	Methylation is added to proteins by distinct lysine- and arginine-methyltransferases that all use S-adenoyl-L- methionine (SAM) as a cofactor.
PMC7087397	I33003	The modification can then be removed by two families of demethylases that are defined by their differential enzymatic mechanisms.
PMC7087397	I33007	In vitro analysis demonstrated that these SAM analogs were accepted by a subset of the methyltransferases tested.
PMC7087397	I33008	These results suggested that pairs of bioorthogonal SAM reporters and methyltransferase mutants could be identified using a “bump-hole” strategy.
PMC7087397	I33010	This goal was subsequently realized through rational engineering of the methyltransferase active site, enabling the labeling and identification of methyltransferase-specific substrates (Table 1) (Islam et al., 2012; Islam et al., 2013).
PMC7087397	I34001	In humans, a family of 17 ADP-ribosyltransferases, termed poly-ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), can add this modification.
PMC7087397	I34002	Despite their name, the majority of PARPs appear to be mono-ADP-ribosyltransferases while a subset can generate poly-ADP-ribose through the extension of the ADP-ribose chain.
PMC7087397	I34003	This modification can also be rendered dynamic through removal by ADP-ribose hydrolases.
PMC7087397	I35006	Notably, this probe was used to identify a sulfenylated cysteine in the active site of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) that increases its kinase activity (Paulsen et al., 2011).
PMC7094015	M07000	Finally, to determine TNFR2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in ACs and ATL patients, semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed.
PMC7094015	M07003	Real-time polymerase chain reaction was completed on StepOnePlus (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA).
PMC7138261	D02001	APOC3 plays an important role in regulating lipid metabolism, inhibiting lipid lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase and reducing lacteal protein.
PMC7138261	D02003	It is generally estimated that abnormal lipid metabolism, particularly high triglyceride lipoprotein metabolism, is the main factor leading to atherosclerosis, while APOC3 can replace lipoprotein lipase, which leads to reduced lipolysis (31,32).

PMC7532684	I00003	Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting EGFR were used as the first-line treatment for patients with metastatic NSCLC whose tumors harbor EGFR mutations 5; however, those patients eventually develop acquired resistance through either secondary EGFR mutations, e.g., T790M, or activation of the bypass track signaling pathways, such as activation of RTK AXL to maintain persistent oncogenic EGFR signaling 6.

PMC7539533	D00001	Biochemistry and cell biology experiments (Figures 3, ​,4,4, ​,5,5, and ​and7)7) confirmed that pUL56 binds directly to GOPC, is both necessary and sufficient to promote GOPC degradation, requires the recruitment of the NEDD4 family of ubiquitin ligases via its PPXY motifs to stimulate GOPC ubiquitination and degradation, and results in changes in the cell-surface proteome through the loss of GOPC.
PMC7539533	D05001	Our IP-MS data revealed that pUL56 binds multiple cellular NEDD4 family ubiquitin ligases and the trafficking factor GOPC (Figure 3A).
PMC7539533	D05004	Taken together, these data demonstrate that pUL56 serves as a scaffold to bring GOPC and a NEDD4 family ubiquitin ligase together in order to promote GOPC ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation.
PMC7539533	D07001	For example, HIV-1 Vpu recruits an E3 ubiquitin ligase to promote the ubiquitination and degradation of several cell-surface proteins (Matheson et al., 2015).

PMC7539533	M20000	A combined database was constructed from (a) the human UniProt database (26th January, 2017), (b) HSV-1 strain KOS (GenBank entry JQ673480.1, manually updated with a single amino acid polymorphism in the ICP4 sequence identified in the KOS BAC strain used for virus generation), (c) common contaminants such as porcine trypsin and endoproteinase LysC. The combined database was concatenated with a reverse database composed of all protein sequences in reversed order.
PMC7539533	M34000	For bacterial recombinant expression, the cytoplasmic region (residues 1-207) of UL56 from HSV-1 strain KOS was cloned into a vector derived from pOPT (Teo et al., 2004) encoding Schistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase followed by a human rhinovirus 3C cleavage sequence fused to the N terminus and LysHis6 fused to the C terminus (GST-UL56(1-207)-His).

PMC7539533	R05000	ITCH, a member of the NEDD4 family of ubiquitin ligases, was rapidly depleted during HSV-1 infection (Figures 1B–1E).
PMC7539533	R05005	Several members of the NEDD4 family of ubiquitin ligases were enriched in the pUL56 IP, as were multiple trafficking protein particle complex II (TRAPPCII) subunits.
PMC7539533	R05007	Co-precipitation assays demonstrated that the purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged pUL56 cytoplasmic domain (residues 1–207) is capable of binding purified GOPC, confirming that these two proteins interact directly (Figure 3B).
PMC7539533	R05011	Taken together, these results suggest a model whereby pUL56 binds both GOPC and the NEDD4 family of ubiquitin ligases, bringing them in close proximity and thus stimulating the ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation of GOPC.
PMC7539533	R06005	HSV-1 pUL56 contains three PPXY motifs, which mediate interaction with the NEDD4 family of E3 ubiquitin ligases (Ushijima et al., 2010).

PMC7603755	D01000	M7GpppN-mRNA hydrolase is a decapping metalloenzyme that catalyzes the cleavage of the cap structure on mRNAs, specific to N7-methylated guanosine containing RNA, and thus influences mRNA turnover [39, 40].

PMC7603755	R04006	This is consistent with increased stress responses elicited by immune cell stimulation and the release of endopeptidases in SPSs upon activation by TB antigens.
PMC7603755	R04010	With respect to biological processes, GO terms more enriched in SPSs had a regulatory context (negative regulation of endopeptidase activity and regulation of complement activation).
PMC7603755	R04012	Indeed, proteins induced in SPSs had molecular function and biological process enrichments for the complement system, the acute phase response and endopeptidase activities (Fig. 6).
PMC7648178	A02004	The sequence-identified peptides are mainly fragments of collagen chains, uromodulin and Na/K-transporting ATPase subunit γ.
PMC7648178	A02005	We also identified ten putative proteolytic cleavage sites, eight were specific for matrix metallopeptidases and two for cathepsins.
PMC7648178	D05003	The restriction of the peptide markers to certain protein regions and the non-directional type of regulation of the COL1A1 peptide markers might be explained by sites of increased proteolytical accessibility and changes in the activity of ECM degrading proteases during fibrosis progression.
PMC7648178	D05004	In this respect, the comparison of the octamer amino acid motifs surrounding the N- and C-terminal ends of the 50 fibrosis peptide markers with already reported proteolytic cleavage sites reported in the CutDB, proteolytic event database[24] was performed and resulted in the identification of ten putative proteolytic cleavage sites, eight specific for matrix metallopeptidases and two for cathepsins [38,39].
PMC7648178	D06000	Our results on proteases predicted to be responsible for cleavage of our collagen markers are in agreement with the role of matrix metallopeptidases and cathepsins in liver fibrotic disease processes [40,41].

PMC7648178	D07000	To provide further evidence, we have compared our findings with tissue transcriptomics data of human cirrhotic and normal livers and found evidence for differential regulation of the targeted collagen chains and predicted proteases also in liver tissue.
PMC7648178	D08000	Finally, when the activity of the predicted proteases was assessed based on the associated peptide marker expressions in the patient's CE-MS peptide profiles [25], significance could be reached for the MMP's 2, 3, 13 and 14, as well as CTSB.
PMC7648178	D08001	Since for all of these proteases a decrease in activity was predicted in the case of LC, this leads us to the hypothesis based on literature findings [43,44] that mainly TIMP-2 might be the inducer and/or hepatorenal connector leading to the observed changes associated with liver fibrosis in the urinary peptidome.

PMC7812277	A00004	A prognostic risk score was developed and calculated using a linear and logistic regression model based on a combination of AGT, SERPINA1 and neuron‐specific enolase (neuron‐specific enolase) with an area under the curve of 0.865 (P < .001), and the prognostic risk score was positively correlated with the CPC value (R = 0.708, P < .001).
PMC7812277	D03002	In addition, a series of low‐abundance proteins, such as neuron‐specific enolase, was not determined in our serum samples because the sensitivity of LC‐MS/MS‐based serum proteomics is remarkably influenced by high‐abundance proteins, leading to difficulties in the determination of low‐abundance proteins.

PMC8038828	D00002	catalase is a crucial antioxidant enzyme that interacts with cellular H2O2 to produce water and oxygen [35].
PMC8038828	D00003	Under normal conditions, catalase levels are proportionate to H2O2.

PMC8054439	F84001	A secreted bacterial protease tailors the Staphylococcus aureus virulence repertoire to modulate bone remodeling during osteomyelitis.
PMC8054439	I00002	Produced alongside these are ten extracellular proteases: a metalloprotease (aureolysin, aur), a V8 (SspA) serine protease, two cysteine proteases (staphopain A [ScpA] and staphopain B [SspB]), and 6 serine-protease-like enzymes (SplABCDEF) (Reed et al., 2001; Shaw et al., 2004).
PMC8054439	I00004	In an early study by Coulter, a V8 protease mutant was shown to be attenuated in 3 separate animal models of infection (Coulter et al., 1998).
PMC8054439	I01000	More recently, our group analyzed a S. aureus strain (Δprotease) with all 10 proteases deleted (Kolar et al., 2013), finding that protease ablation increases the killing of infected mice.
PMC8054439	I01001	Proteomic analysis revealed that toxin and exoenzyme abundance had increased in cultures of Δprotease (Kolar et al., 2013).
PMC8054439	I01003	Accordingly, secreted proteases appear to be master regulators of virulence, by controlling the stability of S. aureus virulence factors.
PMC8054439	I02000	Converse to this, Δprotease displayed impaired blood survival, decreased phagocytosis resistance, increased sensitivity to AMPs, and impaired dissemination and/or survival during infection.
PMC8054439	I02001	Thus, the impairment in virulence of Δprotease stems from a key role for these enzymes in attacking the host, cleaving proteins that facilitate nutrition, immune evasion, and movement to new sites of infection.
PMC8054439	I02002	This notion is supported by in vitro literature where S. aureus-secreted proteases have been shown to cleave numerous human proteins, including elastin, plasminogen, fibronectin, fibrinogen, the heavy chains of all human immunoglobulin (Ig) classes, high-molecular-weight kininogen, human α1-proteinase inhibitor, α1-antichymotrypsin, and complement components (Wegrzynowicz et al., 1980; Potempa et al., 1986, 1988;
PMC8054439	I03000	A major bottleneck to the study of proteases has been the slow and complex nature of substrate identification.
PMC8054439	I03001	Much of the work performed thus far on S. aureus proteases has made use of purified protein and immunoblotting strategies, leading to a one-at-a-time approach for target identification.
PMC8054439	I03006	Discovery of previously unknown host substrates of viral proteases from Poliovirus and Coxsackievirus (Jagdeo et al., 2018) and Zika virus (Hill et al., 2018) using N-terminomics has also been recently described.
PMC8054439	I03007	However, with the exception of the work by Overall and colleagues during development of the TAILS N-terminomics method (described below), where fibroblast secretomes were degraded by bacterial GluC/V8 for the purposes of method validation (Kleifeld et al., 2010), N-terminomics approaches have not been used to study the impact of proteolysis at the host-bacteria-interface, or in discovery of novel host targets of bacterial proteases (Marshall et al., 2017).
PMC8054439	I04000	Of the S. aureus-secreted proteases, V8 is perhaps the most well understood, being first described in the 1970s (Drapeau et al., 1972), with its high proteolytic activity but strict specificity for cleavage after glutamic acid (and to a lesser extent aspartic acid residues) being well established (Drapeau et al., 1972; Sørensen et al., 1991).
PMC8054439	I04001	Therefore, to begin our investigation of protease-host substrate interactions, we selected the V8 protease and assessed its ability to cleave human serum proteins, an infection relevant source of soluble substrates.
PMC8054439	M03006	Mutants deficient in either sspA (encoding V8 protease) or all ten secreted proteases (ΔsspA and Δprotease, respectively) have been previously described (Kolar et al., 2013; Ramirez et al., 2020).
PMC8054439	M03008	This was then transduced using φ11 into the USA300 LAC strain (to produce Δspa) as well as the protease null strain to produce ΔspaΔprotease.
PMC8054439	M03010	All oligonucleotides used are described in Table S6, and all plasmid insertions achieved by PCR of inserts (described below), restriction digest using NEB restriction enzymes (Table S6), and ligation using a T4 ligase kit (Promega).
PMC8054439	M04001	S. aureus V8 protease was purchased from Sigma Aldrich (catalog no. P2922).
PMC8054439	M04003	Prior to N-terminomics and immunoblotting, all serum or albumin depleted (AD) serum was incubated at 37°C in the presence or absence of V8 protease (5–50 μg/ml for immunoblotting, 5 μg/ml for N-terminomics) for 16 hours.
PMC8054439	M05003	Dry guanidium hydrochloride (6 M final concentration) was added to inactivate proteases following incubation.
PMC8054439	M13006	This method of N-terminome analysis differs from previously described analyses due to its emphasis on unique N-terminal peptides, but highlights putative cleavage sites for the exogenous protease (V8 in this study), and is thus useful for studies of pathogen proteases in the host.
PMC8054439	R03008	The inhibitory effect on V8 of proline at P1′ (and to a lesser extent P3) is also observed in the MEROPS database (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/merops, [Rawlings et al., 2018], MEROPS: S01.269, glutamyl endopeptidase I).
PMC8054439	R07000	Regarding the host protease inhibitors, α−2 macroglobulin (A2M) was also extensively cleaved by V8, including in the bait region (BR), which is typically responsible for covalent binding and inactivation of serine proteases.
PMC8054439	R07003	V8 cleavage at these positions may act to destabilize A2M tertiary structure and could result in an inability to trap proteases, since conformational change subsequent to cleavage of the BR is a key part of inhibitory activity (Bowen and Gettins, 1998), where A2M encloses the active site of a target protease.
PMC8054439	R07004	Furthermore, the receptor binding domain (RBD) of A2M, which functions in the clearance of activated A2M-protease complexes, was also cleaved.
PMC8054439	R07010	In addition to evasion of the protease-trapping mechanism in a fashion similar to A2M, inactivation of SERPINs may be directly relevant to pathogenesis, with epithelial cell-derived SERPINs (SCCA1 and SCCA2) shown to inhibit S. aureus cysteine protease degradation of SERPINs (Kantyka et al., 2011) thereby preventing entrapment.
PMC8054439	R07012	Neutrophil elastase can cause tissue damage and is inhibited by SERPINA1, but the host-derived MMP-9 (gelatinase-B) regulates this inhibitory effect by degrading the SERPIN (Liu et al., 2000).
PMC8054439	R07013	Thus, V8 may enhance host tissue damage indirectly through dysregulation of neutrophil elastase.
PMC8054439	R11003	Three functional clusters can be observed: the complement and clotting cascades, and protease (inter-α-trypsin) inhibitors.
PMC8054439	R12005	This notion of proteases assisting dissemination by cleavage of host factors fits with the phenotypic switching seen during S. aureus growth, where a population of S. aureus reaches a sufficient density, inducing the Agr quorum sensing system, which promotes protease production and reduces biofilm formation (Boles and Horswill, 2008).
PMC8054439	R14001	Several of the identified V8 substrates are known to act (through intermediates) with the ubiquitously expressed extracellular signal related kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2, ERK not observed in the N-terminome), which were also highlighted during our analysis.
PMC8054439	R14002	ERKs are intracellular phosphokinases, activated by a variety of plasma membrane receptors in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli (Roux and Blenis, 2004).
PMC8054439	R14003	ERK signaling is directly relevant to S. aureus-host immune cell interactions and is susceptible to perturbation by secreted proteases, as seen for ScpA, which degrades the neutrophil CXC chemokine receptor 2, resulting in decreased ERK-mediated neutrophil migration (Laarman et al., 2012).
PMC8054439	R14005	The inhibition of ERK signaling by proteases contrasts with its observed upregulation following S. aureus attachment and invasion of host cells (Ellington et al., 2001).
PMC8054439	R14006	However, protease expression is greatest in the later phases of S. aureus growth (Shaw et al., 2004); therefore, S. aureus may exert a bi-directional impact on host ERK signaling, upregulating it via adhesin-mediated attachment and invasion during the early stages of infection, but later downregulating it through the action of secreted proteases, including V8.
PMC8054439	R16003	We did consider creating a plasmid encoding the C-terminally tagged V8 protease, but as indicated by crystal structures (described above) the C-terminal tail is absent in the native, mature secreted protein, while tagging results in the C-terminal tail being retained, so this option was ruled out.
PMC8054439	R17002	This necessitated that our experiments take place using an Aur replete strain, or with co-cultures of aur or sspA-complemented into Δprotease.
PMC8054439	R17003	Therefore, aur was also cloned into the cadmium inducible vector, transduced into the Δprotease strain and V8-deficient (ΔsspA) strains, and empty vector (EV) strains were also created (Table S6).
PMC8054439	R18000	Zymography (Figure 6A) indicated restoration of V8 and Aur activity in the Δprotease strains when complemented with sspA and aur.
PMC8054439	R18001	In the case of V8, proteolysis was only observed in the Δprotease +aur/sspA co-culture, indicating that this co-culture approach does follow the Aur-SspA activation cascade observed by others (Drapeau, 1978; Shaw et al., 2004; Nickerson et al., 2007).
PMC8054439	R18003	In addition, secreted staphylococcal Ig binding protein A (Spa) bound antibodies used in all blots, obscuring resolution of human proteins and their degradation products (Figure S4, band at ~50 kDa).
PMC8054439	R18004	Therefore, spa-deficient strains (Table S6) were generated by transduction from the appropriate mutant in the Nebraska Transposon Mutant Library (NTML) into both the Δprotease mutant and its parent strain USA300 LAC, which were then separately transduced with aur and sspA complementing plasmids or empty vectors.
PMC8054439	R18006	PrtH was only visible in secretome experiments in the spa mutant and was fully degraded in only the parent strain (LAC EV) and the Δprotease +aur/sspA conditions.
PMC8054439	R18007	A2M was notably degraded only in the Δprotease +aur/sspA condition in the Δspa experiment, but in the spa replete experiment the band corresponding to A2M at ~250 kDa is degraded in the parent strain (LAC EV), Δprotease +aur, and Δprotease +aur/sspA.
PMC8054439	R19002	As expected, V8 activity was only observed in co-cultures of Δprotease aur/sspA (as well as in the parent LAC strain).
PMC8054439	R19005	In both cases, SERPINA1 was detected in the absence of 1,10-phenanthroline, and a small amount of degradation was visible in the LAC EV and Δprotease + aur, and Δprotease +aur/sspA conditions with 1 mg culture supernatant but not in the 0.1 mg condition.
PMC8054439	R20004	The proteolysis of PrtH in the presence of supernatants is evident across all conditions, even the Δprotease strain.
PMC8054439	R20006	The activation of the clotting cascade also infers the presence of active, confounding host proteases, which can proteolyze other serum components besides those involved in coagulation (Yang et al., 2016; Weidmann et al., 2017; Bhagwat et al., 2020) and is particularly pertinent given that numerous protease inhibitors were shown here to be degraded by V8 (discussed throughout the results and discussion section), and immunoblotting indicated that secreted S. aureus proteins can also bind at least one protease inhibitor (A2M, Figure S4).
PMC8054439	R20007	The interactome is made all the more complex by the effect of S. aureus-secreted proteases on its own secretome (Kolar et al., 2013; Zheng et al., 2014; Byrum et al., 2018), with work described here utilizing protease mutants and complemented strains with host interactions that are not fully characterized.
PMC8054439	R21000	Given that the Δprotease mutant is already known to display reduced growth in serum (Kolar et al., 2013), and our N-terminomic data show a clear role for V8 in serum proteolysis, our final approach was to determine the contribution of this protease to the survival of S. aureus in human serum.
PMC8054439	R21002	The requirement for Aur in V8 activation rendered ΔsspA the only practical choice, as opposed to using Δprotease.
PMC8054439	R21005	Therefore, despite still possessing 9/10 of its secreted proteases, the loss of V8 is detrimental to the survival and proliferation of S. aureus in human serum, and arguably throughout any systemic infection.
PMC8064756	D06000	The neutrophil proteases PRTN3 (proteinase-3) and MPO (myeloperoxidase) (Figure 5) and the neutrophil-derived protein AZU1 were associated with severe disease (Supplementary file 1d), indicating that neutrophil activation and degranulation are features of severe COVID-19.
PMC8064756	R12005	Elevated neutrophil count was associated with Oncostatin-M, which regulates IL6, GCSF, and GMCSF production, and with the proteases MMP9 and defensin.

PMC8078281	F68002	Novel mouse model resistant to irreversible Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors: a tool identifying new therapeutic targets and side effects.
PMC8078281	I01000	Ibrutinib is a potent and irreversibly binding small-molecule inhibitor of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK).2 Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibition blocks the transmission of important growth and survival signals through the B-cell receptor (BCR) in CLL cells.
PMC8078281	I02001	Bruton’s tyrosine kinase is essential for C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12)- and CXCL13-dependent integrin-mediated adhesion and migration of B cells into lymph nodes.3–5
PMC8078281	I02002	Inhibition of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase by ibrutinib reduces the expression of the CXCL12 receptor C-X-C motif chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) on leukemic B cells, which in turn leads to a rapid release of CLL cells from the lymphoid organs into the peripheral blood (PB).6–8 CLL cells with low CXCR4 surface expression do not migrate back to tissue niches and are therefore deprived of survival signals.7
PMC8078281	I03000	Nonmalignant B cells that exist in the shadow of their transformed counterparts in CLL are presumably affected by ibrutinib as well, since Bruton’s tyrosine kinase is an essential enzyme in physiological B-cell development.9 Moreover, the enzymatic activity of other kinases that have a similarly aligning cysteine residue to Bruton’s tyrosine kinase is also inhibited by ibrutinib.2,10,11 Such “off-target” binding could potentially contribute to the clinical efficacy of ibrutinib, as well as to side effects.
PMC8078281	M00004	PB samples from 9 healthy donors were used as controls and PB samples from 8 patients with XLA harboring a verified mutation in Bruton’s tyrosine kinase were acquired from the hospital’s immunodeficiency unit.
PMC8078281	R06002	Moreover, only 2 of them were modestly altered in XLA as compared to pretreatment samples (Figure ​(Figure5),5), suggesting that the levels of most of these biomarkers are unrelated to Bruton’s tyrosine kinase activity in non-B cells and instead represent “off-target” effects.
PMC8078281	R12001	Because the CD5+ cells represent the B lymphocyte population most sensitive to Bruton’s tyrosine kinase deficiency, while, conversely, CLL cells are known to carry CD5, B cells in these disorders could be regarded as representing opposite ends of the spectrum.
PMC8078281	R12003	Moreover, CD5 marks both CLL and mantle cell lymphoma, which both respond to Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors, while other B cell malignancies lack, or show low levels, of this surface marker,55 suggesting that there may be a functional correlation.
PMC8078281	R13000	Bruton’s tyrosine kinase is expressed in hematopoietic cells such as B cells and myeloid cells, but not in T cells and plasma cells.56,57
PMC8078281	R14002	Second, while many other hematopoietic cells express BTK,56,57 the plasma proteins that derive from these cells seem to be essentially independent of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase.
PMC8078281	R23001	While it cannot be excluded that the disease severity, prior treatment history and the relatively low number of patients examined might have had an impact on our observations, we believe that these could serve as a starting point for more in-depth functional studies, for example, to characterize the effect of Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitors with a narrower effect on other kinases using the biomarker assay system.
PMC8088963	A00006	Six urinary EV proteins (heat‐shock protein 90, syndecan‐1, myristoylated alanine‐rich C‐kinase substrate (MARCKS), MARCKS‐related protein, tight junction protein ZO‐2, and complement decay‐accelerating factor) were quantified using SRM/MRM analysis and validated as significantly upregulated in BCa patients (P < .05).

PMC8095344	D02003	In the study conducted by [6], unstimulated whole saliva was collected by drooling method and stored in a protease inhibitor cocktail after it has been centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min, the saliva sample was also depleted of all amylase and immunoglobulin by incubating serially with antihuman amylase and protein G beads, before the levels of IL-6 was determined using ELISA, while Monea et al. used the sandwich ELISA method to assay for the levels of IL-6 in unstimulated whole saliva [18].
PMC8105904	D05000	Serpina3n is a secreted peptidase inhibitor of the serpin family,25 whose expression is induced by inflammation and nerve injury.26,27 S100A4 is a Ca-binding protein, member of the S100 family of proteins, which plays an important role in tumor progression,28 but is also overexpressed in the damaged human and rodent brain.29 We examined the expression of both markers by immunofluorescence staining in cerebellum, hippocampus, and spinal cord tissues of EAE mice.

PMC8125802	A00006	One example is the increased amount of the enzyme protein disulfide isomerase, which is clinically investigated as an antithrombotic drug target of the plant-based flavonol quercetin.

PMC8125802	D02009	Our findings that the platelet level of the 55 kDa fragment of F13A1 did not correlate with the enzymatic activity of this transglutaminase in platelets suggests that it may be a product of accelerated F13A1 inactivation in patients with lung cancer.
PMC8125802	D02011	So far, however, it has only been reported that this protease exclusively inactivates thrombin-activated F13A1.
PMC8125802	D03002	The current 2D-gel-based proteomics study showed that all acidic 83 kDa proteoforms of F13A1 had a significant positive correlation with the enzymatic activity of this transglutaminase except the most highly abundant alkaline one.

PMC8125802	R08001	The fibrin crosslinking protein F13A1 is a transglutaminase with a molecular weight of 83 kDa.
PMC8125802	R09000	Generally, F13A1 is activated by thrombin with the enzymatic removal of a short (2–37) activation peptide [36,37], which results into the 79 kDa activated F13A1 proteoform, whereas a 55 kDa fragment of F13A1 is observed to be produced after the enzymatic inactivation of activated F13A1 by further cleavage with, e.g., thrombin [38], chymase [39] and plasmin [40].
PMC8125802	R09002	For inactivation of F13A1, thrombin cuts at K514 [38], chymase at F574 [39] and plasmin at R492 [40].

PMC8127565	A00000	ATP citrate lyase (ATP citrate lyase) is involved in lipid metabolism and inflammatory response in immune cells.
PMC8127565	A00001	However, the serum level of ATP citrate lyase and its clinical relevance in sepsis is totally unknown.
PMC8127565	A02000	Higher levels of ATP citrate lyase were detected in sera of pediatric patients with sepsis than that of healthy children.
PMC8127565	A02001	The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of ATP citrate lyase for diagnosis of sepsis was 0.855 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0757–0.952), and an AUC of ATP citrate lyase for predicting PICU mortality was 0.770 (95% CI: 0.626–0.915).
PMC8127565	A02002	ATP citrate lyase levels ≤21 ng/ml on PICU admission predicted an unfavorable prognosis among patients with sepsis with a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 67.6%.
PMC8127565	A02003	Moreover, serum ATP citrate lyase levels were correlated to platelet count, IL‐18 levels, and monocyte counts in pediatric patients with sepsis, implying the potential roles of ATP citrate lyase in immunometabolic regulation in sepsis.
PMC8127565	A03000	ATP citrate lyase is firstly identified in sera of patients with sepsis.
PMC8127565	A03001	Serum ATP citrate lyase level is an additional diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in pediatric patients with sepsis.
PMC8127565	A04000	ATP citrate lyase is firstly identified in sera of patients with sepsis.
PMC8127565	A04001	Serum ATP citrate lyase level is an additional diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in pediatric patients with sepsis.
PMC8127565	D00000	To the best of our knowledge, it is the first report about serum ATP citrate lyase in patients with sepsis.
PMC8127565	D00001	serum ATP citrate lyase level was correlated to PLT count, IL‐18 levels, and monocytes count, and serum ATP citrate lyase level proved to be an additional diagnostic biomarker and a prognostic predictor.
PMC8127565	D01000	It is well‐known that ATP citrate lyase is a cytoplasmic enzyme that represents a cross‐link between glucose metabolism and fatty acid synthesis/mevalonate pathways.
PMC8127565	D02000	In this study, we demonstrated a prognostic impact of ATP citrate lyase serum concentrations on PICU admission in pediatric patients with sepsis.
PMC8127565	D02001	This study first demonstrated that serum ATP citrate lyase level could be a candidate for the prognostic value of sepsis.
PMC8127565	D02002	In particular, patients with lower ATP citrate lyase serum levels (≤21 ng/ml) had a significantly impaired prognosis compared with patients with higher ATP citrate lyase levels (>21 ng/ml).
PMC8127565	D02003	Given the important roles of ATP citrate lyase in mitochondria function and metabolic regulation,25, 26 we could further speculate that ATP citrate lyase may be implemented into established scoring systems to further improve their sensitivity and specificity, and maybe a drug target to regulate immune response via ACLY‐mediating metabolism for sepsis, just like in cancer.
PMC8127565	D03000	As a novel prognostic predictor, the correlations between serum ATP citrate lyase and other laboratory indexes give some implications for its function in sepsis.
PMC8127565	D04002	Second, the changes of serum levels of ATP citrate lyase during PICU stay and the correlation of serum ATP citrate lyase to metabolite levels like citrate or fatty acids were lacking due to the limited blood sampling.
PMC8127565	D04003	Third, how ATP citrate lyase is released into circulation is still unclear.
PMC8127565	D04004	At present, it is totally unclear which molecular mechanisms are responsible for alterations in serum ATP citrate lyase levels in sepsis.
PMC8127565	D04005	Moreover, it is still unknown if changes in serum ATP citrate lyase levels reflect an active secretion to play a functional role as “messengers” or a passive release during cell death.
PMC8127565	D04006	Nevertheless, our findings strongly support future functional and clinical analyses on the role of ATP citrate lyase in the pathophysiology of sepsis.
PMC8127565	D05000	In summary, we first identified serum ATP citrate lyase as a new diagnostic and prognostic biomarker in pediatric patients with sepsis.

PMC8127565	R00000	To evaluate the potential value of serum ATP citrate lyase as a biomarker for sepsis, we measured serum ATP citrate lyase levels at the time point of PICU admission (before therapeutic interventions) in 101 pediatric patients with sepsis and in 30 healthy controls.
PMC8127565	R01000	Serum ATP citrate lyase concentrations on PICU admission were significantly higher in patients who fulfilled sepsis criteria compared with healthy control, and the basic level of serum ATP citrate lyase in healthy control was very low (Figure ​(Figure1A).1A).
PMC8127565	R01001	Of note, lower ATP citrate lyase serum concentration appeared in non‐survivors compared with survivors (Figure ​(Figure1B).1B).
PMC8127565	R01002	The results of subgroup analysis indicated that there was no significant association between serum ATP citrate lyase levels and organ dysfunction (all p > .05; Figure S2).

PMC8127565	R02003	The correlation analyses indicated that serum ATP citrate lyase level was positively correlated to PLT count (p = .006) and the levels of IL‐18 (p = .027), as well as negatively correlated to monocytes count (p = .031) after being adjusted by PRISM III score (Table ​(Table33).
PMC8127565	R03000	To enclose the potential value of serum ATP citrate lyase in pediatric sepsis, ROC analysis was performed to assess the power of serum ATP citrate lyase in assessing the occurrence of sepsis and in predicting the outcome of sepsis.
PMC8127565	R03001	The results showed that serum ATP citrate lyase levels could be an additional biomarker for sepsis occurrence with a high value of area under ROC curve (AUC) of 0.855 (95% CI: 0.757–0.952; Figure ​Figure2A).2A).
PMC8127565	R03002	The cut‐off value of serum ATP citrate lyase level for an additional diagnosis of sepsis was 9.96 ng/ml with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 72.4%.
PMC8127565	R03003	Furthermore, serum ATP citrate lyase levels displayed high prognostic accuracy for PICU mortality with an AUC of 0.770 (95% CI: 0.626–0.915), and the sensitivity was 87.5% and the specificity was 67.6% at the cut‐off value of 21 ng/ml (Figure ​(Figure2B).2B).
PMC8127565	R03005	Furthermore, there were seven cases who died in the subgroup of 30 patients with serum ATP citrate lyase level ≤21 ng/ml, and four cases died in the subgroup of 71 patients with serum ATP citrate lyase level >21 ng/ml (Figure ​(Figure3).3).
PMC8127565	R03006	The PICU mortality was significantly higher in the subgroup of serum ATP citrate lyase level ≤21 ng/ml compared with the subgroup of serum ATP citrate lyase level >21 ng/ml (7/30 vs. 4/71; p = .009; Figure ​Figure33).
PMC8146187	A00007	In addition, proteins correlating with clinical index such as alkaline phosphatase (alkaline phosphatase) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were also detected.
PMC8146187	D02003	For instance, RARRES2 was observed to have close associations with alkaline phosphatase, which was the important clinical index of the liver for reflecting the function of the liver because it was mainly produced by liver cells32.

PMC8205096	D01000	Lysosomal pH and the lysosomal V-ATPase complex is of critical relevance to lysosomal function, since it influences a number of parameters: activation of cathepsins and other lysosomal hydrolases/proteases, as a regulator of lysosome-autophagosome fusion, as a counter-ion for lysosomal chloride channels, and as a driver of amino acid sensing to MTORC1 in the lysosome.
PMC8205096	D01001	Reciprocally, vacuolar-type H+-translocating ATPase function is regulated itself by lipid composition [52–54], MTORC1 [55], nutrient [56–58] and growth factor [59,60] signaling among others.

PMC8205096	D06002	Nevertheless, the literature exploring the relationship of vacuolar-type H+-translocating ATPase function to MTORC1-TFEB signaling presents apparent inconsistencies, likely due to different methods and interpretations of pH measurements over varying pharmacological treatments and cell types.
PMC8205096	D06004	In yeast, for example, genetic conditions that abolish the production of the phosphoinositide lipid PI(3,5)P2 lead to a reduction of vacuolar-type H+-translocating ATPase activity due to reduced V1/V0 assembly, that can be almost completely restored by the addition of glucose [53], showing that multiple signaling circuits can combine to control lysosomal physiology.

PMC8385024	D03003	Moreover, at proteome level, focal adhesion kinase signaling pathway was more activated in the MMP-2 high-group than in the MMP-2 low group as abundance of most proteins associated in focal adhesion kinase signaling showed significantly positive correlation with the abundance of MMP-2 across the CRC patients.
PMC8385024	D03004	It is plausible that activation of focal adhesion kinase signaling also increased the MMP-2 expression as focal adhesion kinase also activates the SRC-ERK signaling, and ERK induces the expression of MMP-226,51,52.
PMC8385024	D03005	focal adhesion kinase has kinase functions and transfers signals from extracellular space to nucleus via phosphorylation mediated signal cascade53, however, phosphopeptides of the direct substrate of focal adhesion kinase were detected only in a few samples of CPTAC cohort, making it difficult to determine the statistically significant level of phosphorylation.
PMC8385024	D03006	Nevertheless, based on phosphorylation status of indirect substrate of focal adhesion kinase signaling pathway, multiple kinase including SRC, mTOR and JNK exhibited the increased kinase activity score in MMP-2 high group.
PMC8385024	D04001	This demonstrates that MMP-2 activates focal adhesion kinase signaling in an activity-dependent manner.
PMC8385024	D04002	We observed an inhibition of MMP-2 activity and a reduction in focal adhesion kinase autophosphorylation (p-FAK-tyr397), an essential indicator of the integrin mediated focal adhesion kinase signaling activation54.
PMC8385024	D04003	We also observed that proteins such as ERK, PI3K, and JNK in the downstream focal adhesion kinase signaling cascade were also inactivated.
PMC8385024	D04004	focal adhesion kinase pathway is located at the central hub in various signaling pathways, controls cell motility by activating transcription factors of related genes55–57.

PMC8385024	D05003	We demonstrated that high invasiveness, featured in CRC cells with increased secretion of MMP-2, is the result of MMP-2 activation of focal adhesion kinase signaling through the CD9-integrin complex.

PMC8487586	A00001	Toceranib phosphate (TOC) is a multi-target receptor tyrosine kinase (Receptor tyrosine kinase) inhibitor that exhibits activity against members of the split kinase family of RTKs.
PMC8487586	A00002	The purpose of this study was to evaluate primary UC tumors and UC cell lines for the expression and activation of VEGFR2, PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, and KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase to assess whether dysregulation of these RTKs may contribute to the observed biological activity of TOC.
PMC8487586	A01000	Transcript for VEGFR2, PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, and KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase was detected in all UC tissue samples and UC cell lines.
PMC8487586	D00004	More specifically, inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) represents a targeted strategy to block tumor cell proliferation, invasion and survival.
PMC8487586	D00005	The purpose of the current study was to evaluate primary UC tumors and available UC cells lines for expression of Receptor tyrosine kinase transcript and activation (phosphorylation) of RTKs targeted by toceranib phosphate (TOC) to better understand the biological basis for the observed responses of this tumor to TOC.
PMC8487586	D01000	While transcript for PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, VEGFR2 and KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase was detected in all tumor samples and UC cell lines, the pattern of expression was variable.
PMC8487586	D01001	Furthermore, while mRNA was present in UC tumor tissues and UC cell lines, the presence of Receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation for these RTKs was present in only 11–33% of tumor specimens and UC cell lines suggesting that activation of these RTKs is present in only a small subset of UC cells.
PMC8487586	D01002	Importantly, the absence of Receptor tyrosine kinase pathway activation for PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, VEGFR2 and KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase in the majority of UC tumors and UC cell lines suggests that signaling through these pathways is unlikely to drive the aggressive behavior of UC cells.
PMC8487586	D02000	Of note, evidence of Receptor tyrosine kinase phosphorylation was variable in primary UC tumor samples evaluated in this study.
PMC8487586	D02005	To further dissect the potential influence of Receptor tyrosine kinase pathway activation on UC cell behavior, we profiled Receptor tyrosine kinase activation in established UC cell lines which represent a model system without the confounding influence of tumor stromal and/or immune cells.
PMC8487586	D02007	We observed that in the primary tumor samples evaluated, the profile of Receptor tyrosine kinase activation in UC cells lines was similar to that found in tumors with evidence of PDGFRα and PDGFRβ phosphorylation present in only 25% of UC cell lines evaluated.
PMC8487586	D03003	All cell proliferation assays were conducted in media containing 10% fetal bovine serum; therefore, it is possible that Receptor tyrosine kinase stimulation or activation by exogenous growth factors within the media may have contributed, in part, to the negligible effect of TOC treatment on UC cell line proliferation.
PMC8487586	D03004	These data are concordant with our Receptor tyrosine kinase profiling results which show that RTKs targeted by TOC infrequently show evidence of phosphorylation and that inhibition of these RTKs are unlikely to have a substantial activity on UC cell proliferation or clinically meaningful benefit.
PMC8487586	D04001	In light of our data demonstrating that TOC does not appear to have a significant direct impact on UC cell line proliferation this suggests that reported clinical benefit seen in UC patients receiving TOC may be due, in part to off-target effects or inhibition of Receptor tyrosine kinase activity in cells present within the tumor microenvironment.

PMC8487586	M02002	This was a pilot study with the intent to characterize the expression and phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine kinases in primary canine UC tumors and UC cell lines, so no power calculation was made.

PMC8487586	R02002	Consistent with previous studies demonstrating minimal immunohistochemical staining for KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase in UC tumor samples, we found that the expression levels of PDGFRα, PDGFRβ, and VEGFR2 transcript was higher in UC tumors and UC cell lines as compared to the relatively low basal expression of KIT proto-oncogene receptor tyrosine kinase in all samples.

PMC3374609	F51002	Bacterial flavodoxins support nitric oxide production by Bacillus subtilis nitric-oxide synthase.
PMC3374609	R04001	These unsurprisingly included large, well-conserved pathways such as the ribosome (M00178) and polymerase (M00183), but also a variety of smaller specialized modules such as sugar transport (M00207, four genes, present in staggered/high-complexity at 0.25% and detected at 0.28%) and biotin biosynthesis (M00123, four genes, present at 1.7% and detected at 1.7%).
PMC3374609	R06003	Two of these extended the categories listed above; the remainder comprised sn-Glycerol 3-phosphate transport (M00198, a membrane lipid precursor [32]), the mannose and trehalose phosphotransferase systems (M00270 and M00276), spermidine/putrescine transport (M00299), early terpenoid biosynthesis (M00364), and threonine biosynthesis (M00018), the only amino acid module to meet this prevalence threshold.
PMC3374609	R10001	Chondroitin and dermatan sulfate degradation share the greatest overlap with 3 KO families, including beta-glucuronidase (K01195).
PMC3374609	R10002	Beta-glucuronidase is prevalent in the gut, averaging 0.03% sd.
PMC3374609	R10010	This is due exclusively to the absence of the module's input enzyme, heparanase (K07964-5), a typically eukaryotic gene family implicated in tumor metastasis [47]; the healthy commensal microbiota may thus lack this activity in order to avoid undesirable inflammatory and immune response in the gut [48].
PMC3374609	R10011	Conversely, the abundances of the four gut-specific GAG degration modules were not driven by one specific gene family (Figure 5), ranging from the most abundant beta-hexosaminidase (K12373, ave.
PMC3374609	R10012	0.3% sd. 0.1%) to the low-abundance outlier L-iduronidase (K01217, ave.
PMC3374609	R11001	Enriched functions included phosphate, glutamate/aspartate, and phosphotransferase transport systems (M00222, M00230, M00276, M00277, M00287); other functions such as arginine and amino acid transport (M00229, M00237) were significantly depleted.
PMC3374609	R11005	The low number of genes involved would render its detection prone to noise; however, as described below, this module is detected very consistently only in women with vaginal pH≥4.0, and then only due to either K00536 (Enzyme Class EC 1.19.6.1, nitrogenase - flavodoxin) or, in a minority of cases, K02588 (EC 1.18.6.1, nitrogenase).
PMC3374609	R12009	Specifically, pH correlated with the abundances of N-acetylgalactosamine II phosphotransferase (M00277), proline biosynthesis (M00015), and again “nitrogen fixation” (M00175), while phosphate transport (M00222), peptide/nickel transport (M00239), and lysine biosynthesis (M00016) were associated with lower pH. Species within the Lactobacilli are known to specialize in exactly these areas of nutrient uptake and carbohydrate metabolism [55], [56], and many of these differences can be observed directly within finished genomes (e.g. lysine biosynthesis is present in L. crispatus and lacking in L. gasseri[26]).
PMC3374609	R15003	Those pathways that were consistently present tended to be so broadly defined (e.g. ko02060, phosphotransferases, or ko00030, the entirety of pentose phosphate) that they provided too coarse a view with which to observe metabolic variation and niche specialization among body sites.
PMC3374609	R16005	Likewise, pyruvate metabolism includes portions of the citric acid cycle (M00173), absent from the posterior fornix and rare in the gut and skin; pyruvate oxidation (M00307), absent from the posterior fornix and rare in the gut; and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (M00310), present only in the nares and gut.
PMC3374609	R17006	In particular, six CAZy-module pairs had significant positive or negative correlations in all seven body sites: proline biosynthesis with GH5 (cellulase) and GH18 (chitinase); 2-oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase with GH28 (galacturonases) and GH97 (α-glucosidase and α-galactosidase); and glutathione transport with GH3 (β-glucosidase) and GH18.
PMC3374615	I01000	CRISPR arrays are usually adjacent to cas genes, which encode a large and heterogeneous family of proteins with functional domains typical of nucleases, helicases, polymerases, and polynucleotide-binding proteins.

PMC3386201	D01000	Activities of both enzymes were directly associated with higher abundance of five Clostridia genera in the phylum Firmicutes, especially with Ruminococcaceae, Subdoligranulum and non-Clostridiales, largely complementing and corroborating in vitro results, such as the previously noted high prevalence of the classical gus gene and β-glucuronidase activity among Ruminococcaceae isolates.
PMC3386201	D01002	[7], [11] We found that activity levels of both enzymes had significant inverse associations with the relative abundance of Roseburia, whereas Dabek and colleagues noted that all eight Roseburia strains examined produced β-glucosidase and six of these also produced β-glucuronidase.
PMC3386201	D01003	[11] Moreover, Gloux et al found one Roseburia strain that harbored a newly discovered class of genes with β-glucuronidase (BG) activity.
PMC3386201	D01005	Enzyme activities in our study also were directly associated with the abundance of Alistipes in the phylum Bacteroidetes, which did not harbor the newly discovered BG genes, but which also has not been evaluated for in vitro production of β-glucuronidase or β-glucosidase.
PMC3386201	D01007	Further annotation, functional and metatranscriptomic approaches are clearly needed to discern whether the enzymatic levels detected in vivo correspond to a few highly active and readily inducible genes, or to more modest expression by multiple glycosidase genes acting in concert.

PMC3409016	R09002	For example, in both metagenomes enzymes of three pathways involved in sulfur oxidation were detected: the Adenosine-5’-Phosphosulfate (EC 2.7.7.4, EC 1.8.99.2), the Sulfite:Cytochrome C oxidoreductase (EC 1.8.2.1) and the Sox enzyme complex (Figure ​(Figure2).2).
PMC3409016	R11001	We identified key genes for nitrification, denitrification, nitrogen fixation and nitrate ammonification, including ammonia monooxygenase (amoA), nitrate reductase (narGnapAnasA), nitrite reductase (nirKnirS), nitric oxide reductase (nor), nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), nitrogenase (nifHnifD) and assimilatory nitrite reductase (nrfAnirAnirB) in both metagenomes (Figure ​(Figure3).3).
PMC3409016	R11006	Respiratory nitrate reductase (narG) reduces nitrate to nitrite predominantly during anaerobic growth, while the nasA assimilate nitrate during aerobic growth [53].
PMC3409016	R11012	In fact, the gene encoding for ammonia monooxygenase (amoA), a key enzyme for ammonia oxidation was highly enriched in the BP metagenome (Fisher’s exact test, q < 0.05) (Table ​(Table2).2).
PMC3409016	R12003	For example, the stand-alone arsB chemiosmotic transport protein (i.e. anion channel) is enriched in the TP biofilm (Fisher’s exact test, q < 0.05), while the BP biofilm is rich in arsA enzymes (EC 3.6.3.16) (Fisher’s exact test, q < 0.05), which transform the arsB into an arsAB ATPase complex [59].

PMC3409016	R14005	In this study we were able to detect the presence of putative membrane-associated ammonia monooxygenase in the BP biofilm.
PMC3409016	R14009	Thus, the lack of previous detection of amoA genes by Santo Domingo et al.[11] can be explained by the fact that the assay cannot detect the amoA in heterotrophic ammonia oxidizing bacteria as they were designed to amplify representatives of the autotrophic ammonia monooxygenase, for example, Nitrosomonas species [68].
PMC3409016	R15001	The reconstruction of the sulfur metabolism network showed several pathways used to oxidize the end products of sulfate reduction leading to the production of H2SO4, e.g. Sox complex, sulfide quinone oxidoreductase (sqr) and the flavocytochrome c (fccAB) in the corroded section of the pipe (Figure ​(Figure2).2).

PMC3798377	A00000	Intestinal proteases carry out a variety of functions in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract.
PMC3798377	A00001	Studies have reported that elevated enteric proteases in patients with GI disease can alter intestinal physiology, however the origin (human vs. microbial) of elevated proteases in patients with GI disease is unclear.
PMC3798377	A02000	In order to capture a wide range of fecal protease (fecal protease) activity stool samples were collected from 30 IBS patients and 24 healthy controls.
PMC3798377	A02003	fecal protease activity levels were determined using an ELISA-based method.
PMC3798377	A02004	fecal protease activity was ranked and top and bottom quartiles (n=13 per quartile) were identified as having high and low fecal protease activity, respectively.
PMC3798377	A03000	The overall diversity of the intestinal microbiota displayed significant clustering separation (p = 0.001) between samples with high vs. low fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	A03001	The Lactobacillales, Lachnospiraceae, and Streptococcaceae groups were positively associated with fecal protease activity across the entire study population, whilst the Ruminococcaceae family and an unclassified Coriobacteriales family were negatively associated with fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D00000	Although it has been known for some time that the intestinal microbiota is a significant source of protease activity in the GI tract, to date there has only been one report that correlated specific enteric bacterial taxa with fecal protease activity in the human gut [26].
PMC3798377	D00004	Our study used molecular methods to identify the enteric bacterial taxa that are associated with fecal protease activity, thus adding to the knowledge of human protease activity in the human GI tract.
PMC3798377	D01000	We found a significant difference in the overall composition of the microbiota between fecal samples with high versus low fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D01003	A significant difference between the microbiotas of high versus low fecal protease activity samples using both un-weighted and weighted analyses suggests that the difference in microbial communities between these groups is based on both dominant and low abundance bacterial taxa present in fecal samples.
PMC3798377	D01004	This finding is supported by the estimation of α-diversity measures (rarefaction) between fecal samples with high versus low fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D01005	We found that the number of observed bacterial species (based on species-level OTUs) and Shannon index of diversity were significantly lower in fecal samples with high fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D01008	Together, these findings indicate that individuals with high fecal protease activity have lower numbers and diversity of bacterial species in their intestine and harbor a microbiota that is distinct from individuals with low fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D02000	When we applied a stringent association analysis and adjusted for confounding demographic data across our entire study population between fecal protease activity and specific bacterial taxa, we found the Lactobacillales, Lachnospiraceae, and Streptococcaceae groups and an unclassified Coriobacteriales family were positively associated with fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D02002	The Streptococcaceae family is likely the driving force behind the association between the Lactobacillales order and fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D02005	Interestingly, members of the Streptococcus genus have been found to produce proteases with a broad range of functions [28-33].
PMC3798377	D04000	We also found that the Ruminococcaceae family was negatively correlated with fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D04003	Indeed, our qPCR analysis confirmed an association between F. prausnitzii and fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D04006	Additionally, we found that an unclassified Coriobacteriales family was associated with fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D04007	Given the lack of information regarding this group of bacteria, we cannot speculate on the relevance of its relationship to fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D04008	As the Ruminococcaceae family encompasses beneficial bacterial species and the Streptococcaceae family encompasses protease producers, it is tempting to speculate that a microbiota associated with low fecal protease activity is associated with a more beneficial to the host than a microbiota with high fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D05000	Unlike previous studies that observed a significant increase in fecal protease activity in IBS patients compared to healthy controls [6,10], we did not find a substantial difference in fecal protease activity between these groups in the current study.
PMC3798377	D06000	In conclusion, we report a distinction between the microbiotas within fecal samples with high and low fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D06001	The distinction between these microbiotas is likely due to the presence of low microbial diversity and the absence of bacterial taxa in fecal samples with high fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D06003	One of the strengths of our study includes the diverse source of fecal samples (i.e., from HC and certain types of IBS patients) that enable the analysis of human specimens with a broad range of fecal protease activity.
PMC3798377	D06007	Furthermore, the relative contribution of the altered microbiota in individuals with elevated fecal protease activity could be responsible for the alterations in GI physiology and the pathogenesis of certain GI diseases e.g., IBS and IBD
PMC3798377	D06009	Our study findings provide a basis for further research, including metagenomic sequencing, to investigate the role of the bacterial groups identified in our study, and the proteases they produce, with the pathogenesis of GI diseases.

PMC3798377	I00000	Proteases, or proteolytic enzymes, catalyze the breakdown of proteins by hydrolysis of peptide bonds.
PMC3798377	I00001	Compared to all other organs in the human body, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract contains the highest levels of endogenous and exogenous proteases [1].
PMC3798377	I00002	Initially the function of proteases was considered to be the breakdown of protein relevant to food digestion and intracellular protein turnover; however it was discovered that precise cleavage of proteins by proteases leads to a very subtle means of regulation [2].
PMC3798377	I00003	It is now known that proteases are involved in diverse processes such as cell-cycle progression, cell proliferation and cell death, DNA replication, tissue remodeling, coagulation, wound healing and the immune response [3].
PMC3798377	I00004	Indeed, proteolytic activity is tightly regulated to prevent any destructive activity of proteases.
PMC3798377	I01000	Protease-related genes make up approximately 2% of the mammalian genome and host proteases significantly contribute to the enzymatic content of the GI tract.
PMC3798377	I01001	However, the enteric microbiota is also a substantial source of serine, cysteine, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the intestine [4-6].
PMC3798377	R00001	These samples demonstrated a wide range of fecal protease activity (Figure 1).
PMC3798377	R00002	fecal protease activity was ranked from low to high (0-450 U Trypsin/mg protein) and divided into quartiles.
PMC3798377	R00003	The top and bottom quartiles were used to separate and further investigate samples with high (n = 13) and low (n = 13) fecal protease activity (Figure 1).
PMC3798377	R00004	The fecal protease activity data displayed a strong degree of non-normality.
PMC3798377	R00006	Accordingly, we applied a normal quantile transformation to fecal protease measurements to normalize these data.
PMC3798377	R02000	Comparison of the composition of the microbiotas between samples with high and low fecal protease activity was first carried out using a bipartite.
PMC3798377	R02001	In Figure 2 high and low fecal protease activity samples are represented by one node type and bacterial OTUs are designated as a second node type.
PMC3798377	R02002	High and low fecal protease activity nodes are connected to OTU nodes via ‘edges’.
PMC3798377	R02003	This OTU network displays a clear separation between high and low fecal protease activity samples.
PMC3798377	R02004	In the second approach Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) of UniFrac distances revealed a significant separation of the microbiotas between samples with high and low fecal protease activity based on un-weighted (p=0.001, R=0.22) and weighted (p=0.003, R=0.14) distances (Figure 3).
PMC3798377	R03000	Bacterial richness was assessed by rarefaction of OTUs found in high and low fecal protease activity samples.
PMC3798377	R03001	A significant decrease in the number of observed OTUs and the Shannon index of diversity was found in samples with high compared to low fecal protease activity (p < 0.002) (Figure 4).
PMC3798377	R04000	Family level taxa were found to display compositional differences between samples with high and low fecal protease activity (Figure 5).
PMC3798377	R04001	Correlation of bacterial groups with transformed fecal protease activity levels across the entire study population identified significant associations with specific bacterial taxa at the Family level at an FDR level of 0.1 (Table 1).
PMC3798377	R04002	The Lactobacillales, Lachnospiraceae, and Streptococcaceae groups were positively associated with fecal protease activity across the entire study population, whilst the Ruminococcaceae family and an unclassified Coriobacteriales family were negatively associated with fecal protease activity (Table 1).
PMC3798377	R05003	We found a significant (p=0.01) negative correlation of F. prausnitzii with fecal protease activity (Figure 6).
PMC3798377	R05004	Association of fecal protease activity with baseline demographic data (age, race, BMI, and IBS status) revealed no confounding individual predictors (p=0.67).

PMC3810253	R00002	A truncated form of recombinant Protein A was covalently coupled to a paramagnetic bead and was used to bind the MBD-Fc protein.
PMC3810253	R01003	We first prebound the MBD-Fc protein with paramagnetic Protein A beads, then incubated increasing amounts of MBD-Fc bound Protein A with 500 ng of input DNA, and separated bead-bound from unbound DNA fractions using a magnetic field as outlined in Figure 1.
PMC3810253	R03000	To determine the CpG methylation density required for effective binding of DNA by the MBD-Fc-protein A complex, T7 (39.9 kb) and lambda phage (48.5 kb) DNAs were cleaved with BstEII and XbaI restriction enzymes, respectively.
PMC3810253	R03002	The T7 and lambda DNA fragments were then methylated with M.HhaI (GmCGC), M.Hpa II (CmCGG) or both methyltransferases.
PMC3810253	R03004	From each pool, 250 ng of DNA was added to 40 µL of MBD-Fc-protein A beads, and the supernatant containing the unbound DNA was quantified using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel densitometry.
PMC3811629	F30002	Polymerase chain reaction primers miss half of rRNA microbial diversity.
PMC3812899	I02006	However, this study yielded limited information because the faecal samples were only analysed for changes in eight metabolites, including increased levels of amino acids and urea caused by the loss of microbial proteases and ureases, and reduced levels of acetate, butyrate and propionate generated by lactate-using bacteria.
PMC3812899	R05002	These genes were functionally categorised to have roles in protein transport and binding (potassium uptake protein, TonB-dependent receptor, nitrile hydratase propeptide microcin bacteriocin system ATP-binding cassette transporter, peptidase/ATP-binding protein), toxin production and resistance (resistance-nodulation-cell division superfamily and hydrophobe/amphiphile efflux-1 transporters), detoxification (heavy metal efflux and CzcA permeases), mobile and extrachromosomal elements (phage lambda tail tape measure protein) and protein fate determination (TolC type I secretion outer membrane protein).
PMC3812899	R10002	AB-treated samples were also characterised by a striking depletion of the translation elongation factors required for protein synthesis, such as GTPases, which facilitate the release of nascent polypeptide chains; this depletion was accentuated after treatment cessation (figure 7B).
PMC3812899	R10004	Additional key proteins, such as aerobic CobN cobaltochelatases (COG1429) essential for the biosynthesis of vitamin B12, were also found to be depleted (see table 3 in the online supplement) in samples FS-3, FS-11 and FS-14 compared with untreated samples.

PMC3827270	A00007	We functionally confirmed three novel resistance genes, including a 16S rRNA methylase conferring aminoglycoside resistance, and two tetracycline-resistance proteins nearly identical to a bifidobacterial MFS transporter (B. longum s. longum JDM301).
PMC3827270	A00008	We provide the first report to our knowledge of resistance to folate-synthesis inhibitors conferred by a predicted Nudix hydrolase (part of the folate synthesis pathway).
PMC3827270	D00005	Chloramphenicol acetyltransferases were commonly found in this cohort, as were multiple-antibiotic-resistance transcriptional regulators (MarA and its homologs SoxS and Rob).
PMC3827270	D00006	All major classes of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes were detected, as well as rRNA methyltransferases.
PMC3827270	D00007	Presumed drug-resistant dihydrofolate reductases and D-ala-D-ala ligases were present in every metagenomic library.
PMC3827270	D04000	Finally, we report trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole resistance conferred by a contig encoding a putative Nudix hydrolase, which depyrophosphorylates dihydroneopterin triphosphate in the pterin branch of the folate synthesis pathway [39].
PMC3827270	D04001	The precise resistance mechanism is unclear: Nudix hydrolase acts far upstream of dihydrofolate reductase or dihydropteroate synthase, the respective targets of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole that have previously described drug-resistant variants [47].

PMC3827270	R03001	Class A contained clusters of beta-lactamases similar to cephalosporinases previously identified in human fecal microbiota [5], and 12 unique proteins with <55% identity to any known beta-lactamase.
PMC3827270	R03002	A diverse set of predicted class A extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), including members of the TEM, SHV, CTX-M, and VEB protein families, were identified.
PMC3827270	R03004	A fifth group of beta-lactamases, CLOBOL, was comprised of proteins with high amino acid identity to the putative beta-lactamase CLOBOL_04087 from Clostridium boltae ATCC BAA-613 (GenBank Accession NZ_ABCC02000033.1).
PMC3827270	R04000	We found both pathogen-identical and novel putative beta-lactamase genes syntenic with mobile elements; these genes were often found in multiple genetic contexts, highlighting the dissemination of these genes within the gut microbiota of healthy children and adolescents.

PMC3827270	R05000	Diverse predicted aminoglycoside acetyltransferases, phosphotransferases (Fig. 3), and adenylyltransferases were identified, as were several rRNA methylases (Table S6 in File S1), which presumably confer resistance via target protection.
PMC3827270	R05001	[26] A novel transposase-associated aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (F33GE_12) was only 52% identical to any known phosphotransferase, and nucleotide BLAST of the source contig against the NCBI nt and wgs databases revealed only low identity to several Firmicutes over one-third of the contig length, suggesting a cryptic source organism for this mobilizable resistance gene at risk for dissemination.
PMC3827270	R05003	The aminoglycoside-2″ phosphotransferase Ib encoded on this C. difficile-identical sequence was 99% identical to one identified in Enterococcus faecium (GenBank Accession 3HAM_A)
PMC3827270	R06000	We also characterized a novel 16S rRNA methylase with only 42% amino acid identity to an rRNA methylase from Enterobacter cloacae strain 115–824A (GenBank Accession JN968578).
PMC3827270	R06001	This rRNA methylase generates extreme resistance to gentamicin and amikacin, with clonal growth observed at 1024 ug/mL and 2048 ug/mL respectively (Table 2); clones remained susceptible to the closely related aminocyclitol spectinomycin (MIC 32 ug/mL for both clones and controls).
PMC3827270	R10000	In tigecycline selections, only sequences encoding flavin-dependent monooxygenases (TetX1 and TetX2) were found (Table S9 in File S1) on contigs homologous with the ermF region of the tetracycline-inducible Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron CTnDOT conjugative transposon (GenBank Accession AJ311171)

PMC3827270	R12000	Contigs bearing genes that encoded D-ala-D-ala ligase were found to confer cycloserine resistance in all metagenomic libraries, possibly secondary to overexpression of plasmid-borne D-ala-D-ala ligase or D-alanine racemase by the E. coli host [36].
PMC3827270	R12001	Notably, a contig (F30CY_50) bearing a D-ala-D-ala ligase, syntenic with a RecR recombination protein and a penicillin binding protein homologous to the penicillin-insensitive PBP2b, had a nearly identical (98%) protein sequence to several group D streptococcus (Streptococcus bovis) strains (Table S12 in File S1).
PMC3827270	R12002	Other contigs with D-ala-D-ala ligases syntenic with mobilization elements (F16CY_74, F18CY_75) had identity to uncultured organisms over <70% of the total fragment length (Table S1 in File S1).
PMC3827270	R13000	Genes encoding drug-resistant dihydrofolate reductase A were present in all libraries, and were frequently associated with thymidylate synthase and occasionally with aminoglycoside adenylyltransferases, MATE efflux proteins, and macrolide-lincosamide-streptogramin ABC transporters (Tables S10, S11 in File S1).
PMC3827270	R13001	Some contigs encoding dihydrofolate reductase and a mobilization element had high nucleotide identity to known commensals (e.g. F24TRSX_31, with >98% identity to Streptococcus salivarius (GenBank Accession CP002888.1))
PMC3827270	R14000	We also identified a putative novel mechanism of antibiotic resistance: a contig encoding a Nudix hydrolase identical to one reported in Lachnospiraceae bacterium 7_1_58FAA (GenBank accession NZ_ACTW01000031) was found to confer resistance to both trimethoprim (MIC 512 ug/mL trimethoprim; control MIC 32 ug/mL) and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (MIC 32/608 ug/mL trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole; control MIC 2/32 ug/mL) in the E. coli host.

PMC3967525	R08002	Two of the most highly expressed genes in the CF transcriptome (excluding those for translation or RNA processing) were NADH oxidoreductase (K03882) and the alpha-subunit of the F-type ATPase (K02126).
PMC3967525	R09004	In our data, most reads corresponding to fermentation pathways mapped to Streptococcus spp., except for butanediol dehydrogenase, which also mapped to Rothia spp.
PMC3967525	R10006	More specifically, dihydrolipoamide (the reduced form of lipoic acid) is a cofactor of pyruvate dehydrogenase, a central enzyme for the assimilation of pyruvate into anabolic pathways or the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle.
PMC3967525	R12005	Our CF data are consistent with microbes sensing the varying availability of oxygen: the metagenomes contained anaerobic respiration response regulators (Gram-positive resED and Gram-negative arcAB), the nreBC low-oxygen sensor, and cytochrome c oxidase.
PMC3967525	R13002	Nitrate reductase was the most abundant electron acceptor gene in the metagenome and transcriptome, consistent with P. aeruginosa’s proposed ability for denitrification in the lung (21, 55).
PMC3967525	R14000	The origins of oxidized compounds that could serve as the substrates for these reductases are unknown.
PMC3967525	R14003	Fumarate is a central compound in many metabolic pathways, most notably the TCA cycle and amino acid breakdown, and is generated by succinate dehydrogenase, which was abundant in CF metagenomes and metatranscriptomes (Table S1).
PMC3967525	R15000	The terminal reductase cytochrome c oxidase was also present and expressed in the CF sputa, indicating that the CF microbes are utilizing O2 as a terminal electron acceptor (Fig. 3).
PMC3967525	R15001	Interestingly, there was a high abundance of the cbb-type cytochrome c oxidase; this enzyme is known to have a higher affinity for O2 and is preferentially used by P. aeruginosa in low oxygen (67, 68), which would be useful for aerobically respiring microbes living in the microaerobic conditions of mucus.
PMC3967525	R15002	Accordingly, cbb-type cytochrome c oxidase reads were assigned almost entirely to Pseudomonas spp., indicating that this may be a vitally important enzyme to the physiology of P. aeruginosa within the CF lung.
PMC3967525	R17002	Nitrate and ammonia have been shown to be elevated in CF lung fluids compared to non-CF controls (21, 23, 54), whereas nitric oxide and expression of human nitric oxide synthase are decreased compared to other inflammatory airway diseases (23, 71, 72).

PMC3967525	R25005	The CF lung has also been found to be elevated in copper (79), and accordingly, the sensor histidine kinase that responds to copper, cusSR, was also present and expressed (no ABC transporter for copper is available in the KEGG database) (Table S6).

PMC4139721	D07004	In the present study, genes encoding lysine decarboxylase, L-alanine dehydrogenase, biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase PLP-binding and argininosuccinate lyase exhibited a higher abundance in periodontitis that might lead to the increasing of many amino acid metabolites in periodontal patients (Barnes et al., 2009, 2011).
PMC4139721	D08005	Of particular interest to us is the gene encoding N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-4-sulfate 4-sulfohydrolase associated with C-4-S degradation because the gingival crevicular fluid content of C-4-S exhibited significant correlations with probing depth and attachment loss (Last et al., 1985; Smith et al., 1995) and C-4-S is regarded as a biomarker for bone degradation as it accounts for 94% of GAGs in alveolar bone (Waddington et al., 1989; Armitage, 2004).

PMC4139721	R10001	Of these, four genes exhibited higher relative abundances in periodontitis, including those encoding lysine decarboxylase, L-alanine dehydrogenase, biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase PLP-binding and argininosuccinate lyase, that play an indispensable role in lysine, alanine and arginine metabolism.

PMC4177395	R04007	Furthermore, all of the single copy marker genes used to assess genome completeness could be identified along with all 20 aminoacyl tRNA synthetase genes in the V. cambriense genome (Additional file 3).
PMC4177395	R09000	Several genomes encode cytochrome bd oxidase (Table 3 and Figure 2), a high oxygen affinity enzyme indicative of an ability to grow in the presence of low levels of oxygen, either by providing protection from reactive oxygen species or by using oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor during respiration [61,62].
PMC4177395	R09001	The presence of fumarate, TMAO, DMSO, nitrate, nitrite, and nitric oxide reductase genes supports the notion that members of the community are capable of using several terminal electron acceptors to respire anaerobically (Table 3, Figure 2, and Additional file 2: Figure S4).
PMC4177395	R09002	E. coli was the only organism found to encode heme-copper cytochrome oxidase genes, indicating its ability to use oxygen as an electron acceptor when present.

PMC4177395	R25000	Identification of fumarate reductase (EC: 1.3.99.1), nitrate reductase (EC: 1.7.99.4), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) reductase (EC: 1.8.5.3), suggests that fumarate, nitrate, and DMSO can all be used as terminal electron acceptors.

PMC4510187	A00002	We hypothesized that bacterial glycoside hydrolase (glycoside hydrolase) activities would be higher in a biofilm than in saliva in order to maintain metabolism in a low-sugar, high-glycoprotein environment.
PMC4510187	A00006	Overall higher glycoside hydrolase activities were observed in plaque samples, in agreement with in vitro observation.
PMC4510187	A00007	A similar pattern was observed in glycoside hydrolase activity profiles between in vitro and ex vivo data.
PMC4510187	A00008	16S rRNA gene analysis showed that plaque samples had a higher abundance of microorganisms with larger number of glycoside hydrolase gene sequences.
PMC4510187	D00000	Our results supported the first hypothesis, that higher activities of glycoside hydrolase were observed in biofilm grown in mucin medium, where the only carbon source available was complex carbohydrate.
PMC4510187	D00001	This is in agreement with previous reports in which single-species streptococci showed upregulation of the glycoside hydrolase when fermented in the absence of simple carbon sources (4, 5).
PMC4510187	D00002	The activities of four out of six enzymes peaked at 48 h, in agreement with a previous study where glycoside hydrolase of S. gordonii culture were downregulated during exponential growth phase compared to the stationary phase (4).
PMC4510187	D01000	The results agreed with the second hypothesis, in which overall higher activities of glycoside hydrolase occurred in biofilm samples than in saliva samples.
PMC4510187	D02000	Bacteria with the largest numbers of glycoside hydrolase genes are found to be most prevalent in dental plaque, and this appears to correlate with higher glycoside hydrolase activity.
PMC4510187	D02001	Among the microorganisms measured, S. gordonii and P. gingivalis harbor the largest number of glycoside hydrolase coding sequences as well as the most types of glycoside hydrolase enzymes.
PMC4510187	D02002	These organisms, along with P. intermedia and T. denticola, have genes for β-N-acetyl-hexosaminidase (GH20) and α-fucosidase (GH29).
PMC4510187	D02003	On the other hand, the most abundant GHs in S. salivarius, which accounted for the majority of salivary species, are α-amylase, lysozyme, and sucrase (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).
PMC4510187	D02004	Our results cannot determine what percentage of the cell-bound glycoside hydrolase activities in saliva was derived from bacteria; however, the enzymes in host cells are expressed at low levels and are associated primarily with intracellular metabolism, and hence they are not excreted to a significant extent.
PMC4510187	D03001	Our results are in line with previous reports in that (i) all six GHs were present in saliva of healthy adults (16, 17) and (ii) β-d-galactosidase activity was absent in salivary supernatant, while activities of β-d-hexosaminidase and sialidase were present (18).
PMC4510187	D03002	The cell-bound form of glucosaminidase activities was consistently the highest among the measured glycoside hydrolase in our samples, both in vitro and ex vivo.
PMC4510187	D03003	β-N-Ac-glucosaminidase and glucosidase have been reported as the predominant GHs in healthy human dental plaque (13).
PMC4510187	D03004	The presence of both cell-bound and secreted forms of sialidase is also in agreement with previous reports (19, 20).
PMC4510187	D04000	Both fucosidase and sialidase were present in the secreted form in saliva.
PMC4510187	D04001	Although the secreted form of sialidase has been reported, this is the first report on secreted fucosidase to the best of our knowledge.
PMC4510187	D04002	The presence of secreted forms of glycoside hydrolase, especially fucosidase and sialidase, can be explained by the modification of terminal glycoside moiety to provide a better scaffold for bacterial adhesion (21, 22).
PMC4510187	D04003	The complete lack of secreted glucosidase and galactosidase activities in saliva suggests that alternative hexose sugar production in response to external glycosides is not significantly induced.
PMC4510187	D04004	Our in vitro experiment showed the onset of glucosidase activity in mucin medium occurred at a later time point than that of the other 5 glycoside hydrolase activities.
PMC4510187	D04006	However, since the trigger for production of glycoside hydrolase is the energy requirements of the bacteria producing the enzyme, a more global benefit to the biofilm may be an example of kin discrimination (23).
PMC4510187	D04008	It is noteworthy that the secreted form of glucosidase was detected in biofilm grown in nutrient-rich sucrose medium at an earlier time point than that grown in mucin medium in our in vitro experiment.

PMC4510187	I00006	These CAZymes include glycosyltransferases and glycoside hydrolases (GHs).
PMC4510187	I00008	We speculated that the breakdown of complex, endogenous carbohydrates by glycoside hydrolase enzymes is one mechanism whereby oral microbes adapt to different carbon sources between the salivary planktonic phase, where exogenous simple sugars are generally more available, and the oral biofilm phase, where, in the absence of exogenous simple sugars, several alternative, more complex endogenous salivary glycoconjugates are the principal carbon source (8,–11).
PMC4510187	I01000	Our hypotheses for the present study were that (i) glycoside hydrolase activities are higher under conditions where the primary carbon sources are limited to complex glycan conjugates and (ii) levels of glycoside hydrolase enzymes are higher in dental plaque than in saliva due to the shift in microbial population between saliva and plaque.
PMC4510187	I02000	Here we report the glycoside hydrolase levels under conditions where carbon source availabilities include simple sugars (saliva) and those where they are limited to complex glycoconjugates (dental plaque).
PMC4510187	I02001	Our first experiment was to test if carbohydrate availability influences glycoside hydrolase activities in in vitro oral biofilm, followed by ex vivo experiments in which glycoside hydrolase activities were measured in saliva and overnight dental plaque.
PMC4510187	R00000	Overall, higher glycoside hydrolase activities were found in spent mucin medium supernatant, except for glucosidase at the 24- and 48-h time points and fucosidase at the 24-h time point (Fig. 1 and Table 1 ).
PMC4510187	R00001	These two enzymes showed continuous increases in their activities for 72 h, whereas the other four glycoside hydrolase activities peaked at 48 h. At 72 h, fucosidase, sialidase, and glucosaminidase were found to have higher activities in supernatant than in the cell-bound form (Table 1).
PMC4510187	R00002	Glucosaminidase activity was found to be the highest for both secreted and cell-bound forms among the 6 measured glycoside hydrolase, followed by galactosaminidase activity.
PMC4510187	R01005	Both cellular suspension and cell-free supernatant were assayed for glycoside hydrolase activities (Fig. 2).
PMC4510187	R02001	Secreted fucosidase, hexosaminidase, and sialidase were found in supernatant, while no activity was detected for galactosidase or glucosidase in supernatant.
PMC4510187	R02002	Secreted fucosidase activity level was equivalent with that of cell-bound form.
PMC4510187	R03005	Both cellular suspension and cell-free supernatant were assayed for glycosidase activities (Fig. 3).
PMC4510187	R04002	The ratios of the fucosidase activity of the secreted form to the cell-bound form were lower in overnight plaque than in saliva.
PMC4510187	R04003	In contrast to saliva samples, the secreted forms were observed for galactosidase and glucosidase in overnight plaque.
PMC4510187	R04004	Indeed, the highest activity observed in the secreted form was that of glucosidase, which was more than a third of the activity of its cell-bound counterpart.
PMC4510569	I00004	Alternatively, antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) can be identified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and quantified using real-time PCR, requiring specific primers for the amplification of target sequences [5].

PMC5405715	D03005	Interestingly, only AZ_3a contains a collection of close homologues of S. pneumoniae virulence genes, in particular those coding for pneumolysin Ply together with autolysin LytA, cholin-binding protein CbpG, and hyaluronidases HylA/HysA (the latter three, however, are also found in a few other strains).
PMC5405715	D06002	However, though closely related, S. oralis and S. tigurinus can be genetically and phenotypically separated by the presence or absence of gtfR and dextran, as well as IgA protease production.
PMC5405715	I03002	Furthermore, by applying S. tigurinus– and virulence factor–specific polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), the prevalence, abundance, and virulence of this species in saliva and on buccal mucosal membranes of 35 healthy adults were determined.
PMC5405715	R05006	These virulence factors include: cbpG, coding for a pneumococcal cholin binding serine protease with adhesive properties; hylA and hysA homologues, coding for hyaluronidases; the pneumolysin-gene ply, coding for a pore-forming toxin; and the autolysin-gene lytA, coding for a peptidoglycan hydrolase.
PMC5405715	R05007	On the other hand, all typical (sensu stricto) S. oralis strains differ from S. tigurinus(–like) not only in the presence of gtfR (here identified as a gtfD–gtfG homologue), but also in zmpC, encoding a zinc-metalloproteinase involved in neutrophil extravasation, inflammation, and tissue remodeling, and in possessing iga encoding an immunoglobulin A1 protease, both typically found in S. pneumoniae.
PMC5405715	R07001	To confirm that gftR-positive strains actually do produce dextran by glycosyltransferase activity, a Mitis Salivarius Agar or Columbia Blood Agar medium was enriched with 5% sucrose.
PMC5410709	D12006	The posterior insula was also associated with abundance of a subunit of butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA-transferase, an enzyme used by intestinal bacteria such as Faecalibacterium in the final step of butyrate synthesis [73, 74].
PMC5410709	D12007	Butyrate has histone deacetylase activity and signals through GRP43 and GRP109a (expressed by enterochromaffin cells, vagal afferents, and microglia), all potential mechanisms by which it could influence brain function or structure [75].

PMC5410709	R22008	Of these, we focused on two metagenes enriched in IBS1 that are involved in neurotransmitter metabolism—4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase, which degrades γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), and glutamate dehydrogenase, which mediates glutamate synthesis/breakdown—and on two metagenes enriched in IBS1 that are involved in short chain fatty acid metabolism—acetate co-A transferase subunit B, which mediates the final step of butyrate synthesis, and propionate catabolism operon regulatory protein, which regulates an operon of propionate catabolism genes (Fig. 5a).
PMC5410709	R22010	This highlighted a prominent role for one particular taxon, an unclassified Peptostreptococcaceae, which had a trend toward significant correlation (p = .058) with the right inferior segment of the circular sulcus though it fell short of significance as compared to the metagene encoding 4-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (p = .008) (Fig. 5b).

PMC5433236	A01000	In order to examine the TMA-forming potential of microbial communities, we established databases for the key genes of the main TMA-synthesis pathways, encoding choline TMA-lyase (cutC) and carnitine oxygenase (carnitine oxygenase), using a multi-level screening approach on 67,134 genomes revealing 1107 and 6738 candidates to exhibit cutC and carnitine oxygenase, respectively.
PMC5433236	D01002	[6] and carnitine oxygenase [7] were previously described.
PMC5433236	D01004	However, the yeaW gene displays close sequence identity (74%) to the carnitine oxygenase model sequence from A. baumannii and is arranged in similar operons that additionally encode a reductase (yeaX and cntB, respectively) as well as a betaine/carnitine/choline transporter, and for both enzymes, promiscuity to transform carnitine and butyrobetaine at similar rates was shown (yeaW/X was reported to act on choline and to a lesser extent on betaine as well).

PMC5433236	D02005	Nevertheless, some sequences comprised in our databases are not expected to be amplified, as the carnitine oxygenase forward primer does not match a few Betaproteobacteria, and in the case of cutC, a few sequences observed in Streptococcus show ≥2 mismatches with the reverse primer.
PMC5433236	D05000	TMA formation via carnitine oxygenase represents a distinctive branch of TMA synthesis where, next to the enzyme’s distinct substrate spectrum compared with the choline TMA-lyase, ecophysiologic features of its key player, E. coli, are substantially different to those of the major cutC-exhibiting taxa.
PMC5433236	D05003	In fact, results of the two pathways did not correlate, which is highlighted by two samples derived from the HMP dataset that display exceptionally high amounts of carnitine oxygenase, but only minute cutC abundances (Fig. 4).

PMC5433236	M00000	Databases for the key genes cutC and carnitine oxygenase were built using a multiparametric approach similar to that previously described for butyrate producers [16].
PMC5433236	M00002	cutC, ACL49259, ABB40076, EDU36695, EEU12078, EFJ62362, EEW38822, EEI47333; carnitine oxygenase, EFF74816, EGJ58898, EEW98385, EHL80614, EFK52065, EEW40126, EHL93080, EGQ26304) were aligned in Clustal Omega [17] and used to construct hidden Markov models (HMM) on full-length proteins via hmmbuild (default mode, HMMER 3.1b1, hmmer.org).
PMC5433236	M00005	The top 3000 and 10,000 protein sequences (based on HMM score) from cutC and carnitine oxygenase searches, respectively, were collapsed (function derep [18]) and aligned to the HMM models (hmmalign in default mode).
PMC5433236	M00009	Finally, genomes were screened for cutD and cntB (hmmsearch) using HMMs that were built (hmmbuild, hmmalign cycles as described above) from protein sequences that derived from the same genomes that contain the cutC/cntA seed sequences used above (to obtain seed sequences, reference sequences of cutD (ACL49260) and cntB (EEX03957) were BLASTED (blastp, v. 2.2.28+) against respective genomes; all seed sequences were in direct synteny (based on locus tag) with respective partner genes cutC and carnitine oxygenase; no cntB for Sporosarcina newyorkensis was found).
PMC5433236	M00011	Subsequently, their synteny with respective partner genes cutC and carnitine oxygenase was determined where genes separated by ≤10 genes (based on locus tag) were considered as syntenous.
PMC5433236	M00013	For carnitine oxygenase, phylogeny was applied as an additional filter to the HMM score and 43 sequences (34 unique proteins; including S. newyorkensis) that displayed HMM similarities above the set cutoff were omitted yielding 6738 genomes that exhibit 6772 candidate genes (491 unique proteins).
PMC5433236	M02001	We modified previously published primers [9] in order to amplify cutC, while primers targeting carnitine oxygenase were designed in-house (Table 1).
PMC5433236	M02006	An initial 95 °C step for 15 min was followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 45 s; annealing at 57 and 53 °C for cutC and carnitine oxygenase, respectively, for 45 s; and an extension step at 72 °C for 45 s deploying final primer concentrations of 2.5 and 0.75 μM for cutC and carnitine oxygenase, respectively.
PMC5433236	M02009	aestuarii (DSM 17919) was used for cutC quantifications, whereas E. coli K12 (DSM 10517) DNA served as the standard for carnitine oxygenase. Results are expressed as averages of three independent experiments, normalized to the total 16S rRNA gene copies from each sample using previously described primers [22] applying an annealing temperature of 55 °C.
PMC5433236	M03002	The genes cutC and carnitine oxygenase were amplified using the primers and amplification conditions as described above for qPCR (applying only 20 cycles).
PMC5433236	M03004	The PCR products were purified again (PureLink PCR Purification Kit; Invitrogen, Darmstadt, Germany) and subjected to a third amplification step that added the two indices and Illumina adapters to amplicons using PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Shigu, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PMC5433236	M03007	Amplicons were separated by gel electrophoresis, and the appropriate size was excised (cutC ~480, carnitine oxygenase ~460) and extracted with the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
PMC5433236	M04001	The reference sets for each gene contained all unique sequences considered as cutC and carnitine oxygenase genes, respectively, as well as the 300 top-scoring unique protein sequences below the set HMM thresholds representing distinct sequences (see the “Constructing the databases” and “Results” sections; the 34 sequences derived from Bacilli located above the threshold though not considered as true carnitine oxygenase were included as well) as previously performed for butyrate producers [24].
PMC5433236	M04004	On average, 98.2% (cutC) and 92.5% (carnitine oxygenase) of all merged sequences passed these initial steps resulting in a mean of 40,915 ± 12,376 cutC sequences per sample (from 23,696 to 71,952) and 42,079 ± 7746 carnitine oxygenase sequences (from 28,471 to 52,687) derived from 50 and 12 samples, respectively.
PMC5433236	M04005	For carnitine oxygenase, sample 3 was omitted as >99% of obtained sequences (from 13,095) failed FrameBot analysis (this sample was also on the borderline of detection in qPCR and produced only a faint band during PCR amplification).
PMC5433236	M05001	As for the amplicon analysis above, the reference set of each gene additionally included sequences that were below the set HMM threshold (500 top-scoring unique nucleotide sequences; for cutD and cntB, the threshold was defined by the lowest scoring gene that was syntenous with its partner gene; sequences derived from Bacilli located above the threshold though not considered as true carnitine oxygenase were included as well).
PMC5433236	M06003	Amplification was performed with the PrimeSTAR HS DNA Polymerase (Takara, Otsu, Shigu, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PMC5433236	R00001	Comprehensive databases for cutC and carnitine oxygenase were established applying a multi-level screening approach on 67,134 genomes provided by the Pathosystems Resource Integration Center (PATRIC).
PMC5433236	R00003	All genes comprised in this database will be referred to as carnitine oxygenase throughout the study (see also the “Discussion” section).
PMC5433236	R01001	Additionally, synteny with the associated activator gene (cutD) as well as the reductase (cntB) that were both shown to be essential for TMA production in the corresponding pathways was investigated.
PMC5433236	R02000	Putative carnitine oxygenase genes were identified in 6738 genomes (491 dereplicated protein sequences) where the majority was observed in Proteobacteria, especially Gammaproteobacteria (mostly derived from Escherichia and Acinetobacter), and some entries belonging to Betaproteobacteria and Epsilonproteobacteria (Fig. 1b, Additional file 1B, Additional file 2B).
PMC5433236	R02003	Specifically, 34 lower-scoring sequences from Bacilli are neither in close phylogenetic relation to the top-scoring sequences nor do they exhibit syntenic cntB sequences and were, hence, not considered as true carnitine oxygenase (see also Additional file 1D).
PMC5433236	R02005	Revealed candidates exhibit carnitine oxygenase as a single copy gene, except for 31 genomes, mainly A. baumannii and E. coli strains, where more than one target was detected.
PMC5433236	R02006	However, the majority of those sequences were identical to other carnitine oxygenase genes in the respective genomes, and only two candidates (Klebsiella pneumoniae BIDMC 18C and Cupriavidus taiwanensis STM 6070) exhibited two non-identical carnitine oxygenase sequences.
PMC5433236	R03000	Gene-targeted assays for cutC and carnitine oxygenase were developed in order to determine the potential of the gut microbiota to produce TMA and to characterize the composition of this functional community in detail.
PMC5433236	R03001	In silico analysis on coverage of developed primers suggested that a broad range of cutC and carnitine oxygenase gene sequences are targeted, namely 93 and 96% of all unique cutC and carnitine oxygenase genes, respectively (allowing for one mismatch in each primer).
PMC5433236	R04002	CntA was quantified in 13 samples displaying large abundance differences ranging from 0.03 to 2.17% of bacteria possessing carnitine oxygenase, with only three samples displaying an abundance ≥0.5%.
PMC5433236	R04005	In the carnitine oxygenase qPCR, two samples (10 and 19) showed a single unspecific band (sequencing confirmed them as non-target (data not shown)) and samples were, hence, not considered as positive for the gene; one sample displayed two bands.
PMC5433236	R04006	The qPCR on one third diluted samples indicated quantities of 40.6% ± 12.2% and 39.9% ± 22.2% of undiluted samples for cutC and carnitine oxygenase (five samples were on the borderline of detection), respectively, evidencing that the PCR mixtures were devoid of any interfering ingredients.
PMC5433236	R06000	In contrast, all carnitine oxygenase sequences obtained were similar to those previously observed in Gammaproteobacteria, in particular from Escherichia/Shigella (Fig. 2c); closest match analysis revealed 98.1% being closely related to sequences from E. coli (data not shown).
PMC5433236	R06001	A few communities additionally contained carnitine oxygenase amplicons similar to those previously detected in Citrobacter and Klebsiella.
PMC5433236	R09005	In contrast, reads indicating the presence of cntA/B were nearly identical to references (99.6% ± 1.1% and 99.8% ± 0.8% for carnitine oxygenase and cntB, respectively) and predominantly related to Gammaproteobacteria, in particular to Escherichia/Shigella and Klebsiella.
PMC5433236	R10001	Our results indicated increased abundances of bacteria exhibiting the potential to produce TMA (by about a factor of 2) in the patient group where the abundances of key genes of both pathways were elevated (median values of 0.39 and 0.11% (patient group) versus 0.22 and 0% (controls) for cutC and carnitine oxygenase, respectively, as a percentage of bacteria calculated to exhibit the genes) (Additional file 8).
PMC5433236	R12009	Overall, strains are predicted to contain 101 ± 79 glycoside hydrolases (GHs), 41 ± 13 glycosyltransferases (GTs), 25 ± 17 carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs), 26 ± 13 carbohydrate esterases (CEs), and 4 ± 4 polysaccharide lyases (PLs).

PMC5476646	R14000	PFL produces acetyl-CoA and formate from pyruvate and coenzyme-A. PFL requires a ‘pyruvate formate-lyase activase’ and co-occurs with a replacement part, an ‘autonomous glycyl radical cofactor’, both of which were present in the two genomes.

PMC6024637	D00003	A recent study of mice showed that intraperitoneal butyrate administration reduced persistent lung inflammation during Klebsiella pneumoniae infection, leading to the suggestion that butyrate restores interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels in the lung by inhibiting histone deacetylase.12 Anti-inflammatory properties have been described in the intestine, where butyrate through the same IL-10-dependent mechanism was associated with heightened tolerance of macrophages toward the residing microbiota.11 Finally, as butyrate and butyrate-producing bacteria have been associated with promotion of T-regulatory cells and reduced incidence of graft-versus-host disease, a decrease of butyrate-producing bacteria might be associated with increased graft-versus-host disease and increased exposure to immunosuppressive agents such as steroids, which is a known risk factor for LRTI.24,25

PMC6146992	I00010	Generally, nonoxidative aromatic acid decarboxylases, such gallate decarboxylase, are encoded by a 3-gene operon that encodes the 3 subunits of decarboxylases (B, C, and D subunits) (9).
PMC6146992	I00012	Although LpdC is the only protein responsible for the catalytic activity in vitro, LpdB is also essential for decarboxylase activity in vivo (7).
PMC6146992	I00013	The L. plantarum gallate decarboxylase was genetically identified and characterized (7).
PMC6146992	I00014	Genes similar to L. plantarum gallate decarboxylase genes were found in other food-related lactic acid bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus brevis, and Oenococcus oeni, among others.
PMC6146992	I00015	Moreover, the presence of decarboxylase genes was associated with gallate decarboxylation and pyrogallol production (7).
PMC6146992	I02001	More specifically, optimized PCR primers for amplification of the C catalytic subunit of the gallate decarboxylase gene (lpdC) were designed to detect the presence of decarboxylases involved in gallate metabolism in the human gut (HTS-lpdC method).
PMC6146992	I02002	HTS analysis revealed the dominant and subdominant genera and species with potential gallate decarboxylase activities.
PMC6146992	I02003	The presence of functional gallate decarboxylase activity in the identified species demonstrated the usefulness of the proposed HTS method.
PMC6146992	R00001	Food gallotannins are hydrolyzed to gallic acid by an esterase enzyme (tannase), and the gallic acid formed is decarboxylated to pyrogallol by the action of gallate decarboxylase (8, 12); these enzymes have recently been described for L. plantarum WCFS1 (7, 13, 14).
PMC6146992	R00002	Among lactic acid bacteria, L. plantarum is the prototypical species possessing tannase activity.
PMC6146992	R01001	To examine the abundance and conservation of gallate decarboxylase proteins in the genus Lactobacillus, a comparative analysis was used to identify enzymes homologous to the catalytic C subunit, LpdC. Amino acid sequences homologous to the functional LpdC from L. plantarum WCFS1 (7) were identified in type strains of 28 species in the genus Lactobacillus.
PMC6146992	R01002	Additionally, a comparative analysis to identify enzymes homologous to tannase was performed (Fig. 1).
PMC6146992	R01003	The analysis clearly revealed the extended presence and conservation of LpdC among lactobacilli, with >70% identity, in contrast to the scarcity of the tannase enzyme.
PMC6146992	R01004	These results are in agreement with previous studies in which tannase (12, 16) or gallate decarboxylase (7) activity among lactic acid bacteria was analyzed.
PMC6146992	R01005	Given that the latter study also revealed that, across the lactic acid bacteria assayed, gallate decarboxylase activity corresponded to the presence of the lpdC gene (7), we selected this gene to study the distribution and abundance of dietary gallate metabolism in the human gut microbiota.
PMC6146992	R03004	Phylogenetic assignment of HTS data allowed the successful allocation of 367 sequences at the species level (with an average of 127 species per sample) using Bowtie 2 (21), with a maximum of 1 mismatch in every read against a nucleotide database of 40,552 sequences for the 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase (UbiD) gene downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) website.
PMC6146992	R05004	To our knowledge, no other human gut bacterial species with gallate decarboxylase activity have been described so far.
PMC6146992	R06001	2C and ​and3,3, gallate decarboxylase genes were identified in gut microbiota samples that were homologous to genes present in the genomes of Hungatella hathewayi DSM 13479, Erysipelotrichaceae bacterium 3_1_53, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047, Actinomyces glycerinitolerans, Anaerostipes hadrus DSM 3319, Enterococcus raffinosus ATCC 49464, Pediococcus ethanolidurans DSM 22301, Klebsiella michiganensis KCTC 1686
PMC6146992	R07002	phyla were grown in the presence of gallic acid (3 mM) to detect functional gallate decarboxylase activity, as predicted by the HTS-lpdC method.
PMC6146992	R09001	The gallate decarboxylase C subunit from L. plantarum WCFS1 (LpdC) is erroneously annotated as 3-octaprenyl-4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase (UbiD) (7).
PMC6146992	R09002	In gallate decarboxylases, ubiD-like genes are located within operons that encode partner proteins that are required for decarboxylation (7).
PMC6146992	R09004	To date, only in the genome of L. plantarum has it been noted that the genes encoding gallate decarboxylase are not clustered.
PMC6146992	R09005	In this instance, the gene encoding the C subunit, lpdC or lp_2945, is located close to the tannase-encoding gene (tanLp1 or lp_2956).
PMC6146992	R09008	Furthermore, in the species in which the gene encoding the B subunit is clustered together with the C subunit determinant, this study revealed the existence of different gene organizations among these decarboxylases, i.e., a minority BC gene arrangement (such as in H. hathewayi, an Erysipelotrichaceae species, and Enterobacter cloacae) or a widely represented CB arrangement (in Enterococcus raffinosus, P. ethanolidurans, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, K. michiganensis, C. butyricum, and S. gallolyticus, among others) (Fig. 3).
PMC6146992	R09010	As shown in Fig. 3, some of the human gut microbiota species containing gallate decarboxylase genes also contain a tannase-encoding gene in the same region of the genome (as observed in C. butyricum, A. tropicalis, and S. gallolyticus).
PMC6146992	R09011	Similar to findings for Lactobacillus species, gallate decarboxylase-encoding genes were more common than the corresponding esterase (tannase) activity in the athlete gut microbiota samples.
PMC6146992	R09012	The presence of gallate decarboxylase but not tannase activity in some bacteria could suggest a cooperative process among commensal bacteria in dietary tannin metabolism.
PMC6146992	R09013	In addition, in the human gut microbiota, it could be imagined that other bacterial species could possess appropriate mechanisms to further degrade the pyrogallol produced by these gallate decarboxylases.
PMC6146992	R11004	The results clearly show the successful use of the HTS-lpdC method to identify functional gallate decarboxylases in complex microbial communities and the subsequent use of this gene in a phylogenetic approach to investigate the gut microbiome according to activities involved in the metabolism of a relevant dietary component.
PMC6146992	R11009	In this regard, the results shown in this work indicate that gallate decarboxylase activity, which is key for metabolism of the gallates present in plant-derived foods, is present in members of the main genera in the human gut, and this feature could be an advantage for surviving in this environment.

PMC6266421	D05003	A virus enters the host cell by binding to receptors that contain SA in the cell membrane; the release of IAV from the cell membrane, in turn, requires hydrolysis of the SA linkage by the neuraminidase.1 Interestingly, mucins seem to play a protective role against influenza virus infection in mice overexpressing Muc5ac.36 Severe disease by influenza virus might be prevented by the presence of great amounts of mucins on the respiratory tract.

PMC6375204	A02003	Analysis of the carboxyl terminal residues of these peptides indicated that neutrophil elastase and cathepsin G were responsible for their generation, and accordingly, these patients had higher levels of proteolytic activity from these enzymes in their sputum.
PMC6375204	D02003	This cleavage pattern was described previously by Schilling and Overall [25] when human neutrophil elastase (neutrophil elastase) and cathepsin G (CG) were incubated with a cellular extract from human embryonic kidney cells.
PMC6375204	D02004	neutrophil elastase had a preference for cleavage between Val-Ser and Val-Gly bonds while CG had a preference for Phe-Gly, Phe-Ser, Met-Gly, and Met-Ser.
PMC6375204	D02005	These assays indicated that the peptides detected in the mass spectrometry data were being produced by these neutrophil proteases.
PMC6375204	D02006	Accordingly, neutrophil proteins (including neutrophil elastase itself) were found to be more abundant in the metabolome of patients with reduced lung function enriched in peptides.
PMC6375204	D02007	We therefore anticipated that there would be a concomitant increase in protease activity in these same patient samples, and our fluorescent reporter substrates containing P1-Val and P1-Phe confirmed this, showing abundant neutrophil elastase and CG activity in sputum from patients with reduced lung function.
PMC6375204	D02008	neutrophil elastase has been shown to be highly active in CF lungs and associated with lung function decline [26, 27].
PMC6375204	D02013	P. aeruginosa also produces proteases that may contribute to lung proteolysis [29]; however, conditioned media from this bacterium did not have enzymes that could cleave the fluorescent neutrophil elastase substrate.
PMC6375204	D02014	In summary, our data shows that in patients with more severe lung disease, neutrophil proteases degrade host proteins into peptides and amino acids and these metabolites can be found in CF lung mucus.
PMC6375204	D03006	The action of neutrophil proteases could contribute to shaping the niche space that P. aeruginosa comes to dominate in a severely diseased CF lung by providing its preferred carbon source.
PMC6375204	D06001	We hypothesize that the CF lung becomes a favored environment for persistence of P. aeruginosa in part because this bacterium promotes recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their proteases generate peptides and amino acids that are a favored carbon source of the pathogen [30–33, 38].

PMC6483181	R04000	These disruption steps were followed by an additional digestion step with Proteinase K, a broad-spectrum serine protease, to remove any protein contamination and inactivate any remaining DNAase activity prior to cell and nuclear lysis.
PMC6483181	R04001	We tested a range of proteinase concentrations; while inclusion of the enzyme was important in enhancing DNA extraction efficiency, varying the proteinase concentration had much less effect.

PMC6593728	I01001	As one of the most virulent pathogenicity islands genes, CagA is able to perturb multiple host signaling pathways by acting as a hub or extrinsic scaffold protein, in turn potentiating malignant transformation.9 CagA can interact with multiple cell components and activate multiple signaling molecules downstream of receptor tyrosine kinase growth factors, therefore causing a set of complex cellular alterations, for example, enhanced proliferation and attenuated apoptosis, changes in epithelial cell morphology and polarity, and prevention of the assembly of apical junctions.9 A serologic response to CagA in H pylori‐infected patients was found to be strongly associated with peptic ulceration.10 Oncogenic potential of CagA has been proved in animal experiments.11, 12 People infected by cagA ‐positive H pylori strains have a higher risk of developing gastric carcinoma compared to those infected with cagA‐negative strins.13 CagA‐positive H pylori strains also participate in the inflammatory response, through the production of certain cytokines such as IL‐1β and IL‐8, and activation of NF‐κB.14 Thus, infection of CagA+ H pylori strains can alter both the local and systematic environments, which might consequently influence the local and distant microbiota in the host.
PMC6593728	R00000	It was shown that pyrosequencing method detectedH pylori sequences in about 60% of samples that were H pylori negative by a combination of conventional testing (histology, rapid urease test, and culture),24 which emphasizes the use of NGS as a more sensitive method for determining H pylori infection.

PMC6593792	I01002	In the intestinal mucosa, 5‐ASA is acetylated to its inactive metabolite N‐acetyl‐5‐ASA (Ac‐5‐ASA), mainly by the enzyme N‐acetyl‐transferase 1 (NAT1), and to a small degree by N‐acetyl‐transferase 2 (NAT2).8, 9 Orally administered unbound 5‐ASA is absorbed and inactivated in the small intestinal mucosa and in the liver, thus only small amounts 5‐ASA will reach the colonic mucosa.3, 10 Therefore, several pharmaceutical delivery systems have been developed to transport orally administered 5‐ASA to the colon.
PMC6593792	I03003	5‐ASA has previously also been reported to affect intestinal bacteria, by inhibiting growth of anaerobic strains, reducing bacterial invasiveness and total faecal bacterial abundance,29, 30, 31 as well as reducing bacterial adherent biofilm thickness and Escherichia and Shigella abundances in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).21, 32 Results from a recent study also suggest that 5‐ASA acts as a polyP‐kinase inhibitor, thereby decreasing some bacteria's ability to colonise and increase their susceptibility to oxidative stress.33

PMC6765283	R06001	ACT75_RS08345, a putative molybdenum cofactor guanylyltransferase, was not essential in monoinfection but became essential in coinfection with Actinomyces oris.
PMC6765283	R06004	Second, we compared our Tn-seq data to a previous analysis of an ATP synthase mutant in monoinfection and coinfection with Streptococcus gordonii (19).
PMC6765283	R09009	Among these were cydA and cydB, which encode components of the cytochrome bd complex, the sole aerobic respiratory oxidase in A. actinomycetemcomitans.
PMC6765283	R09011	Finally, genes encoding the C and D subunits of the NADH:ubiquinone reductase [Na(+)-transporting], which is involved in respiratory metabolism, were core essential genes.
PMC6765283	R09012	In addition, 3 genes encoding components of the spermidine/putrescine ABC transporter and 3 genes encoding proteins involved in the Tol-Pal system were always essential in coinfection.
PMC6765283	R13002	The 4 additional components of the NADH:ubiquinone reductase [Na(+)-transporting] were accessory essential genes required in the majority of conditions.
PMC6765283	R13003	Furthermore, in addition to the 1 component of the FOF1 ATP synthase that was a core essential gene, genes encoding 6 additional components of the ATP synthase were accessory essential genes.
PMC6765283	R13004	A. actinomycetemcomitans required all 6 additional ATP synthase genes for fitness in coinfection with A. israelii, A. oris, B. cenocepacia, Enterococcus faecalis, F. nucleatum, Parvimonas micra, Prevotella intermedia, S. pyogenes, and Streptococcus sanguinis, as well as in monoinfection.
PMC6765283	R13005	In contrast, A. actinomycetemcomitans required no additional genes encoding the ATP synthase in coinfection with S. cerevisiae, and only 2 genes with Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae.
PMC6765283	R13008	Finally, the gene encoding ArcA, a regulator activated in anaerobic conditions, was essential with 13 coinfection microbes that range from obligate aerobes to obligate anaerobes, and the gene encoding superoxide dismutase was essential in 11 of 26 conditions, indicating increased oxygen stress during coinfection with some microbes.
PMC6765283	R16004	In addition, a gene annotated to encode a toxin-activating lysine-acyltransferase was only essential in monoinfection and in coinfection with Filifactor alocis.
PMC6765283	R16005	The putative product of this gene, LtxC, is an acetyltransferase thought to activate the A. actinomycetemcomitans virulence factor RTX toxin, leukotoxin (LtxA) (36).
PMC6765283	R17001	Compared to monoinfection, many of the genetic requirements alleviated across these 3 conditions include: Genes encoding the Flp pilus, which mediates adhesion; genes encoding ATP synthase subunits; and genes encoding proteins involved in deoxyribose synthesis.
PMC6765283	R17002	Therefore, adhesion and ATP synthase are not as critical for A. actinomycetemcomitans survival in the presence of these microbes in the murine abscess model, and A. actinomycetemcomitans has a reduced need to synthesize DNA building blocks.
PMC6765283	R18003	For example, 2 genes encoding subunits of pyruvate dehydrogenase are essential in over 18 coinfection conditions.
PMC6765283	R18004	It is notable that the only coinfection condition where neither identified component of pyruvate dehydrogenase becomes essential is coinfection with B. cenocepacia.
PMC6765283	R18006	In addition, tatA and tatC were coinfection-specific essential genes and essential in 15 and 14 conditions, respectively, indicating that the twin-arginine translocase is important in many coinfections.
PMC6765283	R19006	A. actinomycetemcomitans carbon metabolism is likely also altered in the presence of these 3 strains, as a number of genes involved in the TCA cycle and genes encoding a 1-phosphofructokinase and subunits of mannose and fructose PTS transporters are induced CoDE genes in these conditions.

PMC7019425	R09000	The GNB/LNB transporter was first isolated and identified to be responsible for the uptake of LNB that is extracellularly liberated from LNT by lacto-N-biosidase (LnbB from B. bifidum and LnbX from B. longum)
PMC7019425	R09001	[43,44] and for the uptake of GNB that is liberated from mucin O-glycans by endo-α-N-acetylgalactosaminidase [63].
PMC7019425	R17001	[32,48,58,67,68,70], GNB/LNB-BP (GltA), LNnT-BP (NahS), and the intracellular enzymes required for degrading them (GNB/LNB phosphorylase, LNT β-1,3-galactosidase, two β-1,4-galactosidases (LacZ2/6), and one β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NahA)) are highly conserved (Figure 2).
PMC7019425	R17002	B. breve commonly possesses an intracellular GH95 α-l-fucosidase, albeit that the prevalence of FL1-BP (4% occurrence) and FL2-BP (8% occurrence) is remarkably low.
PMC7019425	R19000	Extracellular GH136 lacto-N-biosidase (LnbX) is detected for 38% of B. longum genomes (151 examined) (Figure 2).
PMC7019425	R19001	LnbX-positive strains use GNB/LNB-BP (GltA) for LNB uptake and GNB/LNB phosphorylase (LNB phosphorylase) for subsequent intracellular phosphorolysis, while LnbX-negative strains use LNT β-1,3-galactosidase for hydrolysis of LNT inside the cells.
PMC7019425	R19002	GltA, LNB phosphorylase, GH42 LNT β-1,3-galactosidase, GH2 β-1,4-galactosidase (Bga2A homolog), and GH20 β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (Blon_0732 homolog) are highly conserved in B. longum, which is in agreement with the fact that this species commonly uses LNB and LNT [32,58,65,67].
PMC7019425	R19003	Consistent with the observation that B. longum strains that are capable of utilizing fucosylated HMOs are rare, we found that the prevalence of FL2-BP (3% occurrence) and α-l-fucosidases (≤3%) was quite low.
PMC7019425	R21001	About half of the strains of those examined for this species were capable of assimilating LNB, as mentioned above [67], but lacked the GNB/LNB phosphorylase gene homolog.
PMC7019425	R21003	The FL2-BP (13%) and GH95 α-l-fucosidase (13%) homologs were sporadically detected, which is consistent with the report that several strains of this species utilize 2′-FL, 3-FL, and LDFT mixture as the carbon source [12].
PMC7019425	R24002	The data mining analysis revealed that the abundances of the extracellular glycosidase genes are indistinguishable in between the fecal DNAs obtained from formula-fed infants and breast-fed infants (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S5).
PMC7019425	R31003	In addition, the growth stimulatory effect of B. bifidum on other Bifidobacterium species observed for HMO-supplemented fecal cultures disappeared when fuconojirimycin, a potent fucosidase inhibitor (both for GH29 and GH95), was added to the media [57,66].

Common sequence variants in the glucokinase (glucokinase) promoter4–6, and around genes encoding the islet specific glucose-6-phosphatase (G6PC2)5,6 and the glucokinase regulatory protein (GCKR)7–9 have each been associated with individual variation in FG levels, but have, at best, weak effects on T2D risk8,10.

PMC2745176	D01015	While its catalytic activity is hardly related to homocysteine, MUT has frequently been associated with homocysteine metabolism because it is one of three vitamin B12 dependant enzymes, along with methionine synthase and leucine aminomutase 50.
PMC2745176	D01016	Moreover, based on the observation that patients with vitamin B12 deficiency but high blood folate have higher plasma methylmalonic acid concentration (than low vitamin B12, low folate patients), it has been proposed that the enzymatic activity of methionine synthase interferes with the activity of methylmalonyl-Coa mutase through diversion of vitamin B12 from the mitochondrion to the cytosol 51.

PMC2860887	R00004	Several Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase SNPs showed modest evidence of association (best P = 2.7 × 10−4 for rs13306561).
PMC2860887	R00005	However, the widely studied Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T variant (rs1801133) was not directly tested as part of the genome-wide panel, and the imputation quality score did not meet the minimum requirement for inclusion in analysis.

PMC2860887	R05004	The gender-stratified results in the CLHNS offspring indicated that the Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T association appeared slightly stronger in males (P = 1.1 × 10−16; β = 0.199; R2 = 7.3%) than females (P = 3.6 × 10−10; β
PMC2860887	R05006	The combined study of mothers and offspring for Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T resulted in a smaller P-value (P = 1.3 × 10−29) than when analyses were restricted to the offspring alone.
PMC2860887	R05009	The Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T genotypic means in the CLHNS mothers and offspring are most consistent with a recessive model for the T allele.
PMC2860887	R06000	Additional covariate adjustment for estimated folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 intake levels in our linear models did not appreciably change any tests of genotype association or genetic effect size estimates for CPS1 rs7422339 or Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T in either the CLHNS mother or offspring cohorts (data not shown).
PMC2860887	R06001	Furthermore, we found no evidence of interaction between Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T genotype and dietary intake levels of folate (data not shown).
PMC2860887	R07001	In addition to Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and CPS1, which showed stronger estimated effects in the CLHNS, association signals were replicated with similar effect sizes in NOX4, CHMPIA-DPEP1 and CENPQ-MUT, but not AKAP13, nor a second signal near Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Table 2).
PMC2860887	R08000	We examined additive and interaction effects for SNPs at the CPS1 and Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase loci in the CLHNS mothers.
PMC2860887	R08004	We also estimated the cumulative proportion of log-Hcy variability explained by five loci reported previously (13) that had at least nominal evidence of significance in the CLHNS mothers (CPS1 rs7422339, Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase rs1801133, NOX4 rs11018628, CHMPIA-DPEP1 rs460879 and CENPQ-MUT rs4267943) to be 5.9%.
PMC2860887	R11000	The CLHNS mothers also showed evidence for association with the widely studied Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T SNP (rs1801133), which explained an estimated 1.6% of the variation in log-Hcy levels.
PMC2860887	R11001	Follow-up analysis of the CLHNS young adult offspring (age 20–22 years) suggests that Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T has a much stronger effect in this younger generation, with an estimated proportion of variance explained by genotype of 6.3%, which is very large for a single SNP for a complex phenotype.
PMC2860887	R11003	These findings are consistent with several reports that have suggested that the effect of Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T is stronger in males than in females (10,19–21) and that the importance of Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T genotype decreases with increasing age (22), although no evidence for gender differences was reported in the PROCARDIS replication sample (13).
PMC2860887	R11005	In our study, CHLNS male offspring had significantly higher mean Hcy levels (P < 0.0001) than female offspring despite higher mean dietary intake of folate, vitamin B6 and vitamin B12 (Supplementary Material, Table S2), suggesting that any increase in the effect of Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T genotype in CLHNS male offspring compared with female offspring is not due to lower folate intake.
PMC2860887	R12001	In contrast to Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, the observed effect of CPS1 was stronger in the mothers than in the offspring (Table 1).
PMC2860887	R13000	Effect sizes appear substantially different between CLHNS and WGHS women at both the CPS1 and Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase loci.
PMC2860887	R13006	Similarly, Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T explained a greater proportion of the variability in log-Hcy levels in CLHNS mothers than in WGHS women (CLHNS R2 = 1.6%; WGHS R2 = 0.95%) despite a lower estimated frequency of the minor allele (0.22 versus 0.33).
PMC2860887	R13008	The estimated proportions of variability explained by CPS1 SNP rs7422339 (R2 = 0.9%) and Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T (R2 = 5.1%) in CLHNS female offspring were also higher than in WGHS women, although the estimated increase in log-Hcy levels per minor allele for rs7422339 in CLHNS female offspring was less than the estimated increase observed in WGHS women.
PMC2860887	R14003	We also found no evidence for any interactions between either CPS1 rs7422339 or Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T genotype and folate levels to suggest their genotypic effects are stronger in those with lower reported intake levels of folate.
PMC2860887	R16000	Finally, we did not replicate an observed association for rs1999594 near Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (13,14), for which a joint analysis including Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase SNPs rs1801133 and rs1999594 showed that both SNPs were significant (14).

PMC2891985	A02002	We also detected associations between generalized vitiligo and SNPs in two additional immune-related loci, RERE (P = 7.07×10−15) and GZMB (P = 3.44×10−8), and in a locus containing TYR (P = 1.60×10−18), encoding tyrosinase.
PMC2891985	D02000	In contrast, TYR encodes tyrosinase, which is not a component of the immune system.
PMC2891985	D02004	The 402Q variant of the TYR protein (the variant associated with melanoma) is thermosensitive38 and at 37°C tends to be misfolded, aberrantly glycosylated, retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, and subject to proteosomal degradation,39 resulting in steady-state 402Q tyrosinase activity that is only 25% of that of the major 402R polypeptide (which is associated with susceptibility to generalized vitiligo).38 Correct glycosylation of tyrosinase augments the generation of an MHC class I–restricted tyrosinase epitope that is presented by HLA-A*0201,40 the predominant HLA-A*02 allele, and indeed, we detected significant epistasis between HLA-A SNP rs12206499 and TYR SNP rs1393350 (P=0.03).
PMC2891985	D03000	Thus, 402R tyrosinase not only is expressed at higher levels than the 402Q variant but also may be more efficiently presented to the immune system by HLA-A*02.
PMC2891985	D03002	On the other hand, in persons carrying one or two copies of the 402Q variant, immune surveillance may fail to detect neoplastic melanocytes, owing to the reduced expression, and thus the reduced immune presentation, of tyrosinase.

PMC2891985	R16000	Tyrosinase is naturally presented by HLAA*0201 and is recognized by autologous cytotoxic T lymphocytes on HLA-A2–positive melanomas, which tend to show good response to immunotherapy.
PMC2891985	R16001	Presentation of TYR peptide by HLA-A*0201 may also mediate the loss of partial self-tolerance to tyrosinase.35 We therefore tested epistasis between HLA-A SNP rs12206499 and TYR SNP rs1393350 with logistic regression analysis, using SNP genotypes from the genomewide association study and replication set 1, thereby detecting evidence of significant epistasis between HLA-A and TYR (P=0.03).

PMC3000799	D00000	Asparaginase is an effective drug in the treatment of ALL.
PMC3000799	D00001	A major toxicity of L-asparaginase is allergy, which may attenuate the pharmacological effect of the drug.
PMC3000799	D00002	In the present study, we used a genome-wide interrogation that identified germline genetic variations in GRIA1, located at 5q33, that were associated with asparaginase allergy in both discovery and validation cohorts.
PMC3000799	D01000	Clinical symptoms of asparaginase allergy include localized pain, fever, skin rash, urticaria, respiratory distress, and anaphylaxis.
PMC3000799	D01002	Many of the asparaginase allergic reactions are typical of type I hypersensitivity, which is also a hallmark of asthma.
PMC3000799	D01003	In the present study, we found that SNPs on chromosome 5q33 were overrepresented as associated with asparaginase allergy (Figure 1).
PMC3000799	D02001	The same polymorphisms of GRIA1 that we found associated with asparaginase allergy are associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disease.(32, 33) All the genetic variations we identified in GRIA1 were in intronic sequences.
PMC3000799	D03000	Forty-one percent of the 498 patients who were treated with Total Therapy XV protocol had a hypersensitivity reaction to asparaginase, which is consistent with the reported frequency in children (up to 45%).(4–14)
PMC3000799	D03003	Interestingly, the occurrence of reactions differed between low risk arm and standard/high risk arm, which may be related to intermittent use in the low-risk arm compared to the weekly administration of asparaginase in the standard/high risk arm (Supplemental Table S3).
PMC3000799	D03004	Our findings support that the risk of hypersensitivity reactions may increase with read ministration after a period of no asparaginase therapy for at least a month.(14, 15)

PMC3000799	R00000	Of 498 patients, 204 (41%) developed an allergic reaction to asparaginase.
PMC3000799	R01000	Of the clinical variables including sex, age at diagnosis, racial ancestry, and risk arm, a low percentage of American Indian ancestry (p = 0.016) and assignment to the low risk treatment arm (p = 0.041) were significantly associated with the risk of asparaginase allergy.
PMC3000799	R02000	We analyzed the association between germline 364,033 SNP genotypes and asparaginase allergy in the discovery cohort of 322 patients (Supplemental Figure S1, Supplemental Table S2).

PMC3000799	R03001	Only one SNP (rs4958381), located in GRIA1, was significantly associated with asparaginase allergy (p = 2.9 × 10−3) (Table 2, Supplemental Table S3).
PMC3000799	R03002	In the combined cohort, the SNP genotypes at rs4958381 were significantly associated with asparaginase allergy at p = 3.5 × 10−7.
PMC3000799	R03003	Focusing on GR1A1, there were 11 additional SNPs in GRIA1 that were significantly associated with asparaginase allergy at p < 0.05 in the discovery cohort, 4 of which (rs10070447, rs6890057, rs4958676, and rs6889909) were significantly associated in the validation cohort (Table 3, Supplemental Figure S2).
PMC3000799	R03004	In the combined cohort, 9 SNPs in GRIA1 were significantly associated with asparaginase allergy (p < 0.05, Table 3, Supplemental Table S3).
PMC3000799	R03005	An example is shown for rs4958381 (Figure 2); there was a monotonic relationship between the number of copies of the A allele and the risk of asparaginase allergy in patients on the low risk and standard/high risk treatment arms.
PMC3000799	R03006	Overall, the cumulative incidence of asparaginase allergy was 74%, 44%, and 32% for patients with the AA, AG, or GG genotypes, respectively.
PMC3000799	R03007	There was not an association between these genotypes and the severity of asparaginase allergy (≧ grade 2 vs. < grade 2, p = 0.61, by linear regression model).

PMC3033185	D03003	The gene product (proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 7, PC7/8) is a convertase similar to furin (PCSK3) that belongs to a family of proteases acting on various physiological pathways and having functional overlap in many but not all circumstances (19).
PMC3033185	D04000	First, furin and/or furin-like convertases function in iron homeostasis by generating soluble haemojuvelin (sHJV) from cellular haemojuvelin (20,21).
PMC3033185	D04006	Prohepcidin processing is another possible mechanism by which proprotein convertases such as PCSK7 could influence sTfR levels indirectly via the hepcidin regulation of iron homeostasis (25).
PMC3033185	D04007	Since the other eight proprotein convertases also might have such effects on sTfR generation, we tested them for association with log10(sTfR).
PMC3033185	D05000	Alternatively, however, PCSK7 may be involved more directly in sTfR release from membrane-bound TfR. Indeed, sTfR is shed from the cell surface by proteolytic cleavage, primarily mediated by a metalloprotease, which is likely activated by a furin-like convertase, as the activation is sensitive to inhibitors of these convertases (26).

PMC3196893	A00000	Serum butyrylcholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase) activity is associated with obesity, blood pressure and biomarkers of cardiovascular and diabetes risk.
PMC3196893	A00001	We have conducted a genome-wide association scan to discover genetic variants affecting butyrylcholinesterase activity, and to clarify whether the associations between butyrylcholinesterase activity and cardiometabolic risk factors are caused by variation in BCHE or whether BCHE variation is secondary to the metabolic abnormalities.
PMC3196893	A00002	We measured serum butyrylcholinesterase in adolescents and adults from three cohorts of Australian twin and family studies.
PMC3196893	A00003	The genotypes from ∼2.4 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were available in 8791 participants with butyrylcholinesterase measurements.
PMC3196893	A00004	We detected significant associations with butyrylcholinesterase activity at three independent groups of SNPs at the butyrylcholinesterase locus (P = 5.8 × 10−262, 7.8 × 10−47, 2.9 × 10−12) and at four other loci: RNPEP (P = 9.4 × 10−16), RAPH1-ABI2 (P = 4.1 × 10−18), UGT1A1 (P = 4.0 × 10−8) and an intergenic region on chromosome 8 (P = 1.4 × 10−8).
PMC3196893	A00005	These loci affecting butyrylcholinesterase activity were not associated with metabolic risk factors.
PMC3196893	A00006	On the other hand, SNPs in genes previously associated with metabolic risk had effects on butyrylcholinesterase activity more often than can be explained by chance.
PMC3196893	A00007	In particular, SNPs within FTO and GCKR were associated with butyrylcholinesterase activity, but their effects were partly mediated by body mass index and triglycerides, respectively.
PMC3196893	A00008	We conclude that variation in butyrylcholinesterase activity is due to multiple variants across the spectrum from uncommon/large effect to common/small effect, and partly results from (rather than causes) metabolic abnormalities.
PMC3196893	D00000	We found seven independent genome-wide significant loci (P < 5 × 10−8) affecting butyrylcholinesterase activity; three in or near butyrylcholinesterase, and one each at ABI2-RAPH1, RNPEP, UGT1A and an intergenic region on Chr 8.
PMC3196893	D00001	In view of the phenotypic correlations between butyrylcholinesterase activity and the quantitative risk factors which define or accompany the metabolic syndrome, we can consider the genetic sources of variation in plasma butyrylcholinesterase activity in the population in two categories.
PMC3196893	D00002	Direct effects act on the expression of the butyrylcholinesterase gene or the amino acid sequence of the encoded protein, or potentially on the processing, secretion or circulation lifetime of the butyrylcholinesterase protein.
PMC3196893	D00003	Indirect allelic effects on butyrylcholinesterase activity are those which primarily affect the cluster of characteristics associated with cardiovascular and metabolic risk such as obesity, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and fatty liver, for which butyrylcholinesterase activity is a biomarker.
PMC3196893	D00004	These indirect allelic effects (together with non-genetic causes of covariation) contribute to the correlations between butyrylcholinesterase and the biochemical markers of metabolic risk.
PMC3196893	D00005	The concept of genetic effects on butyrylcholinesterase activity mediated through metabolic risk is supported by the suggestive associations between loci previously reported to affect obesity, glucose homeostasis or plasma lipids and butyrylcholinesterase activity, and by the results of Mendelian randomization analysis.
PMC3196893	D01000	The most significant association between typed or imputed SNPs and butyrylcholinesterase activity was for rs1803274, the well-recognized K-variant in butyrylcholinesterase.
PMC3196893	D01001	A large number of other SNPs in or near the butyrylcholinesterase gene also achieved genome-wide significance (see Supplementary Material, Table S3).
PMC3196893	D01003	However, when we adjust for the effects of rs1803274 as a covariate in the association analysis, then a second set of SNPs within butyrylcholinesterase shows significant association (minimum P = 7.8 × 10−47, for rs2668196).
PMC3196893	D01004	This SNP is in intron 3 of the butyrylcholinesterase gene and has no known functional significance.
PMC3196893	D01005	A further iteration revealed another independent group of SNPs about 250 kbp from butyrylcholinesterase, but not near any other gene; the strongest association (P = 2.9 × 10−12) is for rs2034445, which like rs2668196 has no known function.
PMC3196893	D01006	This region presumably contains variation which affects the expression of butyrylcholinesterase; there are many examples of SNPs discovered through genome-wide association studies which regulate genes at some distance from their location (21,22).
PMC3196893	D01007	Our findings illustrate the complexity of the butyrylcholinesterase locus, with multiple influences on gene expression or protein sequence and stability.
PMC3196893	D01010	For the purposes of examining whether butyrylcholinesterase SNPs affect the metabolic variables correlated with butyrylcholinesterase enzyme activity, the K variant and all other variants associated with it were taken as a group and the absence of positive results makes it unnecessary to determine which is or are causal.
PMC3196893	D02000	Four other loci showed genome-wide significant associations with butyrylcholinesterase activity, as summarized in Table 1.
PMC3196893	D02001	The ABI2 gene has no obvious connection with cholinesterase activity, coding for a tumour suppressor and cell migration inhibitor.
PMC3196893	D02003	Although the most significant SNP association in this region is within the ABI2 gene, butyrylcholinesterase associations cover a substantial region including WDR12, ALS2CR8, CYP20A1, ABI2 and RAPH1 (Fig. 4).
PMC3196893	D02004	Among these genes, RAPH1 codes for lamellipodin, which gives rise to proline-rich peptides which promote the tetramerization and stability of butyrylcholinesterase (25).
PMC3196893	D02006	Variation at this locus may be the cause of the high-molecular-weight electrophoretic variant of butyrylcholinesterase, through effects on butyrylcholinesterase polymerization, but we have not tested this.
PMC3196893	D03000	RNPEP codes for aminopeptidase B, which is an exopeptidase selectively removing arginine or lysine residues from the amino-terminal end of peptides.
PMC3196893	D03001	It may be involved in post-translational modification of proteins (26) and since butyrylcholinesterase is synthesized as a precursor protein which needs to be processed before secretion, there may be a necessary role for aminopeptidase B.
PMC3196893	D04001	The relevance for butyrylcholinesterase activity is obscure, though it has been claimed that UGT1A1 variants may decrease oxidative stress and fatty liver through the antioxidant effect of increased bilirubin concentration (27).
PMC3196893	D05000	Using the data from all 2000–2005 Adult Study participants with relevant measurements, we confirmed substantial and highly significant phenotypic correlations between butyrylcholinesterase activity and the cluster of characteristics related to obesity, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and fatty liver (see Supplementary Material, Table S1).
PMC3196893	D05001	Factor analysis showed that butyrylcholinesterase activity clustered with the measured metabolic and cardiovascular risk factors, as seen from the factor loadings for phenotypes which are known to predict risk of cardiovascular disease or type 2 diabetes (Fig. 1).
PMC3196893	D06000	These correlations were notably stronger in adults than in adolescents, suggesting age-dependent development of inter-individual differences affecting both butyrylcholinesterase activity and the other components of an adverse metabolic risk profile.
PMC3196893	D06001	Perhaps related to this, the estimated heritability of butyrylcholinesterase activity declined from an extremely high value of 0.95 in the adolescents to a still substantial 0.65 in the adults.
PMC3196893	D06003	This is compatible with the concept that age-related ‘wear and tear’ of mainly random or environmental origin contributes to the covariation between butyrylcholinesterase and the other metabolic abnormalities, which is present to a greater extent in adults than adolescents.
PMC3196893	D06004	Also relevant to the idea of novel influences in the adult group, the total variance was almost twice as great in the 2000–2005 Adult Study data compared with the Adolescents, even though butyrylcholinesterase activity was measured using the same method, in the same laboratory and over the same time period.
PMC3196893	D06005	The cumulative frequency distributions for butyrylcholinesterase activity in adults and adolescents, and the estimated genetic (A) and non-shared environmental (E) components of variance, are compared in Supplementary Material, Figure S1 and both the dispersion of results and the E component are substantially greater in adults.
PMC3196893	D07000	Turning to common genetic effects on butyrylcholinesterase activity and metabolic syndrome components, the largest genetic influence on butyrylcholinesterase activity was associated with the non-synonymous coding SNP rs1803274, the K variant.
PMC3196893	D07001	This SNP was used to test whether a genetic effect on butyrylcholinesterase leads to variation in the other clinically important variables which showed strong phenotypic correlations with butyrylcholinesterase activity.
PMC3196893	D07002	The negative results for this and for the other significant loci (Supplementary Material, Table S4), consistent with those previously reported for glucose and insulin-related measures in Danish subjects (30), show that variation in these metabolic risk factors is not caused by variation in butyrylcholinesterase activity.
PMC3196893	D08000	Conversely, we tested whether the gene polymorphisms which have been shown to affect the lipid and metabolic syndrome-related variables also have effects on butyrylcholinesterase activity.
PMC3196893	D08001	Out of 203 SNPs at 97 loci, 19 SNPs at eight loci (CDH13, CELSR2, FADS2, FTO, GCKR, MC4R, MTNR1B and NCAN) showed associations with butyrylcholinesterase at P < 0.01
PMC3196893	D08005	The gene product, glucokinase regulatory protein, plays a key role in glucose homeostasis through binding to glucokinase and controlling glycogen synthesis, glycolysis and glucose uptake by hepatocytes (35).
PMC3196893	D08006	Other genes with significant butyrylcholinesterase associations included MC4R, related to melatonin and with reported associations with obesity, insulin sensitivity and glucose concentration (36–41), and MTNR1B (42) coding for a melatonin receptor implicated in glucose homeostasis (43,44); the cluster of FADS genes (particularly FADS2) coding for fatty acid desaturases; FTO, which is strongly implicated in obesity (39,40,45); and members of the cadherin family (CDH13, CELSR2) (46).
PMC3196893	D08008	However, it is also notable that there are gene variants with strong effects on phenotypes correlated with butyrylcholinesterase activity which do not show effects on butyrylcholinesterase.
PMC3196893	D08010	[P = 5.22 × 10−201 for urate (32), but P = 0.953 for butyrylcholinesterase in our data] and rs1532624 in CETP
PMC3196893	D09000	Out of these associations with butyrylcholinesterase activity, we chose GCKR and FTO to test whether results are consistent with the direction of causation being SNP→metabolic→BCHE activity.
PMC3196893	D09001	Both the comparison of these SNP-BCHE associations with and without inclusion of the postulated intermediate (triglycerides and BMI), and the comparison of observed associations with those expected from the GCKR-triglycerides and triglycerides-BCHE associations, or the FTO-BMI and BMI-BCHE associations, were consistent with the model of indirect effects of these SNPs on butyrylcholinesterase activity.
PMC3196893	D10000	The main conclusion from our results is that butyrylcholinesterase activity is a biomarker of the events and processes which lead to dyslipidaemia and metabolic syndrome and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and genes which affect this metabolic risk have indirect effects on butyrylcholinesterase activity.
PMC3196893	D10002	Further studies to evaluate butyrylcholinesterase activity (adjusted for at least K-variant status) as a marker of clinically diagnosed metabolic syndrome, and as a predictive risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes, would be justified.
PMC3196893	D11000	In a different context, genetic variation in butyrylcholinesterase activity is relevant to its use as a diagnostic test.
PMC3196893	D11001	The butyrylcholinesterase enzyme is inhibited by organophosphate compounds including insecticides and nerve agents, and activity measurements on plasma or serum can be used for the assessment of exposure to these (48,49).
PMC3196893	D11002	When pre-exposure butyrylcholinesterase activity of a patient is not known, knowledge of genotype would allow use of narrower genotype-specific reference intervals and potentially better diagnosis of organophosphate poisoning.
PMC3196893	D12000	In relation to genetic architecture, variation in serum butyrylcholinesterase activity results from a combination of rare Mendelian, reasonably common oligogenic and polygenic gene effects, together with secondary effects from other phenotypes which are in turn subject to both genetic and environmental influences.
PMC3196893	D12001	The oligogenic effect of the K variant in butyrylcholinesterase is substantial, accounting for ∼16% of variance in the phenotype through a combination of high prevalence and moderate effect size.

PMC3196893	I00001	A more recently appreciated aspect of butyrylcholinesterase activity is its association with plasma lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, obesity, components of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (3–13).
PMC3196893	I00002	Despite numerous pharmacogenetic and disease association studies, the physiological functions of butyrylcholinesterase and the reasons for associations between butyrylcholinesterase activity and components of the metabolic syndrome are unknown.
PMC3196893	I01000	The butyrylcholinesterase enzyme is coded by the butyrylcholinesterase locus at 167 Mb on chromosome (Chr) 3.
PMC3196893	I02000	Several lines of evidence connect genetic variation in butyrylcholinesterase with obesity and obesity-related disease.
PMC3196893	I02001	Studies on butyrylcholinesterase knockout mice have shown unexpected effects on body weight.
PMC3196893	I02003	Conversely, people with high butyrylcholinesterase activity and an additional electrophoretic butyrylcholinesterase band (15) may have lower body weight than controls (16).
PMC3196893	I02004	There are also reports that the K-variant in butyrylcholinesterase is associated with type 2 diabetes (17) and with coronary artery disease (18,19).
PMC3196893	I03000	Other evidence connects butyrylcholinesterase activity, rather than genotype, with obesity and its metabolic consequences.
PMC3196893	I03001	We have previously shown that higher butyrylcholinesterase activity is associated with higher body mass index (BMI), higher triglycerides, lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and lower insulin sensitivity (10).
PMC3196893	I03002	We also reported highly significant butyrylcholinesterase associations with serum total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, apolipoproteins B and E, urate, gammaglutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and blood pressure.
PMC3196893	I03004	These associations with butyrylcholinesterase activity have been confirmed, and extended to measures of visceral, subcutaneous and hepatic fat stores (11,12), with higher butyrylcholinesterase being associated with less favourable lipid and adiposity status.
PMC3196893	I03005	These results are consistent with plasma or serum butyrylcholinesterase activity being a marker of metabolic syndrome and fatty liver, but previous studies have not combined comprehensive genotyping with measurement of both butyrylcholinesterase activity and metabolic variables.
PMC3196893	I03006	Advances in SNP genotyping and imputation of untyped SNPs, and discovery of loci affecting lipids and/or metabolic syndrome, allow us to investigate causality in the associations between butyrylcholinesterase activity and variables related to obesity.
PMC3196893	I04000	This paper presents a genome-wide association study to investigate the genetic causes of variation in serum butyrylcholinesterase activity in the general population, and the causes of its covariation with markers of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk.
PMC3196893	I04001	The results of these tests for genotype–phenotype associations improve our understanding of the relationship between butyrylcholinesterase and cardiovascular and diabetes risk factors.
PMC3196893	R00000	There were highly significant (P < 10−9) phenotypic correlations between butyrylcholinesterase activity and BMI, HDL- and LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, insulin, C-reactive protein, urate, ferritin, GGT and ALT in the 2000–2005 Adult Studies.
PMC3196893	R00002	Significant correlations were also found between butyrylcholinesterase activity and BMI, LDL-C, triglycerides and ALT in the Adolescent Study, but the correlations were less than in the adults and there was evidence of significant heterogeneity of the correlations between adults and adolescents.
PMC3196893	R01000	Factor analysis using data from the 2000–2005 Adult Studies illustrated the relationships between butyrylcholinesterase activity and other variables related to metabolic syndrome and/or cardiovascular risk.
PMC3196893	R01001	The clustering of factor loadings for butyrylcholinesterase activity and these correlated variables for two unrotated principal components (PCs) are shown in Figure 1; butyrylcholinesterase is located close to the lipids, BMI, glucose and insulin, urate and C-reactive protein.
PMC3196893	R02003	As well as the difference in additive genetic variance estimates between adolescents and adults, the total butyrylcholinesterase variance in the 2000–2005 Adult Studies was almost twice that in the Adolescent Study (s2 4 383 970 against 2 323 141, F15642,770 = 1.887, P = 8.56 × 10−29).
PMC3196893	R02004	The differing distributions for butyrylcholinesterase activity in adults and adolescents are shown in Supplementary Material, Figure S1.
PMC3196893	R04001	These SNPs were at or near the butyrylcholinesterase gene (Chr 3), RNPEP1 (Chr 1) and ABI2 (Chr 2).
PMC3196893	R05000	To find other SNPs independently associated with butyrylcholinesterase levels, we next conducted association analysis after adjusting for the substantial effect of the butyrylcholinesterase K-variant (rs1803274) in each cohort.
PMC3196893	R05001	In the discovery samples, we found additional SNPs within the butyrylcholinesterase locus independently and significantly associated with butyrylcholinesterase activity, with rs2668196 being the most significant at P = 2.9 × 10−31.
PMC3196893	R05003	The meta-analysis of these conditional analysis results revealed two other loci significantly associated with butyrylcholinesterase activity, i.e. UGT1A (rs7592624; P = 4.1 × 10−8) and intergenic region of Chr 8 between PPP1R3B and TNKS (rs6601299; P = 1.4 × 10−8).
PMC3196893	R05004	Repeating this process by adjusting for rs2268196 as well as rs1803274 revealed a further set of independent SNPs near butyrylcholinesterase, with the most significant association at rs2034445 (P = 4 × 10−13), some 250 kbp from the butyrylcholinesterase gene (Fig. 3).
PMC3196893	R05006	Significant and independent SNP associations accounted for ∼22% of total variation in butyrylcholinesterase activity in the combined data.
PMC3196893	R06000	Apart from rs1803274 (the K-variant), which showed a minor allele frequency of 0.21 in our data, butyrylcholinesterase deficiency variants were uncommon.
PMC3196893	R07002	To check whether the associations between butyrylcholinesterase activity and BMI or triglycerides were both caused by the K variant, we compared the effect size of butyrylcholinesterase activity on BMI or triglycerides before and after adjusting for the effect K variant.
PMC3196893	R07003	In the 2000–2005 Adult Studies, we found that the effect sizes (beta) of butyrylcholinesterase activity on BMI or triglycerides were 0.234 ± 0.012 and 0.313 ± 0.012, respectively.
PMC3196893	R07004	When we adjusted butyrylcholinesterase activity for the effect of K variant, the effect sizes increased to 0.268 ± 0.013 and 0.353 ± 0.013, respectively.
PMC3196893	R07005	This showed that the associations between butyrylcholinesterase activity and BMI or triglycerides were not attenuated by adjustment for the K variant; this is the outcome expected if the K variant affects butyrylcholinesterase activity but not BMI or triglycerides.
PMC3196893	R08000	Conversely, we tested the effects of loci previously reported to affect other metabolic syndrome components on butyrylcholinesterase activity.
PMC3196893	R08002	Nineteen SNPs at eight of the loci (see Supplementary Material, Table S5) showed associations with butyrylcholinesterase at P < 0.01
PMC3196893	R09000	The traits most strongly correlated with butyrylcholinesterase activity are triglycerides and BMI.
PMC3196893	R09002	We found that these variants were also associated with butyrylcholinesterase activity (P-values from the combined data were 0.0003 and 0.0025, respectively).
PMC3196893	R09003	To test whether the associations between these variants and butyrylcholinesterase activity were mediated by triglycerides or BMI, respectively, we performed a Mendelian randomization method (20).
PMC3196893	R09007	In this cohort, these SNPs were associated with butyrylcholinesterase activity (P = 0.006 and 0.004, respectively).
PMC3196893	R09009	SD increase in butyrylcholinesterase activity, respectively (Supplementary Material, Table S6).
PMC3196893	R09010	Given the FTO-BMI and BMI-BCHE activity associations, the expected effect of FTO variant on butyrylcholinesterase activity was 0.012 ± 0.004 SD.
PMC3196893	R09011	Similarly, the expected GCKR variant effect on butyrylcholinesterase activity was 0.028 ± 0.006 SD.
PMC3196893	R09012	We then compared the observed effects of FTO or GCKR variants on butyrylcholinesterase activity with those expected given the FTO-BMI and BMI-BCHE associations, or the GCKR-triglycerides and triglycerides-BCHE associations.
PMC3196893	R10002	Accordingly, the effects of FTO and GCKR variants on butyrylcholinesterase activity were reduced to 0.037 ± 0.019 and 0.025 ± 0.018 SD, respectively (Supplementary Material, Table S6).
PMC3196893	R10003	These results showed that the associations between FTO or GCKR variants and butyrylcholinesterase activity were partly mediated by the associations between triglycerides or BMI and butyrylcholinesterase activity.

PMC3499946	A01002	Arylesterase remained significant after adjusting for traditional risk factors, C-reactive protein, and creatinine clearance (HR 2.20, 95%CI 1.60–3.02, p<0.01), predicted future development of MACE in both primary and secondary prevention populations, and reclassified risk categories incrementally to traditional clinical variables.
PMC3499946	A01003	A genome-wide association study (GWAS) identified distinct SNPs within the PON-1 gene that were highly significantly associated with serum paraoxonase (1.18×10−303) or arylesterase (4.99×10−116) activity but these variants were not associated with either 3-year MACE risk in an angiographic cohort (n=2,136) or history of either coronary artery disease or myocardial infarction in the CARDIoGRAM consortium (n~80,000 subjects).
PMC3499946	A02000	Diminished serum arylesterase activity, but not the genetic determinants of PON-1 functional measures, provides incremental prognostic value and clinical reclassification of stable subjects at risk of developing MACE.
PMC3499946	D00000	Paraoxonase-1 is an atherosclerosis protective enzyme associated with HDL and systemic anti-oxidant function.
PMC3499946	D00001	Its catalytic activity within crude serum mixtures has traditionally been measured by quantifying enzymatic hydrolysis rates of two known in vitro substrates, with functional activities named paraoxonase and arylesterase activities4, 5.
PMC3499946	D00003	First, we demonstrated prognostic value of serum arylesterase activity (and to a lesser extent serum paraoxonase activity) in predicting long-term cardiovascular risk in a wide range of subjects already treated with contemporary medical therapy.
PMC3499946	D00004	We observed that diminished serum arylesterase activity, particularly within the lowest quartile range, was predictive of adverse long-term cardiac events independent of standard clinical and biochemical risk factors, and provided incremental value in reclassifying subjects who are at higher risk of long-term MACE.
PMC3499946	D00005	Furthermore, the prognostic value of serum arylesterase activity was evident in both primary as well as secondary prevention subjects.
PMC3499946	D00006	The fact that arylesterase activity provided prognostic value consistently within subjects with or without underlying angiographic evidence of significant CAD implies that a lack of systemic anti-oxidant defense mechanisms (a primary function of PON-1) may both promote greater vulnerability to oxidative stress, as well as increase risk for development and progression of CAD in subjects.
PMC3499946	D00007	Moreover, the ability of low serum arylesterase activity to identify those at significant increased risk of MACE, even among primary prevention subjects with recent coronary angiographic data showing < 50% stenosis in all major coronary vessels, suggests this assay has prognostic value, and can identify a vulnerable cohort of subjects who otherwise are not identified as being at high risk.
PMC3499946	D00008	Taken together, the present results suggest that enzymatic activity measures with arylesterase, more so than paraoxonase, serve as a powerful prognostic indicator of cardiovascular risk in a broad spectrum of subjects.
PMC3499946	D01000	Studies on PON-1 activities have relied on quantifying its wide ranges of enzymatic activities in breaking down in vitro substrates like paraoxon (paraoxonase activity) and phenylacetate (arylesterase activity).
PMC3499946	D01002	Hence, the distinction between serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities in predicting future adverse cardiac events is somewhat unexpected, even though historically the correlation between these two measures has not been particularly tight.
PMC3499946	D01003	The unique relationship between the two PON-1 activity measurements is largely the result of a very strong association between serum paraoxonase activity and its underlying genetic determinants, which may also explain why serum arylesterase activity is normally distributed while serum paraoxonase activity was not.
PMC3499946	D01004	Meanwhile, the strong association between the PON gene cluster and serum arylesterase activity confirms the long-standing assumption that this locus harbors important genetic determinants of serum arylesterase activity.
PMC3499946	D02000	The significant genetic associations revealed by the GWAS analyses for paraoxonase and arylesterase activities are of further interest for several reasons.
PMC3499946	D02001	First, there was a stronger relationship between serum paraoxonase activity levels and its genetic determinants than those with serum arylesterase activity.
PMC3499946	D02002	Second, our results confirm the strong association of PON-1 variants with serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities and demonstrate that the two measured enzymatic functions are associated in a Mendelian-like fashion by a single, major locus on chromosome 7 containing the PON gene cluster.
PMC3499946	D02003	This is supported by the GWAS analyses conditioned on the lead SNPs, which did not identify other genomic regions associated with either paraoxonase or arylesterase activity.
PMC3499946	D02005	However, while the PON-1 variants exhibited strong (if not opposed) effects on PON function, they were not associated with future risk of MACE, either individually or as a haplotype that modestly decreased both paraoxonase and arylesterase activity.
PMC3499946	D03000	The lack of associations between the lead SNPs for PON and arylesterase activities with CAD and MI risks in humans in our study are in direct contrast to what has been observed in mice where PON-1 deficiency leads to increased aortic lesion formation3, and transgenic mice over expressing PON-1 are protected 15, 16.
PMC3499946	D03001	It is of interest that the PON-1 transgenic mouse models demonstrating protective effects have 50–400% increased serum arylesterase activity 15, 16, far in excess of the modest changes in activity associated with the peak SNP identified in the arylesterase GWAS.
PMC3499946	D03002	If arylesterase activity is the more important atheroprotective aspect of PON-1 function, as our clinical associations with MACE suggest, then it may not be surprising that an association was not observed with the SNPs identified.
PMC3499946	D03003	For example, the lead SNP for arylesterase activity (rs854572) only increases activity by ~16% per minor allele copy.
PMC3499946	D03004	It is thus possible that the genetic effects on arylesterase activity from this SNP are too weak to observe, especially if a minimum biological threshold of activity change is needed to influence risk of prevalent CAD, history of MI, or incident risk of MACE.
PMC3499946	D04000	The ability for serum arylesterase activity to identify a high-risk population in the primary prevention cohort that just underwent cardiac catheterization and showed no significant evidence of stenoses in any major vessel may have important clinical implications.
PMC3499946	D04002	Use of serum arylesterase activity may thus have clinical utility, and help identify an important patient cohort that may warrant more aggressive risk factor reduction treatment strategies who might otherwise not be targeted for aggressive preventive intervention.
PMC3499946	D04003	In addition to low serum arylesterase activity predicting increased risk for MACE in primary prevention subjects, there was a direct association also noted between lower serum arylesterase activity level and increased prevalence of significantly obstructive CAD by angiography.
PMC3499946	D04004	Of note, we did not find a strong relationship between systemic inflammatory biomarkers, such as C-reactive protein or leukocyte parameters, with serum arylesterase levels in this group of stable cardiac patients.
PMC3499946	D05001	Serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities utilized substrates that are not the endogenous substrates for PON-1, but are used because they are not readily influenced by other esterases/lactonases in serum, and are presumed to reflect the underlying catalytic activity of PON-1.
PMC3499946	D05002	The GWAS results observed demonstrate these assumptions are reasonable, as only genetic variations in the PON-1 gene were observed to be associated with variations in paraoxonase and arylesterase activities.
PMC3499946	D05004	Hence, we are unable to determine the variability and prognostic value of level changes over time and the impact of dietary or therapeutic interventions on serum arylesterase activity level.

PMC3499946	I00000	Heightened oxidative stress in the form of oxidation of lipids and proteins by reactive oxidant species adversely contributes to disease progression in cardiovascular disease (CVD)1. Paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) belongs to a family of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated enzymes that show hydrolytic activity towards a variety of substrates, including toxins in the environment2 and oxidized lipids in the body3.
PMC3499946	I00001	Consequently, diminished activities of PON-1 and other paraoxonases have been associated with the development of CVD4, 5.
PMC3499946	I00002	Paraoxonase-1 (EC 3.1.1.2) activity in serum is classically named after the substrate used to monitor enzymatic function, namely, paraoxonase activity (using paraoxon as substrate) and arylesterase activity (using phenyl acetate as substrate) 6.
PMC3499946	I00004	Based upon these encouraging findings, we developed analytically validated semi-automated high throughput methods for arylesterase and paraoxonase activity assays amenable to large scale clinical and genetic studies.
PMC3499946	I00006	In addition, we sought to identify genetic loci controlling paraoxonase and arylesterase activity by carrying out an unbiased genome-wide association study (GWAS) and determine whether these genetic factors were associated with incident risks of adverse cardiac events or prevalent coronary artery disease (CAD).
PMC3499946	M03000	Serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities were measured by spectrophotometry in an open channel on the aforementioned Architect ci8200 platform, and in a 96-well plate format (Spectramax 384 Plus, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, California), respectively.
PMC3499946	M03001	For serum paraoxonase activity, the rate of generation of para-nitrophenol was determined at 405 nm in 40-fold diluted serum (final) in reaction mixtures compose of 1.5mM paraoxon (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri), 10mM Tris hydrocholoride, pH 8, 1M sodium chloride, and 2mM calcium chloride at 24°C.
PMC3499946	M03003	M−1•cm−1 was used for calculating units of paraoxonase activity, which is expressed as nanomoles of para-nitrophenol produced per minute per milliliter of serum.
PMC3499946	M03004	The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variance for the high throughput paraoxonase activity assay were 1.9% and 3.3%, respectively, on 30 replicates performed on 15 different days.
PMC3499946	M03005	For serum arylesterase activity measurement, initial hydrolysis rates were determined at 270 nm in 50-fold diluted serum (final) in reactions mixtures composed of 3.4mM phenylacetate (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, Missouri),
PMC3499946	M03007	An extinction coefficient (at 270 nm) of 1310M−1•cm−1 was used for calculating units of arylesterase activity, which are expressed as micromoles of phenyl acetate hydrolyzed per minute per milliliter of serum.
PMC3499946	M03008	The intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variance for arylesterase activity assay were 3.4% and 3.9%, respectively, on 20 replicates performed on 10 different days.
PMC3499946	M06000	Genome-wide linear regression analyses were used to identify loci associated with serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activity after adjustment for age and gender under an additive model.
PMC3499946	R00001	Serum arylesterase activity levels were normally distributed, with a mean of 104 ±25 µmol/min/mL.
PMC3499946	R00002	However, serum paraoxonase activity levels were not normally distributed, with a median of 562 µmol/min/mL (interquartile range 315–1,045 µmol/min/mL).
PMC3499946	R00003	Both serum paraoxonase and arylesterase levels were lower in men than in women.
PMC3499946	R00004	Compared to those in the highest quartile, subjects in the lowest quartile of serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activity were more likely to have significantly obstructive (≥50% stenosis) coronary artery disease (odds ratio 1.86 [95% CI 1.53, 2.27] p<0.01 for arylesterase, and 1.48 [95% CI 1.22, 1.81] p<0.01 for paraoxonase).
PMC3499946	R00006	In addition, there were very weak (but statistically significant) correlations between serum arylesterase activity and hsCRP (r=−0.09, p<0.001), estimated creatinine clearance (eCrCl, r= 0.15, p<0.001), and absolute lymphocyte count (r=0.09, p<0.001).
PMC3499946	R00007	In contrast, there was no statistically significant relationship between serum arylesterase activity and leukocyte count (r=0.02, p=0.28) or absolute neutrophil count (r=0.002, p=0.91).
PMC3499946	R01001	Lower serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activity levels were associated with poorer long-term outcomes when stratified by quartiles (Table 2, Figure 1).
PMC3499946	R01002	After adjusting for Framingham risk factors, eCrCl, diabetes mellitus and log-transformed hsCRP, lower serum arylesterase activity (HR 2.20
PMC3499946	R01003	[95%CI 1.60–3.02], p<0. 01) and to a lesser extent lower serum paraoxonase activity (HR 1.39
PMC3499946	R01005	"Even when cTnI levels were added to the model (within the ""normal"" range of 0.001–0.029 mg/dL), lower serum arylesterase levels still maintain a 2-fold increased risk in MACE at 3 years (HR 2.04"
PMC3499946	R01008	The addition of serum arylesterase activity or serum paraoxonase activity to the model results in significant improvement in risk classification with net reclassification index (NRI) of 7.9% for arylesterase activity (p=0.003) and 7.2% for paraoxonase activity (p=0.002).
PMC3499946	R01009	The prognostic value of serum arylesterase activity was observed within the secondary prevention cohort (Table 2), as well as within subjects who demonstrated a recent “normal catheterization” (i.e., no significant (>50%) angiographic evidence of CAD in any major vessel or preceding history of CAD – the primary prevention cohort, Table 2).
PMC3499946	R01010	Serum arylesterase activity also remained a prognostic indicator within each Framingham risk factor sub-cohort and among those with low hsCRP
PMC3499946	R01012	In addition to serum arylesterase remaining a significant predictor of MACE after addition of higher sensitivity troponin testing to traditional risk factors and laboratory risk markers in the models, we further observed an increased risk of developing subclinical myocardial necrosis (troponin levels that are detectable but remain below the 99th percentile diagnostic cutoff among healthy subjects used to define cutoff for MI) with decreasing quartiles of serum arylesterase levels (odds ratio 2.01
PMC3499946	R01013	[95%CI 1.53–2.64], p<0.001, Figure 3) – this trend was not observed with serum paraoxonase activity levels (Figure 3).
PMC3499946	R02000	We next performed a GWAS for serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activity in 2,136 GeneBank subjects (all of Caucasian ancestry) for whom both genotype and PON-1 functional data were available.
PMC3499946	R02001	The genomic inflation factors for paraoxonase and arylesterase activity were 1.015 and 1.013, respectively, indicating that the GWAS results were not confounded by underlying population stratification, and the Q-Q plots are shown in Supplemental Figure 1.
PMC3499946	R02002	Serum paraoxonase activity was controlled by a major locus on chromosome 7 containing the PON-1, PON-2, and PON-3 genes (Figure 4A).
PMC3499946	R02003	The lead SNP for serum paraoxonase activity at this locus (rs2057681) is located within the PON-1 gene and yielded a highly significant p-value of 1.18 × 10−303 (Figure 4A, Table 3).
PMC3499946	R02004	Based on our genotype data, rs2057681 is in near complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2=0.99) with a functional amino acid substitution in PON-1 (rs662; Q192R), which is also associated with increased paraoxonase activity (p=3.31 × 10−295; Table 3).
PMC3499946	R02005	Of interest, while rs2057681 and rs662 are associated with significant increase in paraoxonase activity, they are also associated with significant decrease in arylesterase activity (Table 3).
PMC3499946	R02006	Another known coding SNP in PON-1 (rs854560; L55M) exhibited significant association with paraoxonase activity as well (p=1.27 × 10−140; Table 3) but is in relatively weak LD (r2=0.20) with the aforementioned lead SNPs (rs2057681 and rs662).
PMC3499946	R02007	The GWAS analysis for serum arylesterase activity also revealed that this chromosome 7 region was the major locus controlling this measure of PON-1 functional activity (Figure 4B).
PMC3499946	R02008	For example, the lead SNP for serum arylesterase activity, rs854572, is located in the promoter region of PON-1 and yielded a highly significant p value of p=4.99 × 10−116 (Table 3).
PMC3499946	R02009	This SNP (rs854572) also was associated with increase in paraoxonase activity.
PMC3499946	R02010	Of note, the four lead SNPs for arylesterase activity differ from those identified for paraoxonase activity, although they do exhibit some association with paraoxonase activity and vice versa (Table 3).
PMC3499946	R02011	However, the lead SNPs for arylesterase and paraoxonase activity are in weak LD (r2<0.23), suggesting that the reciprocal associations are for the most part independent.
PMC3499946	R02012	Further, the lead SNPs for both paraoxonase (rs2057681) and arylesterase (rs854572) activities are localized in the PON-1 gene and not in LD with variants in either PON-2 or PON-3 genes.
PMC3499946	R02014	Since BMI and statin use have been shown to potentially affect serum paraoxonase activity11–13, we also adjusted the genetic analyses for these potential confounders.
PMC3499946	R02015	However, the strength of the association of the lead SNPs with paraoxonase and arylesterase activities was not diminished when either BMI or statin use alone was included with age and gender in the genetic models or in a fully adjusted model that included all four covariates (Supplemental Table 2).
PMC3499946	R02016	Thus, the effect of the lead SNPs on paraoxonase and arylesterase activities are robust and independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.
PMC3499946	R03000	Given the strong effect of the chromosome 7 locus on PON-1 function, we also carried out GWAS analyses for paraoxonase and arylesterase activity conditioned on the lead SNP for each respective trait.
PMC3499946	R03002	To gain further insight into the effect of the chromosome 7 variants on PON-1 function, we also examined the relationship between serum paraoxonase and arylesterase activities in our cohort.
PMC3499946	R03005	However, such a pattern was not observed with the three genotype groups of the lead SNP for serum arylesterase activity (rs854572; G>C, Figure 5B).
PMC3499946	R04000	We next sought to determine whether the lead variants influencing paraoxonase and arylesterase activity were associated with the development of MACE.
PMC3499946	R04003	Given the differential effects of the associated variants on PON-1 function (e.g. rs662 is associated with increase in paraoxonase activity but decrease in arylesterase activity), we also constructed haplotypes with rs662, rs854560, rs854570, and rs854572 and specifically tested the ATAG haplotype, which leads to modest decreases in both paraoxonase and arylesterase activity (data not shown).
PMC3501981	A00009	In addition, MCP-1 levels were significantly associated with SNPs in chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) and caspase recruitment domain family, member 9 (CARD9).

PMC3507617	A00009	In conclusion, certain SNPs in MTNR1B and glucokinase demonstrate consistent effects across four racial and ethnic groups, narrowing the putative region for these causal variants.

PMC3607698	D00006	Because our study was designed to test the hypothesis that inheritance might alter response to aromatase inhibitors, and because aromatase inhibitor therapy lowers the already low postmenopausal E2 concentrations studied here, we used a sensitive GC-MS/MS method to assay plasma E2 levels.

PMC3607698	I01001	Specifically, we obtained DNA and plasma before the initiation of aromatase inhibitor therapy to assay circulating E2 levels and to perform a discovery genome-wide association study (GWAS) for polymorphisms associated with plasma E2 concentrations.
PMC3607698	I01002	Of importance is the fact that we used a sensitive gas chromatography negative ionization tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) E2 assay because our study population comprised postmenopausal women who already had decreased circulating E2 concentrations, and we planned to decrease those levels further by aromatase inhibitor therapy.

PMC3723315	A00000	Increased systemic levels of myeloperoxidase (Myeloperoxidase) are associated with the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD).
PMC3723315	A00001	To identify the genetic factors that are associated with circulating Myeloperoxidase levels, we carried out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and a gene-centric analysis in subjects of European ancestry and African Americans (AAs).
PMC3723315	A00002	A locus on chromosome 1q31.1 containing the complement factor H (CFH) gene was strongly associated with serum Myeloperoxidase levels in 9305 subjects of European ancestry (lead SNP rs800292; P = 4.89 × 10−41) and in 1690 AA subjects (rs505102; P = 1.05 × 10−8).
PMC3723315	A00003	Gene-centric analyses in 8335 subjects of European ancestry additionally identified two rare Myeloperoxidase coding sequence variants that were associated with serum Myeloperoxidase levels (rs28730837, P = 5.21 × 10−12; rs35897051, P = 3.32 × 10−8).
PMC3723315	A00004	A GWAS for plasma Myeloperoxidase levels in 9260 European ancestry subjects identified a chromosome 17q22 region near Myeloperoxidase that was significantly associated (lead SNP rs6503905; P = 2.94 × 10−12), but the CFH locus did not exhibit evidence of association with plasma MPO levels.
PMC3723315	A00008	These results suggest that distinct genetic factors regulate serum and plasma Myeloperoxidase levels, which may have relevance for various acute and chronic inflammatory disorders.
PMC3723315	A00009	The clinical implications for CAD and a better understanding of the functional basis for the association of CFH and Myeloperoxidase variants with circulating Myeloperoxidase levels require further study.
PMC3723315	D00000	Using meta-analyses of both GWAS and gene-centric data, we identified distinct loci that were associated with serum and plasma Myeloperoxidase levels.
PMC3723315	D00001	The most significant locus for serum Myeloperoxidase levels in subjects of European ancestry was observed with CFH on chromosome 1, which was replicated in AA subjects.
PMC3723315	D00003	As a result of this different LD pattern, candidate causal SNPs responsible for the association with lower serum Myeloperoxidase levels could include rs505102, rs800292 or another SNP in LD with these variants.
PMC3723315	D00006	However, it is not known whether Myeloperoxidase plays a biological role in these inflammatory diseases.
PMC3723315	D00007	In addition, the association of the other disease-associated CFH variants with serum Myeloperoxidase levels was attenuated when the analyses were conditioned on rs800292, even though these SNPs are in weak LD (r2 < 0.30) with rs800292 in subjects of European ancestry.
PMC3723315	D00008	Thus, while several independent alleles at the CFH locus influence multiple inflammatory-related disease phenotypes, the strong association signal at this locus with serum Myeloperoxidase levels is primarily due to rs800292 or other tightly linked variants.
PMC3723315	D01000	Complement fixation is well known as a potent trigger of leukocyte activation and degranulation, and serum generation is associated with activation of protease cascades, including complement proteins, such as C3a and C3b (31–33).
PMC3723315	D01001	Thus, an association between a genetic variant for a complement protein and serum Myeloperoxidase levels, but not plasma Myeloperoxidase levels, can be mechanistically rationalized and could be related to leukocyte activation and partial degranulation during blood coagulation.
PMC3723315	D01002	A role for the complement system in influencing serum Myeloperoxidase levels is also supported by the results of our gene-centric analyses, which identified an amino acid substitution in C2 (rs9332739) for serum Myeloperoxidase levels that has also been previously associated with AMD (34).
PMC3723315	D01003	The minor alleles of rs800292 in CFH and rs9332739 in C2 protect against the development of AMD and are associated with decreased serum Myeloperoxidase levels.
PMC3723315	D01005	Presumably, this would reduce complement activation and leukocyte activation during serum separation, thereby leading to decreased Myeloperoxidase release from neutrophils and/or monocytes.
PMC3723315	D01006	This notion is consistent with our functional data, showing that the A allele of rs800292, which is associated with decreased Myeloperoxidase levels, is associated with lower serum levels of C3a-desArg, a cleavage product generated by complement activation.
PMC3723315	D01007	In addition, clotting factors and proteases that activate complement proteins and trigger degranulation of MPO-rich phagocytes, such as neutrophils, are present in serum but are mostly depleted in plasma.
PMC3723315	D01008	Therefore, CFH and C2 variants that decrease complement activation, either through increased CFH or reduced C2 activity, could be one potential mechanism through which they lead to decreased Myeloperoxidase levels in serum.
PMC3723315	D02001	Myeloperoxidase variants, including those identified herein, have not been reported to be associated with AMD, meningococcal susceptibility, IgA-induced nephropathy, HUS, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis type II or SLE, suggesting that circulating Myeloperoxidase levels may not play a causal role in the pathogenesis of such inflammatory diseases.
PMC3723315	D02002	On the other hand, MPO-induced oxidative damage to lipoproteins and the vascular wall have been implicated in the development of atherosclerosis and its clinical sequelae, and systemic levels of Myeloperoxidase predict cardiovascular risk.
PMC3723315	D03000	In addition to loci containing genes of the complement system, the region containing SIRPB2 also demonstrated genome-wide significant association with serum Myeloperoxidase levels in subjects of European ancestry.
PMC3723315	D03002	The role of SIRPB2 in antigen-specific proliferation and activation of T-cells (39) may provide an additional biological link for its association with serum Myeloperoxidase levels.
PMC3723315	D03003	By comparison, the gene-centric analyses in AA subjects identified a promoter variant of DARC (rs2814778) that achieved near genome-wide significance for association with serum Myeloperoxidase levels.
PMC3723315	D03005	Thus, this is consistent with our observations that the A allele of rs2814778 is associated with increased serum Myeloperoxidase levels since Myeloperoxidase is most abundantly present in neutrophils.
PMC3723315	D04000	As a comparative analysis, we also carried out a GWAS for plasma Myeloperoxidase levels in subjects of European descent.
PMC3723315	D04001	These results identified multiple SNPs in a large ∼1 Mb interval encompassing Myeloperoxidase on chromosome 17q22 that demonstrated association with both plasma and serum Myeloperoxidase levels.
PMC3723315	D04002	These results are further supported by our gene-centric analyses, which identified rare Myeloperoxidase SNPs that were also associated with serum Myeloperoxidase levels, including the previously reported rs28730837 Ala332Val substitution (9).
PMC3723315	D04003	In contrast, the CFH locus only demonstrated association with Myeloperoxidase levels in serum.
PMC3723315	D04005	However, with the exception of rs6503905, which remained strongly associated with plasma Myeloperoxidase levels after taking into account the effect of rs12940923, the association signals with the remaining SNPs were attenuated in the conditional analyses.
PMC3723315	D04006	Of note, rs12940923 is in relatively strong LD (r2 = 0.67) with a −463 G>A promoter polymorphism (rs2333227) in Myeloperoxidase that has previously been associated with plasma Myeloperoxidase levels (42).
PMC3723315	D04007	The association of rs12940923 and rs6503905 with circulating Myeloperoxidase levels is also supported by the directionally consistent and strong cis eQTLs these variants exhibit with Myeloperoxidase expression, even after conditioning on the lead eQTL SNP.
PMC3723315	D04009	Taken together, these data indicate that several SNPs at chromosome 17q22 contribute independently to circulating Myeloperoxidase levels and suggest that this locus may contain a regulatory region(s) with pleiotropic effects on gene expression.
PMC3723315	D05000	Another interesting observation from our analyses of plasma Myeloperoxidase levels is the suggestive association between circulating Myeloperoxidase levels and variants in the vicinity of GALNT2.
PMC3723315	D05001	For example, an intronic variant (rs2144300) of GALNT2, which we identified in both GWAS and gene-centric analyses for serum Myeloperoxidase levels, has previously been associated with lower HDL levels (43).
PMC3723315	D05002	GALNT2 is involved in protein O-linked glycosylation and, while its role in regulating Myeloperoxidase levels is not immediately evident, it is interesting to note that Myeloperoxidase binds to HDL within atherosclerotic lesions via apolipoprotein A-1 and catalyzes HDL oxidation (44–46), thereby impairing its cardio-protective properties.
PMC3723315	D05003	By comparison, the GWAS for plasma Myeloperoxidase levels identified another SNP (rs12049351) located ∼485 kb proximal to GALNT2 in between ABCB10 and TAF5L that was suggestively associated with plasma Myeloperoxidase levels.
PMC3723315	D05004	Rs12049351 was also associated with serum Myeloperoxidase levels whereas rs2144300 was not associated with plasma Myeloperoxidase levels.
PMC3723315	D05005	These results suggest that specific alleles in this region may control both serum and plasma Myeloperoxidase levels whereas other independent variants are associated with only levels in serum, possibly through a mechanism related to HDL metabolism.
PMC3723315	D06000	While the results of our analyses have revealed potentially interesting loci that control circulating Myeloperoxidase levels, several limitations of our study should be noted.
PMC3723315	D06001	First, circulating Myeloperoxidase levels could be affected by environmental and/or transient factors, such as physical activity or acute infections, which our analyses did not take into account.
PMC3723315	D06003	Furthermore, GeneBank recruited consecutive patients undergoing elective diagnostic coronary angiography, which would enrich for subjects with CAD, and lead to Myeloperoxidase levels that are on average higher compared with the other population-based studies.
PMC3723315	D06004	This could explain, in part, the variation seen in circulating Myeloperoxidase levels across cohorts even when using the same assay, and the observed heterogeneity in the association results for some of the identified loci.
PMC3723315	D07000	In summary, our comprehensive genetic studies on two ethnicities identified several unique loci that are associated with either serum or plasma Myeloperoxidase levels.
PMC3723315	D07001	These results indicate a potentially prominent role for the complement system in influencing serum Myeloperoxidase levels, presumably via leukocyte activation.
PMC3723315	D07002	By comparison, independent variants at the Myeloperoxidase locus were strongly associated with plasma Myeloperoxidase levels but modestly associated with serum levels.
PMC3723315	D07003	Despite the clinical association of both plasma and serum Myeloperoxidase levels with both prevalent cardiovascular phenotypes and incident risk for major adverse cardiac events, genetic variants associated with circulating Myeloperoxidase levels do not show association with history of CAD in ∼80 000 subjects from the CARDIoGRAM consortium.
PMC3723315	D07004	Additional studies will be needed to gain a better understanding of the functional basis for the association between circulating Myeloperoxidase levels and the identified variants in CFH and Myeloperoxidase, as well as to determine the clinical implications for inflammatory diseases that could be mediated in part through MPO-related activity.

PMC3723315	I01002	Candidate gene studies have also identified common variants of Myeloperoxidase that have been associated with CAD as well as circulating Myeloperoxidase levels (16–19).
PMC3723315	I01003	However, a more complete understanding of the genetic factors controlling circulating Myeloperoxidase levels is still lacking.
PMC3723315	I01004	Therefore, the aim of the present study was to use large-scale unbiased genome-wide and targeted gene-centric analyses to identify loci controlling serum and plasma Myeloperoxidase levels and to determine whether MPO-associated variants influence the risk of CAD.
PMC3723315	I01005	To our knowledge, these analyses would represent the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) for circulating Myeloperoxidase levels.
PMC3723315	R00000	We first carried out a meta-analysis of GWAS data for serum Myeloperoxidase levels in 9305 subjects of European ancestry.
PMC3723315	R00002	The observed variability in Myeloperoxidase levels, which could have also been influenced by either sample storage-related effects or acute minor infections at the time of blood collection, made it difficult to harmonize Myeloperoxidase assays across cohorts.
PMC3723315	R00004	The quantile–quantile (Q–Q) and Manhattan plots for serum Myeloperoxidase levels are presented in Figure 1A and B.
PMC3723315	R00007	The characteristics of the lead SNPs at these three loci and their association with serum Myeloperoxidase levels are summarized in Table 2 and Supplementary Material, Table S2.
PMC3723315	R00009	The CFH-CFHR3-CFHR1 genomic region on chromosome 1q31.3 contains several other variants that were also significantly associated with serum Myeloperoxidase levels, which show varying levels of linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs800292 (Fig.
PMC3723315	R01001	The lead SNP (rs3134931; P = 1.49 × 10−8) is located within intron 2 of NOTCH4 and is not in strong LD (r2 < 0.4) with any of the other 130 variants in this region that demonstrate suggestive (P < 5.0 × 10−6) association with serum Myeloperoxidase levels (Fig. 2B).
PMC3723315	R01002	One SNP at chromosome 20p13, which is not in LD (r2 < 0.2) with other variants in this region, was also significantly associated with serum Myeloperoxidase levels (rs6042507; P = 4.30 × 10−8) (Fig.
PMC3723315	R02002	As a result, the gene-centric analyses allowed us to validate and fine map a subset of the loci identified in the GWAS meta-analysis, as well as potentially identify other variants associated with serum Myeloperoxidase levels.
PMC3723315	R03000	As shown in Table 2 and Supplementary Material, Table S4, a strong association of serum Myeloperoxidase levels was observed with variants in CFH where the lead SNPs yielded P-values of 6.65 × 10−43 (rs6680396) and 4.74 × 10−42 (rs505102).
PMC3723315	R03001	The rs6680396 and rs505102 variants are in high LD (r2 = 0.87) with each other in subjects of European descent (based on the 1000 Genome Project CEU data), and also with the lead SNP identified in the GWAS for serum Myeloperoxidase levels (rs800292).
PMC3723315	R03002	A combined analysis of the CFH locus using all available unique individuals in the GWAS and IBC datasets, including the GeneBank cohort (combined n = 10 524), further strengthened the association of rs6680396 with serum Myeloperoxidase levels (P = 9.34 × 10−45).
PMC3723315	R03003	The gene-centric analyses also identified an SNP on chromosome 6p21.32 (rs9332739) in C2 that was strongly associated with serum Myeloperoxidase levels (P = 4.83 × 10−10) (Table 2; Supplementary Material, Table S4).
PMC3723315	R03004	Rs9332739 (MAF = 0.044) encodes a non-synonymous Glu318Asp (GAG>GAC) substitution in C2 and is located ∼287 kb proximal to the lead SNP (rs3134931) in NOTCH4 that was identified in the GWAS for serum Myeloperoxidase levels (Fig.
PMC3723315	R04000	To replicate the association findings observed with serum Myeloperoxidase levels and determine whether the loci have similar effects on other ethnicities, we used IBC SNP array data available in 1690 African Americans (AAs) from the CARDIA (n = 1047) and CHS (n = 643) cohorts.
PMC3723315	R04001	Consistent with the results on subjects of European ancestry, rs505102 in CFH was significantly associated (P = 1.05 × 10−8) with serum Myeloperoxidase levels in AAs (Table 2; Supplementary Material, Table S5), thus providing independent validation of this locus in a different ethnic group.
PMC3723315	R04002	The IBC analyses in AAs also yielded suggestive evidence for association of serum Myeloperoxidase levels with rs2814778 (P = 6.48 × 10−8) (Table 2; Supplementary Material, Table S5), which is located in the 5′ UTR of the Duffy blood group antigen gene (DARC) on chromosome 1q23.3.
PMC3723315	R04004	The association was strongly attenuated (P = 0.02), suggesting that the association of rs2814778 with serum Myeloperoxidase in AAs is largely mediated through the number of circulating neutrophils.
PMC3723315	R04005	In addition to validating the association of CFH with serum Myeloperoxidase levels observed in subjects of European ancestry, there was supportive evidence in AAs for association of serum Myeloperoxidase levels with rs9332739 in C2 (P = 0.0045) and the rare Ala332Val (rs28730837) substitution in MPO (P = 0.061) (Supplementary Material, Table S5), but not with the other variant in MPO (rs35897051; P = 0.93) or with rs2144300 in GALNT2 (P = 0.77).
PMC3723315	R05000	We next carried out a GWAS meta-analysis for plasma Myeloperoxidase levels in subjects of European ancestry from the GeneBank, Gutenberg Health Study (GHS), and Ludwigshafen Risk and Cardiovascular Health (LURIC) cohorts (total n = 9260).
PMC3723315	R05001	The Q–Q and Manhattan plots for the plasma Myeloperoxidase analyses are shown in Figure 3A and B, and the genomic control factors were 0.999, 1.008, 0.980, 0.970 and 0.991 for the GeneBank (n = 2191), GHS I (n = 2997), GHS II (n = 1178), LURIC1 (n = 794) and LURIC2 cohorts (n = 2100), respectively.
PMC3723315	R05002	The most significant locus for plasma Myeloperoxidase levels mapped to chromosome 17q22 near Myeloperoxidase with the lead SNP (rs6503905) yielding a P-value of 2.94 × 10−12 (Fig.
PMC3723315	R06000	In addition to the chromosome 17q22 locus, we also observed suggestive evidence for association of plasma Myeloperoxidase levels with the region surrounding GALNT2 (Fig.
PMC3723315	R07004	To further evaluate the functional effects of SNPs associated with circulating Myeloperoxidase levels, we used previously generated microarray data in monocytes from 1467 subjects in the GHS I and II cohorts (20).
PMC3723315	R07005	Significant and directionally consistent cis eQTLs were observed with SNPs located on chromosome 17q22 and mRNA levels of Myeloperoxidase as well as several other genes in this region, including RAD51C, SEPT4 and TRIM37 (Table 3).
PMC3723315	R07006	For Myeloperoxidase and RAD51C, these associations remained significant even after conditioning on the lead eQTL SNPs, which suggest that this region may have pleiotropic effects on the expression of multiple genes.
PMC3723315	R07007	No significant eQTL associations were detected with SNPs at other loci that were associated with serum or plasma Myeloperoxidase levels, including the CFH locus on chromosome 1.
PMC3723315	R08000	To further investigate the significance of the loci for circulating Myeloperoxidase levels, we evaluated the association of the identified SNPs with prevalent CAD using the CARDIoGRAM consortium.

PMC3756935	D01004	In addition, the MERTK and TULP1 proteins have been shown to interact during the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells.36 In particular, mice lacking specifically the murine homolog of MERTK display a deficiency in the clearance of apoptotic thymocytes by macrophages.37 Interestingly, the clearance of apoptotic debris by phagocytosis can directly stimulate fibrogenesis.38,39 Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) may play a key role in this process, as they have phagocytic functions, including the NADPH oxidase activity required for the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).40 HSC are also found in close proximity to hepatocytes, a key source of apoptotic debris during liver injury.41 Overall, our results suggest a possible relationship between the clearance of apoptotic cells through phagocytosis and liver fibrosis.

PMC3760420	R01003	Although there were no associations reaching genome-wide levels of significance with LDL diameter response to fenofibrate, the top three loci were in the jumonji domain containing 1C isoform a (JMJD1C) gene (P=1.81 × 10−6), the phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10) gene (P=2.01 × 10−6) and near the neurexophilin-1 (NXPH1) gene (P=1.45 × 10−06).
PMC3760995	D04000	One of the previous candidate gene studies of rate of decline in AD cases identified SNP rs1868402 in a gene that encodes the regulatory sub-unit of protein phosphatase B (PPP3R1) that was not associated with risk for AD or age at onset, but was associated with rate of decline as measured by the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDR-SB) and also tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 (ptau181) levels measured in CSF, a known biomarker for AD.12

PMC3773907	D02002	Specifically, both the HLA and SERPINA1 associations with granulomatosis with polyangiitis are seen in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis who are positive for proteinase 3 ANCA, not for myeloperoxidase ANCA, and can also be seen in the proteinase 3 ANCA subgroup of patients with microscopic polyangiitis.
PMC3773907	D02004	The genetic difference between proteinase 3–ANCA and myeloperoxidase-ANCA polyangiitis could have immunopathogenic and therapeutic implications (see below as well as Suppiah et al.27 and Stegeman28), and will require future genetic studies powered to detect associations with these conditions rather than with ANCA-associated vasculitis as a whole.
PMC3773907	D03000	Although increasing evidence suggested that proteinase 3 ANCA is important in the pathogenesis of ANCA-associated vasculitis, the possibility that it was an epiphenomenon remained.
PMC3773907	D03001	There is strong in vitro evidence that ANCA can bind to neutrophils and drive endothelial inflammation,29 and proteinase 3 ANCA has induced vasculitis, but not granulomata, in transfer studies in mice.20 Proteinase 3 expression is increased on neutrophils in patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis,30 and pathogenic mechanisms for its involvement have been suggested.31 One small study has also suggested a genetic association, though this was not replicated.32 Our study shows that variants at the MHC, SERPINA1, and PRTN3 loci confer a significant risk of proteinase 3–ANCA polyangiitis.
PMC3773907	D03003	Nonetheless, this firm association between key components of the autoimmune response — MHC, the proteinase 3 autoantigen itself, and perhaps α1-antitrypsin — puts anti–proteinase 3 autoreactivity at the center of the cause of disease, potentially resolving a long-standing controversy.
PMC3773907	D04000	Proteinase 3–ANCA polyangiitis, which is the antibody subtype of two thirds of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and one third of those with microscopic polyangiitis, is a condition in which there is genetic variation in an autoantigen itself, together with HLA, implying that antigen-specific autoimmunity plays a role in pathogenesis.
PMC3773907	D05000	SERPINA1 encodes α1-antitrypsin, a neutral serine protease inhibitor, enzymatic targets of which include proteinase 3.
PMC3773907	D06000	We found myeloperoxidase-ANCA polyangiitis to be associated with a SNP in HLA-DQ.
PMC3773907	D06001	This subgroup analysis had reduced power (Fig. S4 in the Supplementary Appendix) and it is possible that larger studies will uncover more variants associated with myeloperoxidase ANCA.
PMC3773907	D06002	These data raise the possibility that, like proteinase 3–ANCA polyangiitis and consistent with in vitro and animal-model evidence,19 myeloperoxidase-ANCA polyangiitis might be driven by antimy-eloperoxidase autoimmunity.
PMC3773907	D07000	Despite having distinct genetic risk factors, proteinase 3–ANCA and myeloperoxidase-ANCA polyangiitis have overlapping clinical phenotypes.
PMC3773907	D07002	This would be consistent with the similar proinflammatory effects of proteinase 3 ANCA and myeloperoxidase ANCA in vitro38,39 and upon transfer in animal models.19,20
PMC3773907	D07003	This clinical similarity between proteinase 3 ANCA and myeloperoxidase ANCA disease is likely to be augmented by shared genetic associations, which are commonly seen between distinct autoimmune diseases.40 Differences between the syndromes could be caused by additional independent genetic associations that this study has not been powered to detect.
PMC3773907	D08002	Moreover, the fact that proteinase 3–ANCA and myeloperoxidase-ANCA polyangiitis have distinct genetic causes suggests that clinical trials that have considered ANCA-associated vasculitis as a single entity must be interpreted carefully, since subsets defined by ANCA specificity may respond differently to therapeutic intervention.
PMC3773907	D08003	Future genetic and clinical studies of ANCA-associated vasculitis should be sufficiently powered to allow for independent analysis of proteinase 3–ANCA and myeloperoxidase-ANCA polyangiitis.

PMC3773907	I00001	Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is characterized by granulomatous inflammation of the respiratory tract and by autoantibodies against the neutrophil granule serine protease proteinase 3 in 66% of patients (considered to have proteinase 3 ANCA–associated vasculitis) or against another neutrophil granule component, myeloperoxidase, in 24% of patients (considered to have myeloperoxidase ANCA–associated vasculitis).4 Microscopic polyangiitis is associated with myeloperoxidase ANCA in 58% of cases and with proteinase 3 ANCA in 26% of cases.4 Some patients are ANCA-negative,4 as are more than 50% of patients with the uncommon Churg–Strauss syndrome.5
PMC3773907	I01001	The most convincing association has been with the major histocompatibility complex (MHC),7-9 especially the locus HLA DPB1*0401.10 An association has been suggested between ANCA-associated vasculitis and the rare Z (or null) allele of the serpin A1 gene (SERPINA1), which encodes α1-antitrypsin, a serine proteinase inhibitor for which proteinase 3 is one of several substrates.
PMC3773907	I03001	In vitro evidence suggests that ANCA can be proinflammatory, and transfer models of myeloperoxidase ANCA and proteinase 3 ANCA in animals mimic some aspects of disease.19,20 Thus, proteinase 3 ANCA and myeloperoxidase ANCA are potentially important in pathogenesis but nonetheless might represent epiphenomena rather than drivers of disease.
PMC3773907	R01003	Three additional SNPs not represented on the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Platform were included: the interleukin-2–receptor alpha gene (IL2RA) and the protein tyrosine phosphatase, nonreceptor type 22 gene (PTPN22) because of prior associations and the proteinase 3 gene (PRTN3) because it is a major ANCA autoantigen.
PMC3773907	R01004	(The other major ANCA autoantigen, myeloperoxidase, was already represented on the array.)
PMC3773907	R04000	Further subgroup analysis was performed according to proteinase 3– and myeloperoxidase-ANCA specificity.
PMC3773907	R05000	Direct comparisons between the subgroup of patients with proteinase 3 ANCA and the subgroup with myeloperoxidase ANCA showed significant differences at the MHC, SERPINA1, and PRTN3 loci, all consisting of there being a genetic association with proteinase 3 ANCA but not myeloper-oxidase ANCA (Table 2 and Fig.
PMC3773907	R05002	In all cases, both the odds ratios and P values show a stronger association with proteinase 3 ANCA than with granulomatosis with polyangiitis.
PMC3773907	R05003	This was particularly clear for PRTN3, which was conclusively associated with proteinase 3 ANCA status whereas it had not been with total ANCA-associated vasculitis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Table 2).
PMC3773907	R06000	We repeated the whole genomewide association analysis in patient cohorts defined by ANCA specificity; this revealed no new associations with the proteinase 3 ANCA subgroup but one — a SNP in HLA-DQ — with the myeloperoxidase ANCA subgroup (Table 2 and Fig.
PMC3773907	R06002	This SNP was not convincingly associated with proteinase 3 ANCA, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or microscopic polyangiitis in this cohort.
PMC3773907	R06003	However, after genotyping by means of a TaqMan assay in the replication cohort, it reached “genomewide” significance with the myeloperoxidase ANCA subgroup (odds ratio, 0.65; P = 2.1×10−8 in the combined cohort) (Table 2).
PMC3773907	R07003	Within the granulomatosis with polyangiitis subgroup, the associations of HLA-DP and the related SNPs SERPINA1 and PRTN3 were seen in the patients with proteinase 3 ANCA, not in those with myeloperoxidase ANCA (Table 3).
PMC3773907	R07004	In the microscopic polyangiitis group, the sub-groups were much smaller, but the findings were the same: an association of proteinase 3 ANCA and the HLA-DP SNP and SERPINA1.
PMC3773907	R07005	The converse was true for the HLA-DQ SNP, which was associated with myeloperoxidase ANCA rather than proteinase 3 ANCA among patients with microscopic polyangiitis (Table 3).
PMC3773907	R08000	The most prominent non-MHC association with both the proteinase 3 ANCA and granulomatosis with polyangiitis subgroups was found at SNP rs7151526, located in the SERPINA1–SERPINA11 locus at 14q32.

PMC4116060	D03003	NKCC2, organized in parallel with the renal outer medullary K+ (ROMK) channel, which is essential to recycle K+. Na+ and Cl− are transported across the basolateral membrane via the Na+/K+-ATPase and the Cl− channel ClC-Kb, respectively.
PMC4116060	D03004	These transport processes are highly regulated: the Ste20- and SPS1-related proline and alanine-rich kinase (SPS1-related proline and alanine-rich kinase) and oxidative stress-responsive kinase (OSR1) activate NKCC2 by N-terminal phosphorylation.27
PMC4116060	D03005	In turn, SPS1-related proline and alanine-rich kinase and OSR1 require regulatory cofactors, such as sorting protein-related receptor with A-type repeats 1 (SORL1) and calcium-binding protein 39 (CAB39).
PMC4116060	D03006	CAB39 is a scaffolding protein that interacts with SPS1-related proline and alanine-rich kinase and OSR1, increasing kinase activation.28 SORL1 was previously shown to mediate SPS1-related proline and alanine-rich kinase membrane sorting, allowing the phosphorylation of NKCC2 by SPAK.29 The fact that uromodulin expression is limited to the TAL segment in mice and humans30–32 and the enrichment of ROMK, SORL1, and CAB39 in that very segment emphasize the potential link between transport processes and uromodulin secretion in the cells lining the TAL.

PMC4119402	A00003	We observed significant haplotype association signals at three previously implicated Parkinson loci: LRRK2 (OR = 12.05, P = 1.23 × 10−56), MAPT (OR = 0.62, P = 1.78 × 10−11) and glucocerebrosidase (multiple distinct haplotypes, OR > 8.28, P = 1.13 × 10−11 and OR = 2.50, P = 1.22 × 10−9).
PMC4119402	D00000	We have identified genome-wide significant haplotypes at LRRK2, glucocerebrosidase, MAPT and chr2q14.3 loci, ranging in size from 40 to 800 kb.

PMC4119402	D01007	On the other hand, a recent study reported an association hit in Europeans [OR = 1.67 (1.50, 1.84), P = 5.7 × 10−9] related to the nearby SYT11 gene (5), close to glucocerebrosidase but apparently independent of the mutations in glucocerebrosidase in Europeans.
PMC4119402	D03003	DASH was able to dissect the signal at the glucocerebrosidase locus into distinct groups of haplotypes that carry distinct mutations and provide initial evidence that multiple causal variants might also be present at the BST1 locus.

PMC4119402	I01004	Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene occur in 13.7–17.9% of Ashkenazi cases and 4.2–6.3% controls, compared with 5 and <1% of non-Jewish European cases and controls (12,16–18).
PMC4119402	I02003	Both approaches identify three genome-wide significant loci: LRRK2, MAPT and glucocerebrosidase.
PMC4119402	R03000	We captured a genome-wide significant association signal at the glucocerebrosidase locus [rs1630500, OR = 1.75 (1.43, 2.15), P = 2.12 × 10−8, Fig. 2C].

PMC4119402	R03007	After conditioning on the glucocerebrosidase mutation carrier status (Supplementary Material, Methods), we did not observe any residual association signal at the glucocerebrosidase locus.
PMC4119402	R10003	The frequency of glucocerebrosidase mutation carriers was 17.6% in the combined sample, with significant heterogeneity between centers (12.0, 16.7 and 20.2%, P = 0.021), and not significantly different from the previously published frequency range of 13.7–17.9% (12,18), although again some samples overlapped between this and the earlier study.
PMC4119402	R11000	LRRK2 and glucocerebrosidase mutation carriers have an earlier AAO than non-carriers (mean ± SD, 56.4 ± 11.7 and 54.0 ± 11.3%, respectively, compared with 60.6 ± 11.6%, logrank P = 1.2 × 10−5, Supplementary Material, Fig. S6B).
PMC4119402	R11001	Familial cases are enriched in LRRK2 mutation carriers (29.1% of familial cases carry p.G2019S, P = 7.15 × 10−9), comparable to the previously published estimate of 26%, but are not enriched in glucocerebrosidase carriers.
PMC4119402	R11002	We did not observe evidence in support of a gender effect for either LRRK2 (P = 0.098) or glucocerebrosidase (P = 0.70), and there was no difference in AAO between males and females (P = 0.97), nor between familial and sporadic cases (P = 0.27, Kaplan–Meier curves are shown in Supplementary Material, Fig. S6).
PMC4119402	R14001	At the BST1 locus—similar to what we observed at the glucocerebrosidase locus—there was more than one distinct group of haplotypes carrying the variants that increase the risk of PD: chr4:14 997 475–15 727 723

PMC4321444	D03001	Unlike BHMT, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase-2 cannot use betaine (28), thus we hypothesize that the causal gene in this region is betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase.
PMC4321444	D03002	Given three fungible sources of methyl groups (Fig. 1), it is unlikely that variants in betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase alter Se levels through a mechanism downstream of Met generation but rather through a mechanism specific to betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase.
PMC4321444	D03003	Se can react with cysteine-rich regions present within the catalytic domain of enzymes such as protein kinase C where it may form selenenyl-sulfide bonds with cysteines resulting in lower enzyme activities (29).
PMC4321444	D03004	As betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase is a zinc-dependent cysteine-rich enzyme, an altered thiol redox status could influence its activity in much the same way as for protein kinase C (30).
PMC4321444	D05006	Regarding the latter, we note that unlike genetic variation in the folate-dependent pathway, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase variation does not appear to impact Hcy levels (10,11,40–42) and together suggests a less dominant role of the BHMT/2 remethylation pathway in human Hcy balance, a theory which contrasts that proposed for mice (39).

PMC4354842	A00007	In the 2q14 region, the top SNPs were near or within the protein C gene: rs7580658 (β = 0.15
PMC4354842	A00010	These two SNPs were in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with another SNP rs1158867 that resides in a biochemically functional site and in weak to strong LD with the top protein C variants previously reported in individuals of European descent.
PMC4354842	A00011	In addition, two variants outside the protein C region were significantly and independently associated with protein C levels: rs4321325 in CYP27C1 and rs13419716 in MYO7B.
PMC4354842	A00012	In summary, this first GWA study for plasma protein C levels in African Americans confirms the associations of SNPs in the protein C and PROCR regions with circulating levels of protein C across ethnic populations and identifies new candidates for protein C regulation.
PMC4354842	D00001	The top SNPs from the 79 significant markers were found in the protein C and the PROCR genes or nearby regions that are in LD with markers in these genes.
PMC4354842	D00002	Our GWAS in African Americans not only replicated the protein C and the PROCR loci reported from the previously published GWAS or candidate gene studies in individuals of European descent [Aiach et al., 1999; Athanasiadis et al., 2011; Oudot-Mellakh et al., 2012; Pomp et al., 2009; Reiner et al., 2008;
PMC4354842	D01003	In addition, the largest one, based on 8,048 individuals of the ARIC, reported additional signals at protein C (top SNP rs1158867), EDEM2 (rs6120849), and GCKR (rs1260326) [Tang et al., 2010].

PMC4354842	D02000	Rs867186 is a missense mutation in the PROCR gene that encodes a receptor for activated protein C, endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), which is an N-glycosylated type I membrane protein.
PMC4354842	D04000	The top 2 SNPs at 2q14, rs7580658 and rs1799808, are in high LD (r2=0.78) and showed similar strength of association with protein C. While they were not the top protein C variants previously reported in the GWAS of ARIC European Americans (rs1158867 and rs1799810), they were in LD with these variants (r2=0.65 ~ 0.22) and were significant in ARIC European Americans (rs7580658: p=2.10×10−14; rs1799808: p=6.03×10−17).
PMC4354842	D04002	These data suggest that the associations observed at the protein C region across the different ethnic populations were attributable to the same underlying locus.
PMC4354842	D05003	While the effect size and allele frequency for rs867186 in PROCR were similar between these two ethnic groups, we noticed that at the protein C region, the frequency of protein C-increasing allele (A1 in European Americans and A2 in African Americans) was two times higher in European Americans than in African Americans.
PMC4354842	D06000	In the protein C region, novel SNPs (rs4321325 in CYP27C1 and rs13419716 in MYO7B) remained significantly associated with protein C after adjustment for the top SNPs (rs7580658 and rs1799808).
PMC4354842	D06004	Also, LD between the secondary variants and the top protein C SNPs was lower in HapMap YRI (r2=0.006~0.014) than in CEU populations (r2=0.08~0.09).
PMC4354842	D07003	These biochemically functional genomic sites include transcription factor binding sites and chromatin access sites, i.e. DNAase I hypersensitive sites[Dunham et al., 2012].

PMC4354842	I00006	Plasma levels of protein C in individuals of European descent are influenced by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in or near the protein C and PROCR genes [Aiach et al., 1999; Athanasiadis et al., 2011; Oudot-Mellakh et al., 2012;
PMC4354842	R02002	The strongest signal was observed for rs7580658, an intergenic SNP that was 16,735 bp upstream of the 5′ terminus of the protein C (protein C) gene.
PMC4354842	R03000	The second top SNP associated with protein C was rs1799808, 5′ to the protein C gene.
PMC4354880	D00008	Fifth, genetic variation in genes encoding renin and the aldosterone synthase, respectively, was not related to plasma renin concentration or activity or to aldosterone levels.
PMC4354880	D01001	The kininogen 1 gene encodes both high and low molecular weight kininogen, the precursors of bradykinin and kallidin (Lys-Bradykinin), respectively.27 The kallikrein B gene encodes plasma prekallikrein, a serine protease that, upon transformation to kallikrein, catalyzes the conversion of high molecular weight kininogen to bradykinin (Figure 5)27 and possibly other factors such as adrenomedullin and endothelin-1.28
PMC4354880	D03000	These observations are consistent with the concept that the kallikrein-kinin system and the RAAS are tightly interrelated.29 A prime example for this interaction is the angiotensin-converting enzyme (angiotensin-converting enzyme), which catalyzes on one hand the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and on the other hand, degrades bradykinin.29-30
PMC4354880	D03001	In other words, the angiotensin-converting enzyme affects the concentrations of key effectors of the RAAS (i.e. angiotensin II) and the kallikrein-kinin system, (i.e. bradykinin) in opposite directions.
PMC4354880	D06000	In prior studies, genetic variation in the renin (REN) gene itself has been associated with plasma renin activity35-36 and the risk of incident hypertension.35-36 On a parallel note, genetic variation in the CYP11B2 gene, which encodes the aldosterone synthase (MIM 124080), has been related to the ratio of plasma aldosterone concentration/plasma renin activity.37 In our analyses, however, a limited number of SNPs in these two genes were not associated with plasma renin concentration, plasma renin activity or circulating aldosterone levels, respectively.
PMC4354880	D07002	Gαs is a stimulatory G-protein subunit activating the adenylate cyclase, which – upon such activation – increases intracellular cAMP levels.39-41 cAMP is an important second messenger binding e.g. to PKA, which in turn influences the transcription of multiple genes.40-41 As reviewed in detail by Kim et al., the Gαs/cAMP/PKA pathway plays a central role in the regulation of renin secretion, one of the key biomarkers of the RAAS.42 Mice with targeted deletion of Gαs in juxtaglomerular cells display lower basal renin secretion and expression42 and a blunted response to chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition or AT1 receptor blockade (impaired “feedback loop”),43 indicating that Gαs signaling is highly relevant to renin secretion and expression under steady-state and dynamic conditions.42
PMC4354880	D08000	Co-administration of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or AT1 antagonists with inhibitors of the adenylate cyclase likewise substantially reduces renin expression as compared to ACE-inhibitors or AT1 antagonists alone.42-43 Thus, cell-specific disruption of the Gαs gene in juxtaglomerular cells and inhibition of the adenylate cyclase leads to impaired renin secretion in response to chronic blockade of the RAAS.42-43

PMC4382867	A07001	In the conventional logistic regression analysis, the SNP rs2965667 at chromosome 12p12.3 near the microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 (MGST1) gene showed a genome-wide significant interaction with aspirin and/or NSAID use (P for interaction=4.6×10-9).
PMC4382867	D01000	These SNPs are 927 kb to 971 kb downstream from microsomal glutathione S-transferase 1 (MGST1) (Supplementary Figure 3), a member of the superfamily of Membrane-associated Proteins in Eicosanoid and Glutathione metabolism (MAPEG).
PMC4382867	D01001	MGST1 has high sequence homology to prostaglandin E synthase (MGST1L1), another homologue of the MAPEG family that shares 38% of its DNA sequences with MGST1.16 MGST1 and MGST1L1 are upregulated in several cancers, including colorectal cancer.17,18 MGST1L1 is coexpressed and functionally coupled to prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (PTGS2/COX-2), and the combined activity of MGST1L1 and COX-2 increases production of proinflammatory prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which promotes carcinogenesis through several mechanisms, including stimulation of WNT signaling, an essential oncogenic pathway of colorectal cancer.19-22 An in vitro experiment has demonstrated that NSAIDs can inhibit expression of MGST1L1 and COX-2, thereby blocking COX-2 mediated synthesis of PGE2 in human colon carcinoma cells.23 Taken together, both MGST1L1 and the closely related gene MGST1 may influence NSAID-mediated inhibition of colorectal carcinogenesis partially through involvement in the PGE2-induced WNT signaling pathway.
PMC4382867	D03000	Rs2965667 is also located about 970 kb upstream from phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit type 2 gamma (PIK3C2G) (Supplementary Figure 3).

PMC4459389	A00010	The ways in which aminolevulinic acid dehydratase variation affects lead uptake or distribution are still to be determined.
PMC4459389	D00000	After combining results from our UK and Australian studies, we found significant allelic associations for blood lead on chromosome 9 at aminolevulinic acid dehydratase.
PMC4459389	D01001	Aminolevulinate dehydratase (E.C. 4.2.1.24) converts delta-aminolevulinic acid to porphobilinogen, an essential early step in the synthesis of porphyrins and haem.
PMC4459389	D01003	Lead inhibits aminolevulinic acid dehydratase activity, and measurement of erythrocyte aminolevulinic acid dehydratase has been used as a biomarker of lead exposure (38).
PMC4459389	D01004	There have been many studies of the relationship between aminolevulinic acid dehydratase polymorphisms and blood or bone lead concentration (summarized in 29 and 30).
PMC4459389	D01005	Other papers suggest that aminolevulinic acid dehydratase polymorphisms modify the relationship between either lead exposure or blood lead, and various neurological or haematological aspects of lead toxicity.
PMC4459389	D01006	These previous studies have focussed on the non-synonymous coding SNP rs1800435, Lys59Asn (which they usually refer to as aminolevulinic acid dehydratase 1/2).
PMC4459389	D01007	A meta-analysis by Zhao et al. (30) suggested a small effect of aminolevulinic acid dehydratase 1/2 on blood lead, while Scinicariello et al. (29) suggested that the effect is only seen in lead-exposed subjects.
PMC4459389	D01008	However, although our data show highly significant association with blood lead at the aminolevulinic acid dehydratase locus, we find far less evidence of association for this non-synonymous coding SNP despite our large sample size and consistency of results across two populations (in Australia and UK).
PMC4459389	D02000	SNP effects are often postulated to affect gene expression; data from blood cells or liver show associations between genotype and aminolevulinic acid dehydratase expression for the most significant SNP in our results (rs1805313), among others.
PMC4459389	D02001	One possible model is that these SNPs affect aminolevulinic acid dehydratase concentration in the erythrocytes; aminolevulinic acid dehydratase binds lead; so the SNPs affect erythrocyte lead concentration.
PMC4459389	D02002	However, the pattern of SNP associations with aminolevulinic acid dehydratase expression across the nearby region is inconsistent with this explanation, because a cluster of SNPs extending across RGS3 and not in linkage disequilibrium with rs1805313 show equally strong association with aminolevulinic acid dehydratase expression but not blood lead (see Fig. 2).
PMC4459389	D02003	One caveat is that the aminolevulinic acid dehydratase expression data are derived from studies on peripheral blood cells, and it is possible that effects on expression in the erythrocyte precursors may differ.
PMC4459389	D02004	Other explanations are possible, but the metabolic step catalysed by aminolevulinic acid dehydratase has no obvious connection with lead uptake or accumulation.
PMC4459389	D03000	Although aminolevulinic acid dehydratase is the first gene to consider in relation to our SNP association findings, it is not the only candidate.
PMC4459389	D04000	It is important to consider whether variation at aminolevulinic acid dehydratase affects the whole-body burden of lead, or only the erythrocyte results.
PMC4459389	D04001	The aminolevulinic acid dehydratase result may mean that some people are more likely to suffer lead toxicity because the polymorphism leads to higher blood lead levels.
PMC4459389	D04002	Alternatively, these people could paradoxically be more resistant to lead toxicity (for a given blood lead level) because the lead is bound to aminolevulinic acid dehydratase and not available to damage neural or erythrocyte-precursor tissues.
PMC4459389	D04004	At present, and pending further data, we cannot be sure whether rs1805313 and other variants near aminolevulinic acid dehydratase affect whole-body lead burden and lead-related risk.
PMC4459389	D07004	In view of the suggestions in published meta-analyses that allelic effects at aminolevulinic acid dehydratase may be greater in occupationally exposed people, and in children, effects of rs1805313 should be checked in these groups.

PMC4459389	R03002	In contrast, rs8177812 at the aminolevulinic acid dehydratase locus, which is in partial LD with rs1805313 (r2 = 0.406, D′ = 1), was non-significant in the unadjusted analysis (Pmeta = 0.935), but showed suggestive evidence for association after conditioning on rs1805313 (Pmeta = 2.27 × 10−6; Supplementary Material, Fig. S3).

PMC4492197	A00001	Our objective was to use a genome-wide approach to identify loci associated with asparaginase hypersensitivity in children with ALL enrolled on St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (SJCRH) protocols Total XIIIA (n = 154), Total XV (n = 498), and Total XVI (n = 271), or Children’s Oncology Group protocols POG 9906 (n = 222) and AALL0232 (n = 2163).
PMC4492197	A00006	The strongest risk factors for asparaginase allergy are variants within genes regulating the immune response.
PMC4492197	D00000	Asparaginase is a mainstay in the treatment of ALL, but immune responses to asparaginase can decrease the systemic exposure to asparaginase and result in a higher risk of relapse.2
PMC4492197	D00001	In this study, we used a genome-wide association approach to identify genetic loci associated with asparaginase hypersensitivity within a racially diverse set of pediatric patients with ALL.
PMC4492197	D00002	We found that the rs6021191 variant is associated with a higher risk of asparaginase hypersensitivity at the genome-wide significance level (Figure 1A-B), and the variant is associated with higher NFATC2 messenger RNA expression (Figure 2A-B).
PMC4492197	D00003	The NFATC2 variant was rare in patients of European ancestry (supplemental Table 3); nevertheless, we were able to identify the association between the NFATC2 variant and asparaginase hypersensitivity because a multiethnic cohort was available for our investigation.
PMC4492197	D01002	Nevertheless, several studies using NFAT inhibitors for different immune-related disease models support that inhibition of the NFAT pathway can attenuate an immune response.27-32 Moreover, among individuals with Down syndrome, the inhibition of the NFAT pathway (partly via overexpression of DYRK1A and DSCR1 due to trisomy 21)33,34 is hypothesized to be related to the cardiac, neurologic, and immunologic defects associated with Down syndrome,34 and individuals with Down syndrome may have attenuated antibody responses to several vaccine antigens.35 Based on this role of the NFAT pathway in Down syndrome, and on our finding of a higher incidence of asparaginase hypersensitivity among those carrying the NFATC2 variant, we hypothesized that Down syndrome patients might have a lower incidence of asparaginase hypersensitivity.
PMC4492197	D01003	Indeed, we observed a lower incidence of asparaginase hypersensitivity among ALL patients with Down syndrome than in those without Down syndrome (6% vs 17%, P multivariate = 8.4 × 10−3; supplemental Figure 4), and this effect was found among protocols using either preparation of asparaginase, with 8% (4 of 48) of patients with Down syndrome having allergic reactions to PEGylated E coli asparaginase compared to 12% of patients without Down syndrome, and 0% (0 of 22) of patients with Down syndrome having allergic reactions to native E
PMC4492197	D01004	coli asparaginase compared with 37% among patients without Down syndrome.
PMC4492197	D01005	These results further support the notion that variability in NFATC2 plays a role in the risk of allergy to asparaginase, and that inhibition of NFATC2 might mitigate sensitization to asparaginase.
PMC4492197	D02002	However, the patients included in our candidate gene study were solely of European ancestry (supplemental Table 1), and the current study extends our previous report identifying HLA-DBRB1*07:01 as a risk allele for asparaginase hypersensitivity by showing that HLA-DRB1*07:01 is also a risk allele in non-European patients (supplemental Figure 3).
PMC4492197	D02003	Furthermore, we show that the association between the HLA-DRB1 rs17885382 variant is independent from the NFATC2 rs6021191 variant and that patients carrying both alleles have a higher risk of developing asparaginase hypersensitivity compared with patients with no risk alleles or with a single risk allele (Figure 3).
PMC4492197	D02004	Interestingly, the GRIA1 rs4958351 variant that we previously found to associate with asparaginase hypersensitivity6 was also associated with the risk of asparaginase hypersensitivity in our combined patient cohort (P = .03; OR = 1.2).

PMC4492197	D03000	In conclusion, we have identified that the NFATC2 rs6021191 variant is an eQTL that is associated with the risk of developing asparaginase hypersensitivity.
PMC4492197	D03002	Moreover, the results from our single SNP and pathway analyses suggest that T cells play an important role in the development of asparaginase hypersensitivity, likely due to their role in B-cell activation and differentiation.

PMC4492197	I00000	Current acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and lymphoma therapies depend heavily upon the use of glucocorticoids and asparaginase, among other drugs.
PMC4492197	I00001	Asparaginase is a heterologous enzyme that can influence the exposure of other drugs, including glucocorticoids.1 Moreover, allergy to asparaginase can compromise the effectiveness of both asparaginase and dexamethasone by decreasing plasma exposure to both agents, and can result in a higher risk of relapse.2 Hypersensitivity reactions to asparaginase during treatment are common, and have been associated with anti-asparaginase immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies rather than IgE antibodies.3,4
PMC4492197	I00002	However, recent reports indicate that patients receiving PEGylated Escherichia coli asparaginase can develop hypersensitivity reactions to the drug without any evidence of detectable antibodies; because IgE may be bound to mast cells and may be present for only a limited time period, it is possible that IgE plays a role in asparaginase-induced reactions but eludes detection.5
PMC4492197	I00003	Therefore, multiple pathways of asparaginase hypersensitivity are possible and currently they are not well understood.
PMC4492197	I01000	Few studies have investigated genetic risk factors for asparaginase hypersensitivity.
PMC4492197	I01001	In a study of 485 pediatric ALL patients on St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (SJCRH) Total XV, the rs4958351 variant in the glutamate receptor gene GRIA1 was associated with asparaginase hypersensitivity.6
PMC4492197	I01002	Our recent study investigating the role of HLA-DRB1 genes on asparaginase hypersensitivity in 1870 patients of European ancestry identified an association with the HLA-DRB1*07:01 allele.7 However, additional agnostic genome-wide studies that encompass the racial diversity of patients with ALL are required to better understand the risk and the mechanisms of asparaginase hypersensitivity.
PMC4492197	I02000	The present study is the largest investigation of genetic predispositions to asparaginase hypersensitivity and includes 3308 patients of diverse ancestry.
PMC4492197	I02001	We used a genome-wide association approach, including a focus on exonic variants in addition to noncoding variants, to identify genetic loci associated with asparaginase hypersensitivity.
PMC4492197	R00000	Hypersensitivity reaction data to native E coli asparaginase or PEGylated E coli asparaginase were available from a total of 3308 pediatric ALL patients enrolled on 5 different protocols (Table 1).
PMC4492197	R01000	A total of 589 patients had asparaginase hypersensitivity reactions (17.8%; Table 2).
PMC4492197	R01001	By univariate analysis both treatment protocol (P = 2.1 × 10−51; Table 2) and asparaginase formulation (P = 2.1 × 10−50; Table 2) were associated with hypersensitivity.
PMC4492197	R01002	Protocols including native E coli asparaginase had a higher frequency of hypersensitivity than those using PEGylated E coli asparaginase (35.1% vs 11.6%; Table 2).
PMC4492197	R01004	In multivariate analysis including treatment protocol, gender, age group, ancestry, and ALL lineage (Table 2), only protocol (P = 2.3 × 10−46), gender (P = .04), and ALL lineage (P = .003) were associated with asparaginase hypersensitivity.
PMC4492197	R01005	Patients with T-cell ALL were only enrolled on SJCRH protocols; within the standard/high-risk arms of these studies, there were more asparaginase hypersensitivity reactions among patients with B-lineage compared with those with T-cell ALL receiving identical treatment (supplemental Figure 1; P = .001).
PMC4492197	R01006	Asparaginase preparation was confounded with protocol, but it also associated with hypersensitivity in multivariate analysis (P = 7.2 × 10−45) when removing protocol as a covariate from the regression model.
PMC4492197	R02000	To identify genomic variants associated with asparaginase hypersensitivity, a multivariate logistic regression model adjusted for treatment arm, ancestry (as a categorical covariate), gender, age, and ALL lineage was used.
PMC4492197	R02002	Focusing on nonsynonymous SNPs, the minor allele at rs17885382 in the HLA-DRB1 gene (P = 3.23 × 10−26, OR = 1.63; Figure 1A,C) had the strongest association with asparaginase hypersensitivity.
PMC4492197	R03002	The association was also present across all protocols (supplemental Figure 2B) and with both asparaginase preparations (supplemental Figure 2C).
PMC4492197	R05001	The effect size was most pronounced in patients of European ancestry (P = 5.9 × 10−5, OR = 1.68; supplemental Figure 3A), but elevated in other ancestries, for all treatment protocols, and for both asparaginase preparations (supplemental Figure 3A-C).
PMC4492197	R06001	Our previous candidate gene analysis of HLA alleles associated with asparaginase allergies in patients of European ancestry identified an association with 10 amino acids in HLA-DRB1, and position 54 (amino acid position 25 when excluding the leader signal sequence) was among those implicated.7 From a total of 1540 HLA-DRB1 alleles with amino acid sequences included in the International ImMunoGene Tics/HLA database,19 only HLA-DRB1*01:13, HLA-DRB1*03:54, HLA-DRB1*13:92, HLA-DRB1*14:26, HLA-DRB1*15:24, and HLA-DRB1*07 encode for a Gln in position 54.
PMC4492197	R06003	Consistent with our previous analysis, the HLA-DRB1 rs17885382 variant was in linkage disequilibrium with the HLA-DRB1*07:01 allele (R2 = 0.94); therefore, it is likely that the haplotype is driving the association between rs17885382 and asparaginase hypersensitivity.
PMC4492197	R07000	In a multivariate analysis, including both rs6021191 (NFATC2) and rs17885382 (HLA-DRB1) genotype, both variants remained associated with asparaginase hypersensitivity (Prs6021191 = 1.8 × 10−8, Prs17885382 = 3.2 × 10−6), and modest increases in effect size were seen after adjusting for the genotypes (ORrs6021191 = 3.35, ORrs17885382 = 1.66).
PMC4492197	R07001	The frequency of asparaginase hypersensitivity in patients with neither of these variants was 14.8% (321 of 2173).
PMC4492197	R07005	Similar results were found taking the preparation of asparaginase into consideration.
PMC4492197	R07006	Patients receiving native E coli asparaginase carrying both risk alleles had an incidence of allergy of 50% compared with 32% among noncarriers of risk alleles, whereas patients receiving PEGylated E coli asparaginase had an incidence of allergy of 47% compared with 10% among noncarriers.
PMC4492197	R08000	Among the top 20 pathways with P values <3 × 10−3 invoked by the 334 genes having top ranked SNPs associated with asparaginase hypersensitivity, 13 pathways involved T-cell apoptosis, T-cell signaling, T-cell activation, or T-cell disorders (Figure 4A).
PMC4492197	R08002	Therefore, the pathway analysis suggests that genetic variants within genes involved in T-cell function may play a role in the development of asparaginase hypersensitivity.

PMC4501476	I10000	The fourth strongest evidence for an association was for rs6010620 (OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.21–1.35; P = 2.52 × 10−12), localizing to intron 12 (61,780,283 bp) of the RAD3-like helicase gene RTEL1 (ref 28) and mapping within a 65-kb region of LD at 20q13.33 (Fig. 2 and Table 1).

PMC4525478	I08000	We assessed known missense variants in CLPTM1L and telomerase reverse transcriptase, the potentially functional telomerase reverse transcriptase promoter variant (−1327T/C), as well as the variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) in introns 2, 6 and 12 of TERT and found that none of these variants associated significantly with any of the 5 cancer sites or could account for the association observed with rs401681 or rs2736098 (Supplementary Note and Supplementary Tables 5 and 6).
PMC4525478	I08001	Furthermore, no association was observed between rs401681(C) or rs2736098(A) and the RNA expression of telomerase reverse transcriptase or CLPTM1L in whole blood (N=991) or adipose tissue (N=662) (Supplementary Note and Supplementary Table 7).
PMC4525478	I09000	We postulated that the cancer-associated sequence variants in the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene might be associated with shorter telomeres.
PMC4525478	I12000	In conclusion, we have discovered sequence variants in the region of the telomerase reverse transcriptase and CLPTM1L genes that associate with risk of many types of cancer.
PMC4525478	I12001	The biology of the telomerase reverse transcriptase gene makes it a compelling candidate for a gene that predisposes to many cancers.

PMC4526392	A00000	O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair enzyme that protects cells from carcinogenic effects of alkylating agents; however, methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase is silenced by promoter hypermethylation during carcinogenesis.
PMC4526392	A00001	A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in an enhancer in the methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter was previously identified to be highly significantly associated with risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation in lung cancer and sputum from smokers.
PMC4526392	A00002	To further genetic investigations, a genome-wide association and replication study was conducted in two smoker cohorts to identify novel loci for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation in sputum that were independent of the methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase enhancer polymorphism.
PMC4526392	A00003	Two novel trans-acting loci (15q15.2 and 17q24.3) that were identified acted together with the enhancer SNP to empower risk prediction for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation.
PMC4526392	A00004	We found that the predisposition to methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation arising from the 15q15.2 locus involved regulation of the ubiquitin protein ligase E3 component UBR1.
PMC4526392	A00005	UBR1 attenuation reduced turnover of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase protein and increased repair of O6-methylguanine in nitrosomethylurea-treated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC), while also reducing methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter activity and abolishing MGMT induction.
PMC4526392	A00006	Overall, our results substantiate reduced gene transcription as a major mechanism for predisposition to methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation in the lungs of smokers, and support the importance of UBR1 in regulating methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase homeostasis and DNA repair of alkylated DNA adducts in cells.
PMC4526392	D00000	Our GWAS study identified cis- and trans- acting SNPs that affect silencing of a DNA repair gene (methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) by promoter hypermethylation acquired during lung carcinogenesis.
PMC4526392	D00001	Two novel trans- acting loci at chromosome 15q15.2 and 17q24.3 were identified as being associated with risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation detected in sputum and their effects were independent of the enhancer SNP rs16906252.
PMC4526392	D00002	These three SNPs together improved the ROC AUC by 20% in a logistic regression that explored determinants for risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation in current and former smokers.
PMC4526392	D00003	Thus, SNPs affecting the predisposition of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase silencing by promoter hypermethylation, together with SNPs affecting methylation of other important cancer-relevant genes acquired during carcinogenesis may lead to the establishment of a polygenic marker that could improve current risk prediction models for these cancers (18).
PMC4526392	D01000	methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status is a validated prognostic biomarker for the response of glioblastoma patients to the alkylating agent temozolomide (14).
PMC4526392	D01001	Our previous study and others also suggested that methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status may affect the response of lung tumors to temozolomide treatment (27,44).
PMC4526392	D01002	The assessment of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter activity using HEBC4 identified a 50% reduction in luciferase reporter activity for the combination of UBR1 KD and HAP4 (rs16906252 carrier) compared to wild type UBR1 and HAP1 (non rs16906252 carrier).
PMC4526392	D01003	This functional assessment strongly supports the epidemiological findings that subjects carrying variant alleles for cis- (rs16906252) and trans-(rs16957091) acting SNPs that regulate methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase transcription had the highest risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation (OR=17.9, 95%CI=10.7–30.1, p=5.8×10−28, Supplementary Table 5).
PMC4526392	D01004	Furthermore, these two SNPs should also augment methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation status for the better stratification of patients for alkylating therapy due to their association with reduced methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase transcription in MGMT unmethylated cells.
PMC4526392	D02002	Ontology classification of genes (n=115) in the region of the proximal CpG sites mediating the trans-acting associations identified GTPase activity related genes, genes regulating transcription, and genetic imprinting as the top three categories involved in DNA methylation regulation.
PMC4526392	D02003	A unique mechanism underlying the predisposition of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation in lungs of smokers involving the regulation of UBR1 expression by rs16957091 within the chromosome 15q15.2 locus was elucidated (Figure 5).
PMC4526392	D02004	Because reduced gene transcription is a major mechanism predisposing methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase for promoter hypermethylation in multiple tissue types (13,27), three HBEC lines with stable UBR1 KD were established to assess whether reduced UBR1 expression could affect the methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase transcription.
PMC4526392	D02005	The functional validity of UBR1 KD was confirmed by showing compromised degradation of suicide methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase or unmodified methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase and increased DNA repair towards MNU induced O6MG in UBR1 KD lines compared to control HBECs.
PMC4526392	D02006	These effects by UBR1 are consistent with its role of binding to the internal degrons of suicide methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase protein and even unmodified methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase for subsequent degradation via the 26S proteasome in eukaryotes (1,40,41).
PMC4526392	D02007	In addition, greater DNA repair towards O6MG in UBR1 KD lines may be due to the accumulation of unmodified methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase resulting from UBR1 KD (41).
PMC4526392	D02008	More importantly, stable UBR1 KD reduced methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter activity and abolished the induction of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase expression in HBEC models treated with non-cytotoxic MNU.
PMC4526392	D02009	These findings suggest that compromised methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase degradation may not be able to provide an efficient positive feedback to the methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase transcriptional machinery under normal physiological conditions or in response to alkylating agent exposure.
PMC4526392	D02010	Thus, our findings not only substantiate the reduced gene transcription as a major determinant for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation in the lungs of smokers, but also support the importance of UBR1 mediated N-end rule pathway in regulating methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase homeostasis and DNA repair towards alkylated DNA adducts.
PMC4526392	D04000	Our studies provide a proof-of-concept for a unique mechanism underlying the predisposition of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation in lungs of smokers that involves the regulation of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase homeostasis by UBR1/RAD6 mediated N-end rule pathway (Figure 5).

PMC4526392	I00000	O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase) is a DNA repair enzyme that protects cells from carcinogenic effects of alkylating agents by removing adducts from the O6 position of guanine (1).
PMC4526392	I00001	This repair mechanism is conserved in all organisms and involves transfer of methyl and other alkyl groups from the O6 position of guanine in DNA to a cysteine residue within enzymatic active site of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase protein.
PMC4526392	I00002	The irreversible binding of the alkyl group to the methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase protein functionally inactivates the enzyme and leads to a structural alteration resulting in the recognition by ubiquitin ligases and degradation by the proteasome (1,2).
PMC4526392	I00003	The recovery of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity after its inactivation with alkylating agents is slow and results entirely from de novo protein synthesis (3–5).
PMC4526392	I01000	The predominant mechanism for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase gene inactivation in carcinogenesis is hypermethylation of a CpG island within its promoter–enhancer region that leads to transcriptional silencing in lymphoma and several solid tumors including brain, colon, lung, and head and neck cancers (6).
PMC4526392	I01002	Although alkylating adducts such as O6MG can be derived from endogenous methylation by S- adenosylmethionine, knockouts of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase failed to show enhanced tumor formation unless treated with exogenous alkylating carcinogens (9).
PMC4526392	I01003	methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation is a common event in lung adenocarcinomas and associated with tumor progression (10).
PMC4526392	I01004	Concomitant methylation of a panel of cancer-relevant genes including methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase detected in lung epithelial cells present in sputum predicts risk for subsequent lung cancer incidence in moderate and heavy smokers (11,12).
PMC4526392	I01005	In addition, methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation is also a prognostic biomarker for response of glioblastoma patients to the alkylating agent temozolomide (13,14).
PMC4526392	I03001	This is illustrated by our studies and others for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation.
PMC4526392	I03002	An enhancer SNP rs16906252 located at the first exon-intron boundary of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase was highly significantly associated with risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation in colorectal cancer, pleural mesothelioma, lung adenocarcinoma, glioblastoma, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (13,27,29–32).
PMC4526392	I03003	Significant association was also seen for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation in sputum from smokers (27).
PMC4526392	I03005	Although rs16906252 is a major determinant for acquisition of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation in lung carcinogenesis, 20% of current and former smokers carrying wild homozygote (G/G) of rs16906252 are methylated for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase in their sputum (27), suggesting that other genetic or environmental factors may contribute to MGMT methylation.
PMC4526392	I03006	To address this issue, a GWAS discovery and replication study was conducted in two smoker cohorts from New Mexico to identify novel loci whose association with risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation detected in sputum was independent of the enhancer SNP.
PMC4526392	M01004	Methylation status for CpGs around the transcriptional start site of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase was assessed using two stage methylation specific PCR (33).
PMC4526392	M03000	Four SNPs (rs72887860, rs62287262, rs16957091, and rs997781) associated with risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation in LSC (p<10−5 in models with adjustment for rs16906252) and with MAF >0.1 were selected for replication using the VSC (n=430, Supplementary Table 2).
PMC4526392	M07000	A 1,528-bp fragment containing the entire promoter and CpG island of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase with different haplotype alleles was previously cloned into the pGL2-basic Luciferase Reporter Vector (Promega, Madison, WI) upstream of the luciferase coding sequence (27).
PMC4526392	M07001	Luciferase reporter constructs that contain HAP1 (wild haplotype allele) or HAP4 (haplotype allele carrying A allele of rs16906252) were transiently transfected in control HBEC4 and HBEC4 with UBR1 KD using Lipofectamine 3000.
PMC4526392	M07003	Cells were harvested 48 h post transfection and reporter activity was measured using the Dual Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Madison, WI).
PMC4526392	M09000	Western blot was conducted to quantify protein levels of UBR1 and methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase using antibodies from Abcam (anti-UBR1 antibody, ab42420) and Invitrogen (mouse anti-MGMT, 35–7000).
PMC4526392	M09001	Protein extract (90 μg) was digested with 100 ng endoproteinase GluC in a 25 μl reaction mixture before being resolved in PAGE gels (36).
PMC4526392	M09002	Naïve and suicide methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase protein levels were quantified by densitometry (Image Lab, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) of the individual bands.
PMC4526392	M12001	The genotype of rs16906252 was further included for covariate adjustment in models that would identify novel SNPs whose association with risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation was independent of rs16906252.
PMC4526392	M13000	In the VSC replication, logistic regression was applied to assess the association between each individual SNP and risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation in 430 subjects with adjustment for age, ethnicity (Hispanic versus non-Hispanic White), and rs16906252.
PMC4526392	M13002	However, the inclusion of both ethnicities should not affect our results because the prevalence of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation and the distribution of the four SNPs are not different between the two major ethnicities in the VSC.
PMC4526392	M14000	Generalized linear models (GLM) were used to assess the associations between SNPs under the additive inheritance model and gene expression (delta Ct relative to β-actin) in primary human BECs and normal lung tissues; between UBR1 KD status, promoter haplotype, and methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter activity in HBEC4; between UBR1 KD status and induction of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase expression upon MNU treatment; and between rs16857091 and log10 transformed percentage of cells with chromosomal damage.
PMC4526392	M14002	The paired t-test was used to compare the difference of the ratio of naïve versus suicide methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase and O6MG between UBR1 KD and control cell lines.
PMC4526392	R00001	GWAS discovery was conducted in 1163 LSC members with methylation of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase detected in 296 subjects (25.5%).
PMC4526392	R00002	Thirty-six common SNPs (MAF>0.1) were associated with risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation with p<10−5 (Supplementary Table 2).
PMC4526392	R00003	Enhancer SNP rs16906252 (not included on the HumanOmni2.5–4v1-H BeadChip) previously shown to be highly significantly associated with risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation was genotyped in the 1163 LSC members and the association clearly reached genome wide significance (p=4.3×10−31).
PMC4526392	R00005	SNPs located around the methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter became non-significant (ps>0.94, Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Figure 2), suggesting the associations seen for these SNPs reflected some degree of linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rs16906252.
PMC4526392	R01000	Four SNPs (rs72887860, rs62287262, rs16957091, and rs997781) associated with risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation in LSC with p<10−5 and MAF >0.1 were selected for replication in 430 members from the Veteran Smokers cohort (VSC) with methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation detected in 107 subjects (24.9%).
PMC4526392	R02003	Association analyses based on imputation results on chromosome 15 identified five SNPs associated with risk for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase methylation with p-values slightly lower than that seen for rs16957091, although all five SNPs are in almost perfect LD with rs16957091 (R2s≥0.95) (Figure 2).
PMC4526392	R05000	UBR1 contains binding sites recognizing internal degrons of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase protein and UBR1/RAD6-dependent N-end rule pathway is a major mechanism targeting suicide methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase protein by alkylating agents and also unmodified MGMT for subsequent degradation via the 26S proteasome in eukaryotes (40,41).
PMC4526392	R05001	Recovery of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity after its inactivation results entirely from de novo protein synthesis (4).
PMC4526392	R05002	Our previous studies demonstrated reduced gene transcription associated with the enhancer SNP rs16906252 as a major mechanism predisposing methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase for promoter hypermethylation in the lungs of smokers (27).
PMC4526392	R05003	Thus, the lower expression of UBR1 associated with rs16957091 variant allele could result in slower turnover of the methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase protein under normal physiological conditions and/or following repair in response to challenge by the alkylating agents, that in turn may lead to reduced methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase transcription.
PMC4526392	R06001	A protease V8 digestion method (36) was used to distinguish naïve and suicide methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase in HBEC1 treated with different MNU concentrations (0, 0.5, 1, 2.5 mM) for 30 min.
PMC4526392	R06002	The ratio of naïve versus suicide methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase decreased with increasing concentrations of MNU treatment with almost no active methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase left at the highest MNU concentration (not shown).
PMC4526392	R06003	Interestingly, without MNU treatment, protease V8 cutting is still detected supporting formation of endogenous alkylating DNA adducts as a part of normal cellular metabolism in these cells (1,42), although the assay specificity for detecting suicide methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase may not be perfect due to its potential binding to other proteins.
PMC4526392	R06004	The ratio of naïve versus suicide methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase was higher in control HBECs compared to UBR1 KD lines (0.95 vs 0.71, paired ttest p=0.037, Figure 1b) with the largest difference seen in HBEC26 (0.36, Figure 1c), suggesting accumulation of suicide methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase in UBR1 KD lines.
PMC4526392	R06005	UBR1 knockout cells are resistant to alkylating agent (MNNG) induced genotoxicity probably because UBR1 targets both alkylated and unmodified methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (41).
PMC4526392	R06010	The modest but statistically significant effect of UBR1 KD on methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase degradation and repair of O6-methylguanine may reflect the complexity of constitutive and exogenous alkylating agent-accelerated degradation of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase.
PMC4526392	R06011	In addition to the UBR1/RAD6-dependent N-end rule pathway, UFD4/UBC4-dependent ubiquitin fusion degradation pathway functions as an enhancer of the processivity of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase polyubiquitylation by N-end rule pathway through physical interaction between the HECT-type UFD4 E3 and the RING-type UBR1 E3 (40,41).
PMC4526392	R08000	Reduced gene transcription is a major mechanism predisposing methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase for promoter hypermethylation in multiple tissue types (13,27), therefore a luciferase reporter assay was used to assess whether UBR1 KD would result in reduced methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter activity.
PMC4526392	R08006	These findings suggest that impaired methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase turnover due to UBR1 KD may lead to reduced methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase transcription, an important factor in the predisposition for promoter hypermethylation of MGMT.
PMC4526392	R09000	The recovery of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase activity after its inactivation by alkylating agent results entirely from de novo protein synthesis and this rate differs between pulmonary cell types in the rat (4,43).
PMC4526392	R09001	Furthermore, a large induction of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase measured in steady state RNA has been observed in rat liver cell lines >24 hr post alkylating agent treatment and was due to activation of the methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase promoter (3,5).
PMC4526392	R09002	Strong induction of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase expression in steady state RNA was also observed in control HBEC4 and HBEC26 at 24 and 48 hr post MNU treatment (1mM), but not in control HBEC1 (Figure 4b).
PMC4526392	R09004	GLM was conducted to assess the effect of UBR1 status (KD vs. WT) and time point (24 hr vs 48 hr) on induction of methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase expression in HBEC4 and HBEC26.
PMC4526392	R09005	methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase induction at 24 and 48 hr post MNU treatment was not statistically different in either cell lines (ps>0.11).
PMC4526392	R09006	However, statistically significant differences were identified for methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase induction between control and UBR1 KD in HBEC4 (least square means and standard error, 1.68 ± 0.068 vs. 1.17 ± 0.068, p=0.0057) and HBEC26 (least square means and standard error, 1.43 ± 0.067 vs. 1.13 ± 0.067, p=0.032) in the GLM with adjustment for assay batch and time point (24 vs. 48 hr).

PMC4600016	D01002	These findings suggest the involvement of the glutamate pathway in the pathogenesis of osteonecrosis not only in childhood ALL, but in a heterogeneous cohort of children and adults who were treated with prolonged corticosteroids for other medical conditions.30,31 Interestingly, we previously reported that polymorphisms within a third glutamate receptor gene, GRIA1, were the top genomic variants associated with asparaginase allergy in a GWAS of children with ALL in the SJ cohort,32 a finding recently independently replicated.33
PMC4600016	D01003	We have also reported that asparaginase allergy was associated with lower systemic exposure to asparaginase,34 which in turn was associated with a lower risk of osteonecrosis in the SJ cohort.35 This prompted us to evaluate asparaginase allergy in the COG AALL0232 discovery cohort (n = 1845 with follow-up >800 days), and consistent with the SJ cohort, grades 2-4 asparaginase allergy was associated with the risk of osteonecrosis: 206 out of 1647 (12.5%) for those without asparaginase allergies had osteonecrosis compared with 12 out of 198 (6.7%) for those with asparaginase allergies (P = .0096).
PMC4600016	D02000	Concomitant asparaginase treatment is associated with higher plasma exposure to dexamethasone.7,34 Although it is possible that the glutamate receptor pathway association was via secondary effects on asparaginase, which affects risk of osteonecrosis in ALL patients,35 this does not explain the association of the glutamate pathway within the BioVU cohort, whose patients did not receive asparaginase, and thus also implicates a mechanism with a direct effect of glutamate receptors.

PMC4641004	D02003	It is known that microtubules are involved in various signaling pathways, such as sonic hedgehog/Gli, Wnt/β-catenin, G-protein, and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways which are related to skeletal development and homeostasis.25,26 Interestingly, recent reports noted that inhibition of microtubule assembly increases osteoblast differentiation in vitro, and murine bone mass in vivo.27,28 Formation of new microtubule polymers from heterodimers of α and β tubulin is termed ‘nucleation’ and requires another member of the tubulin family, γ tubulin.29 γ tubulin forms γ tubulin ring complexes with additional proteins and these γ tubulin complexes may also be involved in regulating microtubule dynamics.30 Tubulin folding cofactor D coded by TBCD is one of the five tubulin-specific cochaperones A-E that mediate the nucleation of tubulin.31 Tubulin folding cofactor D plays a critical role in recruiting γ tubulin ring complexes and initiating microtubule growth and excess of tubulin folding cofactor D inhibits microtubule assembly.12 Taken together, it is possible that a disruption in the γ tubulin pathway in the osteoblast cells may result in BMD changes and these changes may be modified via genetic factors.

PMC4653118	A00005	Our results reveal robust genome-wide associations (p value <5 × 10−8) with ALA, all four n-6 PUFAs, and delta-6 desaturase activity at the FADS1/FADS2 locus.
PMC4653118	D01000	We confirmed the importance of common variants in/near the central desaturase genes, FADS1 and FADS2 on chromosome 11, which showed robust associations with n-3 PUFA (ALA) and n-6 PUFAs (LA, GLA, DGLA and AA) in the Singaporean Chinese.
PMC4653118	D02000	Increased delta-6 desaturase activity is associated with an increased plasma GLA:LA ratio.
PMC4653118	D02003	The same allele also showed robust associations with higher AA and lower DGLA concentrations in our dataset, as previously reported (Guan et al. 2014), suggesting a higher delta-5 desaturase activity.
PMC4653118	D02004	However, we do not find evidence that the FADS1/2 locus is associated with delta-5 desaturase activity.
PMC4653118	D02005	This lack of association between delta-5 desaturase activity, and the FADS1/2 locus is also consistent with a previous study that analyzed subjects of European ancestry (Bokor et al. 2010).
PMC4653118	D02006	Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that a rare variant (rs968567) in weak LD with the common variants evaluated in our study (r2 = 0.4 between rs968567 and rs174547 in HapMap CEU population; rs968567 not available for HapMap East-Asian reference population) at the FADS2 promoter site may still be associated with delta-5 desaturase (Bokor et al. 2010).

PMC4962704	D01002	Among 4,379 patients, the two who carried this variant developed severe pancreatitis within weeks of their first dose of asparaginase (Fig 3B), suggesting asparaginase will not be tolerated long enough to be effective in patients who inherit this rare variant.
PMC4962704	D01006	These data suggest that CPA2 variant carriers are at high risk of pancreatitis if treated with asparaginase.
PMC4962704	D01007	ALL treatment regimens vary substantially in the amount of asparaginase they include; an ALL treatment regimen that does not depend heavily on asparaginase may be preferable for these rare individuals.
PMC4962704	D02001	Pancreatic carboxypeptidases are secreted from acinar cells as proenzymes, then cleaved and activated by trypsin in the duodenum.
PMC4962704	D06001	Although steroids and thiopurines can cause pancreatitis, asparaginase is most likely the cause in the majority of our patients, because of its early onset (coinciding with asparaginase; Data Supplement Figure 1) and its relationship to asparaginase dose and duration2-4,6,7,34,43 (Figs 2B and 2C).
PMC4962704	D07000	In summary, we showed older age, higher exposure to asparaginase, and higher Native American ancestry were independent risk factors for pancreatitis during ALL treatment.
PMC4962704	D07003	For the small number of patients carrying the highly penetrant CPA2 variants, a precision medicine approach using ALL regimens containing less asparaginase should be considered.

PMC4962704	I00000	Asparaginase is a major cause of pancreatitis that occurs in 2% to 18% of patients treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL),1-9 although steroids and thiopurines can also cause this complication.10-12 Severe pancreatitis is a contraindication to further asparaginase therapy and has been associated with compromised treatment outcome.3,7,13 Better understanding the risk factors for pancreatitis could help improve ALL therapy by identifying mechanisms of pancreatitis, which might lead to new interventions to prevent or reverse it, or by identifying patients at such high risk that consideration of non–asparaginase-containing regimens would be warranted.
PMC4962704	I01000	The pathogenesis of asparaginase-induced pancreatitis has not been elucidated.
PMC4962704	I01001	Clinical risk factors include intensive asparaginase and older age1-4,7,14,15; however, most studies lack sufficient power to robustly assess risk factors.4-8
PMC4962704	I02000	Studies on pancreatitis of other etiologies, such as alcoholic pancreatitis, have identified a few genetic risk factors (eg, PRSS1, PRSS2, SPINK1, CFTR, CTRC, CASR, CLDN2, CPA1, and HLA-DRB1*07:01), most of which relate to premature trypsin activation or sustained trypsin activity in the pancreas.16-23 However, there has not been an agnostic genome-wide association study (GWAS) of asparaginase-induced acute pancreatitis.24
PMC4962704	I02001	Here we report the largest study to date to determine the clinical and genetic risk factors for acute pancreatitis in 5,398 patients treated for newly diagnosed ALL with contemporary regimens containing asparaginase.
PMC4962704	M01002	From approximately 5,500 patients enrolled in AALL0331, there were 103 cases of pancreatitis; of these, we included all 71 cases who had available germline DNA and successful genotyping and matched two controls to each case by age (± 2 years) and protocol-planned asparaginase doses.
PMC4962704	M02001	The criteria were similar across all studies, including symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting), increased serum amylase or lipase, and radiographic or surgical findings.
PMC4962704	M02004	To identify covariates to include in the GWAS, we used the Fine-Gray regression model for competing risks29 to evaluate the association between pancreatitis and variables including age (in years) and genetic ancestry (as percentages of European, African, Asian, and Native American ancestries)30 as continuous variables; sex, ALL immunophenotype, and treatment regimen (protocol-planned cumulative asparaginase dose ≤ 120,000 U/m2v ≥ 240,000 U/m2) were also included as categorical variables.
PMC4962704	M02006	For purposes of normalizing asparaginase doses across protocols, pegylated Escherichia coli–asparaginase (PEG-asparaginase) at 2,500 U/m2 every other week was considered equivalent to native Escherichia coli–asparaginase at 25,000 U/m2 once per week for 2 weeks.
PMC4962704	R00003	The great majority of the events were clustered with asparaginase administration (Data Supplement Figure 1).
PMC4962704	R01000	Considering the data herein and also prior publications of other front-line ALL protocols,2-4,6,7,33,34 the crude rate of pancreatitis was related to cumulative asparaginase dose (R2, 0.75; P < .001) and duration of asparaginase treatment (R2, 0.83; P < .001; Figs 2B and ​and2C).2C).
PMC4962704	R01001	Because asparaginase dose and duration were correlated (R2, 0.64; P = .0011; Data Supplement Figure 2), it was not possible to determine which was more important for pancreatitis risk.
PMC4962704	R02001	High-dose asparaginase regimens (≥ 240,000 U/m2) were associated with more pancreatitis (HR, 3.2; P < .001).
PMC4962704	R02002	Patients who received PEG-asparaginase alone did not have significantly more pancreatitis than those who received the native formulation (P = .11), but formulation was not the only variable that differed among protocols.
PMC4962704	R02004	To minimize the effect of dose as a confounder for evaluating formulation, we looked at P9904/P9905, the only study that included patients treated with one or the other formulation (Data Supplement Table 3), and the crude percentage with pancreatitis did not differ between those who received native asparaginase alone (0.8%, six of 723), PEG-asparaginase alone (0.9%, three of 347), or both (0.6%, three of 535).
PMC4962704	R03004	Two of 3,469 patients carried this variant (one in the cohort and one in the case-control group), and both developed early pancreatitis (Fig 3B); one of them had recurrent episodes after each of two asparaginase re-exposures.

PMC5309133	A00002	Additional genetic variants (besides the 3 SNPs rs1800462, rs1800460 and rs1142345 defining thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype) did not significantly improve classification accuracy for thiopurine S- methyltransferase phenotype.
PMC5309133	A00003	Clinical mercaptopurine tolerability in 839 patients was related to thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype (P = 2.4 × 10−11).
PMC5309133	A00004	Using 177 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), there were 251 SNPs ranked higher than the top thiopurine S- methyltransferase SNP (rs1142345 P = 6.8 × 10−5), showing the limitation of LCLs for pharmacogenomic discovery.
PMC5309133	A00005	In a GWAS, thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in patients behaves as a monogenic trait, further bolstering the utility of thiopurine S- methyltransferase genetic testing in the clinic.
PMC5309133	D00001	thiopurine S- methyltransferase genotype is an indicator for the starting dose of thiopurines,(22) and has been advocated to prevent toxicities in those with thiopurine S- methyltransferase defects without compromising treatment outcome.(4, 23)
PMC5309133	D00002	However, some studies suggested that thiopurine S- methyltransferase genotype might not be a perfect predictor for the phenotype with a concordance of 53–100% in heterozygotes.(24)
PMC5309133	D00003	Also, not all thiopurine S- methyltransferase wild-type patients tolerated full dose of mercaptopurine; the average dose intensity for wild-types ranged between 80–85%.(21, 25)
PMC5309133	D01000	Herein, we confirmed that thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity is a monogenic pharmacogenomic trait in two independent ALL cohorts with diverse racial backgrounds using a genome-wide agnosticagnostic approach.
PMC5309133	D01001	The GWAS for thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity (Figure 3) revealed a strong association in the thiopurine S- methyltransferase region: all 94 genome-wide significant SNPs were in or adjacent to TPMT (Table S2).
PMC5309133	D01002	This is most likely because they are in LD with no-function variants in thiopurine S- methyltransferase (Figure S1).
PMC5309133	D02000	Heterozygosity at the three commonly tested no-function variants (*2, *3A and *3C) was associated with lower thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity and lower dose intensity than those with *1/*1 genotype (Figures 2 and ​and4).4).
PMC5309133	D02001	Patients with *1/*8 (very common in African Americans) or *1/*24 genotypes had intermediate thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity but tolerated normal dose intensity comparing to those with *1/*1, partially supporting the current categorization of these patients as thiopurine S- methyltransferase wild-types.
PMC5309133	D02003	(677G>A at rs139392616) was described by Udaka et al(26) by sequencing the thiopurine S- methyltransferase gene in 288 individuals; however its phenotype is not clear.
PMC5309133	D02004	Herein, we observed one Hispanic patient (MAF = 0.2% in Hispanics) who carried TPMT*X, and this patient had intermediate thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity of 12.8 U/mL. Of 11,566 Latino subjects in the ExAC dataset, three individuals were heterozygous for this variant, yielding an MAF of 0.03%.
PMC5309133	D03000	thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype based on only 3 SNPs had high predictive capacity for thiopurine S- methyltransferase phenotype (Figure S5).
PMC5309133	D03001	Although TPMT*8, TPMT*24 and three intronic variants detectable by arrays were associated with intermediate or low thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in the entire cohort (Figure 2 and Table S1), we were unable to significantly improve the test performance by considering these additional variants (Figure S6).
PMC5309133	D03002	As expected, sequencing does detect additional variants not interrogated by arrays: in the relatively small subset of 296 SJ patients, these additional variants explained 3.8% variability in thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity, compared to the 34% of variability accounted for by clinical genotyping (based on 3 SNPs).
PMC5309133	D03003	To extrapolate the possible contribution of rare variants to thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity based on sequencing data from a much larger sample size (the ~ 60,000 individuals in ExAC), we estimated that additional rare thiopurine S- methyltransferase variants only explain an additional 1.2% of variation in TPMT activity beyond that explained by the 3 clinically genotyped variants.
PMC5309133	D03004	Unlike some other drug metabolism/disposition genes, no-function thiopurine S- methyltransferase variants are relatively common and rare no-function alleles are less common,(27, 28) confirmed by lower population fixation index (FST) values.(29)
PMC5309133	D03005	Thus, genotyping of the three no-function SNPs (rs1800462, rs1800460 and rs1142345) is still the most reliable method to determine thiopurine S- methyltransferase phenotype, and rare variants maymay be less of a problem for thiopurine S- methyltransferase than for other actionable pharmacogenes.
PMC5309133	D04000	We found no non-TPMT genes with a significant effect on thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in this GWAS.
PMC5309133	D04001	Given an alpha level of 1×10−7, we had 80% power to detect any SNPs with MAF of at least 5% with an effect size of 40% of those of thiopurine S- methyltransferase variants.
PMC5309133	D04002	There could be trans-SNPs with weaker effect sizes or lower MAF that could influence thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity, but a larger sample size would be needed to discover those SNPs.
PMC5309133	D05000	After adjusting for thiopurine S- methyltransferase genotype, thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity was associated with variants in ADCY2 among SJ patients and with ARHGEF11 among COG patients (Figure S4).
PMC5309133	D05003	In any case, the effect of additional genetic factors on thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity was not comparable to the effect of thiopurine S- methyltransferase genotype.
PMC5309133	D06000	Variants in FTO(30, 31) were modestly associated with thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity (Table S7).
PMC5309133	D06001	Interestingly, over-expression of FTO upregulated the expression of thiopurine S- methyltransferase in mice.(32)
PMC5309133	D06002	However, in this study the FTO variants only accounted for a minor change in thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity: among the 896 patients wild-type for thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype, those with two vs one vs zero C alleles at rs1345390 had a median activity of 19.5, 19.0, and 18.2 U/mL vs (P = 7.3 × 10−6 after adjusting for clinical features).
PMC5309133	D07001	Here we showed that thiopurine S- methyltransferase variant rs1142345 was associated with thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in 177 HapMap LCLs but only ranked 252 among all HapMap SNPs (Table S8), while the permutation tests in patients showed that rs1142345 was always top-ranked (Figure S3).
PMC5309133	D07002	It should be noted that rs1142345 is in complete LD with the thiopurine S- methyltransferase haplotype (named HAP1) that we previously reported as the highest ranked thiopurine S- methyltransferase SNP associated with TPMT activity in HapMap CEU LCLs.(8)The difference between the results from LCLs and from patients may be attributed to different conditions in cultured cell lines and in vivo, particularly because LCLs are transformed by EBV infection, which may impact genetic regulation.(33)
PMC5309133	D07006	Moreover, thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity may differ in lymphocytes vs erythrocytes.(37)
PMC5309133	D07007	We have reported previously that the expression of PACSIN2 and its cis-SNP (rs2413739) were related to thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in 30 HapMap CEU trios.(9)
PMC5309133	D07008	In the current study, rs2413739 was not associated with thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in patients (P = 0.14 and 0.54 in SJ and COG, respectively, after adjusting for thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype).We compared our results with another study that used a pathway approach;(38) among the top ranked SNPs from that study, only the 2 SNPs in TPMT were replicated in our study of HapMap LCLs and in SJ and COG patients (Table S9).
PMC5309133	D08000	Race-specific differences in thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity and mercaptopurine metabolism have been observed ,(12–17) and African ancestry has been related to lower thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity(12–14) and lower levels of methylated metabolites.(15)
PMC5309133	D08001	Some studies reported a higher prevalence of thiopurine S- methyltransferase variants in blacks(21) but other did not.(18, 39)
PMC5309133	D08002	In the current study, black patients had a lower thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity compared to non-blacks (P = 7.7 × 10−8), and tended to have a higher frequency of no-function variants than whites (P = 0.19; Figure 1B).The addition of thiopurine S- methyltransferase genotype to the multivariate model did not affect the association of African ancestry with low activity (Table 1), suggesting that other genetic factors may be involved; however, in a meta-analysis of African-ancestry patients only (SJ n = 44 and COG n = 87), all genome-wide significant SNPs (n = 21) locate within TPMT, similar to the observation in all patients.
PMC5309133	D08003	After adjusting for thiopurine S- methyltransferase genotype, we were unable to find additional strong genetic associations (P < 10−6) with thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity (data not shown).
PMC5309133	D08004	Given that black patients tend to have a high risk of relapse(40–42) and that thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity might be associated with relapse risk,(23, 43, 44) genetic and non-genetic factors should be considered in dose individualization in those patients.
PMC5309133	D09000	There have been conflicting reports on the relationship between age and thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity.
PMC5309133	D09002	Here we observed that older age was associated with lower thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity after adjusting for thiopurine S- methyltransferase genotype in both cohorts (Table 1).
PMC5309133	D10000	In summary, we used a genome-wide agnosticagnostic approach to confirm that thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity was a monogenic trait, and that current strategies for clinical thiopurine S- methyltransferase genetic testing based on only three genomic variants adequately classify patients for their TPMT phenotype in a multiethnic cohort, thereby bolstering the use of TPMT genetic testing to assess TPMT status in the clinic.

PMC5309133	I01002	Moreover, racial and ethnic differences exist: patients of African ancestry have lower thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity(12–14) and lower levels of methylated metabolites(15) than other populations, and Asian patients were relatively intolerant to thiopurines,(16) despite their low frequency of thiopurine S- methyltransferase variant alleles.(17)
PMC5309133	I01003	However, a non-TPMT genetic basis for racial variation in thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity is not known.
PMC5309133	I01004	Current strategies for clinical thiopurine S- methyltransferase genetic testing test for three variants: rs1800462 (238G>C), rs1800460 (460G>A) and rs1142345 (719A>G).
PMC5309133	I01005	Here we studied two ethnically diverse cohorts of children with ALL using agnostic GWAS approaches to evaluate the contribution of genetic variation in thiopurine S- methyltransferase and other genes to thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity and effects on thiopurine tolerance, and to determine whether current TPMT genetic testing adequately classifies patients for their TPMT phenotype.
PMC5309133	M01000	A preliminary thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype was based on PCR tests for three known no-function variants: rs1800462, rs1800460 and rs1142345 (contributing to *2, *3A and *3C alleles) .(50)
PMC5309133	M01001	Considering the impact of anemia and blood transfusion on thiopurine S- methyltransferase enzymatic activity, (50, 51) blood samples were collected after remission induction and ≥ 90 days after erythrocyte transfusions.
PMC5309133	M02001	SJ patients received 50–75 mg/m2/day, with those heterozygous for thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype receiving a starting mercaptopurine dose of 50–60 mg/m2/d .
PMC5309133	M02002	Mercaptopurine dosage was also titrated based on thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity and thiopurine metabolites.
PMC5309133	M03004	We also identified additional variants by sequencing the thiopurine S- methyltransferase gene in SJ patients (n = 296; Table S3), as described.(53)
PMC5309133	M04001	To identify covariates, we used multiple linear regression to evaluate the association between thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity and variables including age (years) and ancestry (as % European, African, Asian and Native American ancestries)(52) as continuous variables.
PMC5309133	M04002	After excluding SNPs with a call rate < 95%, over 9 million SNPs (including 578233 typed SNPs) were interrogated in the initial GWAS for thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in the SJ and COG cohorts separately.
PMC5309133	M05000	To determine non-TPMT genetic covariates for thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity, we conducted a second GWAS that included the covariates of ancestry and age as continuous variables, and thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype coded as 0 (wild-type), 1 (heterozygous) or 2 (homozygous) for the number of *2, *3A, or *3C alleles.
PMC5309133	M06001	thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity for each cell line was determined.(8, 9) Genotypes for ~4 million SNPs were obtained from release 28 of the International HapMap Project (http://www.hapmap.org).
PMC5309133	M06002	A GWAS for thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity was performed using genetic ancestry as a continuous variable.
PMC5309133	M08000	Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of thiopurine S- methyltransferase genotypes for dichotomized thiopurine S- methyltransferase phenotypes were calculated using the numbers of patients with true positive, false positive, true negative and false negative results (Figures S5 and S6) .
PMC5309133	M08001	The classification performance of thiopurine S- methyltransferase genotypes was evaluated in terms of receiver-operator-characteristic (ROC) curves (Figures S5 and S6).
PMC5309133	R00000	Among the 1026 patients who had thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype (Table 1), thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity displayed normal distributions within the 938 patients whose TPMT clinical genotype was wild-type and the 87 heterozygotes who carried a known no-function variant of *2, *3A or *3C (Figure 1A).
PMC5309133	R00001	Heterozygous patients showed lower thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity (median 10.4 U/mL erythrocytes, range 6.3–17.0 U/mL) than wild-type patients (median 19.8 U/mL, range 7.1–33.1 U/mL, P = 1.2 × 10−73).
PMC5309133	R00002	The one homozygous deficient patient (who carried *3A and *3C) had negligible activity of 0.5 U/mL. The percentage of thiopurine S- methyltransferase heterozygotes tended to be higher in blacks (13%) than in whites (9%, Chi-square P = 0.19; Figure 1B).
PMC5309133	R00003	Overall, blacks (n = 138) also had lower thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity than non-blacks (n = 825; P = 7.7 × 10−8).
PMC5309133	R00004	In a multivariate model, thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype was the strongest determinant of erythrocyte thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity after adjusting for clinical characteristics and genetic ancestry (meta-analysis P = 2.3 × 10−67; Table 2).
PMC5309133	R00005	African ancestry (meta-P = 1.4 × 10−7) and older age (meta-P = 6.6 × 10−4) were also associated with lower thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in both SJ and COG cohorts after adjusting for thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype.
PMC5309133	R01002	Similar to previous reports,(18, 19) thiopurine S- methyltransferase diplotypes varied substantially by race (Table 3).
PMC5309133	R01006	Patients heterozygous for the TPMT*24 allele (537G>T) had activity that was intermediate (n = 10; median 14.2 U/mL, range 8.0 – 23.9 U/mL) between those of thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical heterozygotes (P = 3.9 × 10−8) and *1/*1 wild-types (P = 0.002).
PMC5309133	R01009	Patients who carried a *8 allele tended to have thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity (median 14.7 U/mL, range 12.1–21.1 U/mL; Figure 2) that was lower than those with thiopurine S- methyltransferase *1/*1 (median 18.6 U/mL, range 7.1–33.1 U/mL; P = 0.15) but higher than those with heterozygote clinical genotype including *2, *3A or *3C (P = 3.9 × 10−8).
PMC5309133	R02000	The GWAS for thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity was performed in two cohorts of 306 SJ and 578 COG patients separately (Figures 3A–B), followed by a meta-analysis that combined the results from the two cohorts (Figure 3C).
PMC5309133	R02001	After adjusting for age and ancestry, we observed a strong association between thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity and polymorphisms in the thiopurine S- methyltransferase region.
PMC5309133	R02002	There were 94 typed or imputed SNPs (coding and non-coding) with a meta-analysis P value that reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8), all within 27kb of the thiopurine S- methyltransferase gene (Table S2).
PMC5309133	R02005	Using a linear model, the three clinical no-function alleles of thiopurine S- methyltransferase (*2, *3A and *3C) explained 24.9% of variability of thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity.
PMC5309133	R02007	The 92 SNPs that reached genome-wide significance (the 94 SNPs in Table S2, excluding the clinical SNPs of rs1142345 and rs1800460) accounted for another 0.9% in thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity variability beyond that explained by the clinically tested alleles of *2, *3A and *3C.
PMC5309133	R03000	To estimate the possible contribution of additional rare variants (beyond those interrogated on arrays) to thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity, we took two approaches.
PMC5309133	R03001	First, we sequenced the thiopurine S- methyltransferase locus in a subset (n = 296) of SJ patients.
PMC5309133	R03002	We detected 121 SNPs in thiopurine S- methyltransferase and its adjacent region, and found 10 SNPs (all of them intronic and with common MAF) were associated with thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity (P < 0.05) after adjusting for clinical genotype (Table S3), with the highest ranked SNP rs115104049 (upstream of TPMT) having P = 0.0003.
PMC5309133	R03003	The 10 variants explained 3.8% of variability of the thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in this subset of SJ patients, compared with 34% of variability explained by *2, *3A and *3C in the SJ subset.
PMC5309133	R03004	Secondly, we performed a simulation based on thiopurine S- methyltransferase variants that have been deposited in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) dataset (Table S4).(20)
PMC5309133	R03006	Assuming these rare damaging thiopurine S- methyltransferase variants have similar effect sizes as do thiopurine S- methyltransferase *2/*3A/*3C, we estimate that 1.2% (95% CI: 0.78%–1.65%) of variation in TPMT activity could possibly be explained by additional rare TPMT variants, indicating a likely minimal contribution of other SNPs in the locus.
PMC5309133	R04000	To identify whether there were non-TPMT genetic determinants, we conducted a second GWAS using thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype as a covariate, and after adjusting for age, ancestry and thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype, we observed a locus in the ADCY2 gene associated with TPMT activity in 306 SJ patients (Table S5 and Figure S2A).
PMC5309133	R04003	This SNP was associated with higher thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity across all race groups in SJ (Figure S3).
PMC5309133	R04005	Among the 578 COG patients, the top non-TPMT hit associated with thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity was a missense SNP rs142134087 in ARHGEF11 (P = 2.0 × 10−8; Table S6 and Figure S2B).
PMC5309133	R04006	This SNP was rare in the COG cohort (MAF = 0.2%) and absent in the SJ cohort; two individuals who were heterozygous for rs142134087 had high thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity (with a mean of 31.9 U/mL).
PMC5309133	R04007	We also identified a SNP in a purine metabolism gene, FHIT (rs75341016, P = 3.7 × 10−7) associated with decreased thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity.
PMC5309133	R04009	In the meta-analysis of non-TPMT SNPs, no SNP reached genome-wide significance (Table S7 and Figure S2C); rs1345390 in FTO was the top-ranked genotyped SNP associated with increased thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in SJ (P = 4.5 × 10−3) and COG patients (P = 7.9 × 10−5), and in the meta-analysis (P = 1.6 × 10−6).
PMC5309133	R05000	We also assessed whether thiopurine S- methyltransferase was the strongest genetic determinant of thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in HapMap LCLs.
PMC5309133	R05001	thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in the 88 YRI cell lines (median 16.7 U/mL, range 0.2–46.6 U/mL) was lower than that in the 89 CEPH cell lines (median 26.0 U/mL, range 9.1–98.0 U/mL; P = 9.9 × 10−14), consistent with the observation that African ancestry was associated with lower activity in patients (Table 2 and Figure 1B).
PMC5309133	R05003	Unlike for primary erythrocyte data in patients, the top ranked SNPs for cell lines did not include thiopurine S- methyltransferase SNPs.
PMC5309133	R05004	The highest ranked SNP within thiopurine S- methyltransferase was rs1142345 (719A>G), which only ranked 252 (P = 6.8 × 10−5) among all SNPs (Table S8).
PMC5309133	R05005	Among the 94 SNPs that were genome-wide significant in patients (Table S2), 10 were also genotyped in LCLs, and 5 were associated with thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity at the P < 0.05 level.
PMC5309133	R06000	To partially address the striking difference in the ranking of thiopurine S- methyltransferase SNPs for primary data in patients’ erythrocytes compared to the cell line data, we performed 20 random permutations in the SJ and COG cohorts separately, using the same number of patients (n = 177) and the same model used for the GWAS of the HapMap LCLs.
PMC5309133	R06001	Among 169521 coding SNPs interrogated in the permutations, thiopurine S- methyltransferase rs1142345 remained as the highest ranked with P values ranging from 3.8 × 10−7 to 6.2 × 10−13 (Figure S4).
PMC5309133	R06002	The top ranked SNPs associated with thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity in the permutation tests were similar to those from the patient GWAS in the two separate cohorts (data not shown).
PMC5309133	R07000	We evaluated the classification performance of thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype (based on 3 SNPs) to predict phenotype (Figure S5–S6).
PMC5309133	R07001	The threshold value for thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity to divide patients with intermediate vs normal thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity can vary.
PMC5309133	R07003	Using an optimal threshold to distinguish thiopurine S- methyltransferase phenotypes determined by the ROC curve (15 U/mL for SJ and 13 U/mL for COG), the sensitivity and specificity were improved to 90% and 91% for SJ, and 94% and 91% for COG, respectively (Figure S5).
PMC5309133	R07005	Adding other thiopurine S- methyltransferase variants such as the *8 and *24 alleles, or the three genome-wide significant SNPs (rs11964408, rs6908777 and rs16880220) did not improve the classification performance of clinical thiopurine S- methyltransferase genotype to assess phenotype (Figure S6).
PMC5309133	R08000	Because thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity relates to mercaptopurine toxicity, we studied the association between the top ranked thiopurine S- methyltransferase SNPs and mercaptopurine tolerance.
PMC5309133	R08001	The median dose intensities in thiopurine S- methyltransferase heterozygotes who carried one *2, *3A or *3C allele was 63%, 59% and 72%, respectively, which were lower than in those with *1/*1 genotype (median = 86%, P =
PMC5309133	R08004	Using a threshold of 80% of protocol dose (Figure S7) to distinguish high from low dose intensity, the negative predictive value of thiopurine S- methyltransferase heterozygous genotype is 61%, i.e. 39% patients who had “wild-type” thiopurine S- methyltransferase genetic test still missed >20% of their thiopurine doses.
PMC5309133	R08006	After adjusting for protocol, thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype and clinical features, we did not observe a strong association between dose intensity and other genetic factors for thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity, including rs1345390 (FTO, P = 0.34), rs2892635 (ADCY2, P = 0.09), and rs142134087 (ARHGEF11, P = 0.79).
PMC5309133	R08007	As we reported,(21) the NUDT15 variant rs116855232 was associated with thiopurine dose intensity in the two cohorts (SJ P = 0.030 and COG P = 7.3 × 10−11), but it was not associated with thiopurine S- methyltransferase activity (P = 0.9).
PMC5309133	R08008	Addition of this variant did not affect the association between thiopurine S- methyltransferase clinical genotype and dose intensity (P = 1.7 × 10−13).

PMC5395320	A00000	Thiopurine-related hematotoxicity in paediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and inflammatory bowel diseases has been linked to genetically defined variability in thiopurine S-methyltransferase (thiopurine S-methyltransferase) activity.
PMC5395320	A00001	While gene testing of thiopurine S-methyltransferase is being clinically implemented, it is unclear if additional genetic variation influences thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity with consequences for thiopurine-related toxicity.
PMC5395320	A00002	To examine this possibility, we performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of red blood cell thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in 844 Estonian individuals and 245 paediatric ALL-cases.
PMC5395320	A00003	Additionally, we correlated genome-wide genotypes to human hepatic thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in 123 samples.
PMC5395320	A00004	Only genetic variants mapping to chromosome 6, including thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene region, were significantly associated with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity (P<5.0×10−8) in each of the three GWAS and a joint meta-analysis of 1212 cases (top hit P=1.2×10−72).
PMC5395320	A00005	This finding is consistent with thiopurine S-methyltransferase genotype being the primary determinant of thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity, reinforcing the rationale for genetic testing of TPMT alleles in routine clinical practice to individualize MP dosage.
PMC5395320	D00000	Based on several clinical studies and various disease entities (e.g. ALL in childhood, IBD, autoimmune diseases)19,20 pretreatment determination of the thiopurine S-methyltransferase phenotype and subsequent pharmacogenetically-guided dosing of thiopurines, at least in thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficient individuals, is recommended in routine clinical practice before commencing therapy.5 Very recently a landmark randomized clinical trial strongly corroborates the clinical utility of upfront genetic testing for TPMT in patients treated with thiopurines to avoid hematotoxicity.9 IBD patients who were identified as variant carriers of TPMT and subsequently received dose adjusted thiopurine therapy, showed a 10-fold reduction in hematologic side effects.
PMC5395320	D01000	Nevertheless there are still concerns with regard to whether thiopurine S-methyltransferase genetics exclusively determines the marked interindividual variability of thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity measured in RBC or whether other genes may contribute substantially, particularly in patients carrying the wild-type TPMT genotype.
PMC5395320	D01001	Clinically it is well-known that patients with thiopurine S-methyltransferase wild-type are still at risk for thiopurine-related hematotoxicity and even after consideration of non-genetic factors (e.g. concomitant medication with the XO inhibitor allopurinol or viral infection by cytomegalovirus/parvovirus B19) underlying mechanisms are so far unknown to completely explain thiopurine-related hematotoxicity.
PMC5395320	D01002	Of note, in the retrospective study by Colombel et al.21 only 29.3% of 41 patients with IBD and azathioprine-related severe myelosuppression were carriers of thiopurine S-methyltransferase variant alleles.
PMC5395320	D02000	Some studies have already been performed trying to identify additional genetic or non-genetic factors apart from the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene that influence thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in vivo.
PMC5395320	D02001	For example, S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), the global methyl donor in the human body, has been discovered as a modulator of thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity.11 One previous study using HapMap CEU cell lines and two pediatric ALL-patient cohorts indicate that independent from thiopurine S-methyltransferase a second gene, PACSIN2, which is a member of the ‘protein kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons’ family of proteins, also modulates TPMT activity and is associated with the MP-related gastrointestinal toxicity in children with ALL.14 Additionally, a GWAS was performed and identified genes in the thiopurine pathway that were associated with thiopurine metabolism in lymphoblastoid cell lines from individuals of different ethnic background and clinical response in pediatric ALL patients.13 Altogether, conclusive information is still missing which demonstrates that TPMT genetics is the ideal predictor for TPMT phenotype and replication of novel identified non-TPMT candidate variants have not been performed in independent large-scale studies.
PMC5395320	D03000	The present data from our meta-analysis of three independent GWAS clearly indicate that thiopurine S-methyltransferase genetics seems to have the strongest impact on thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in humans and provide little support for the proposal that other genes may significantly contribute to interindividual variability of TPMT activity.
PMC5395320	D04000	Considering a genome-wide threshold of P<5.0×10−8, our first GWAS for thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity adjusted for age and sex in 844 volunteer-based samples of the Estonia resident adult population revealed 169 variants on chromosome 6, and 150 of those variants map to the genomic region 18.1–18.2
PMC5395320	D04001	Mb including the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene.
PMC5395320	D04002	Since this population cohort comprises subjects with various ICD-10 diagnoses22 not associated with anemia, we can conclude that different diseases do not appear to significantly alter thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in the RBC.
PMC5395320	D04004	Of note, we observed a thiopurine S-methyltransferase genotype-phenotype discordance in ALL patients compared with the Estonia cohort attributed to the disease process of ALL and anemia of patients resulting in lower thiopurine S-methyltransferase activities in RBCs due to degraded TPMT enzyme.23,24
PMC5395320	D05000	Additionally, we investigated for the first time thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in cytosols from 124 human liver samples.
PMC5395320	D05001	Again the GWAS revealed that only variants on chromosome 6 (81 variants at region 18.1–18.2 Mb) were significantly associated with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity.
PMC5395320	D05002	Finally, data from our meta-analysis of all three datasets confirmed these findings, since once again all significantly associated genetic variants were located on chromosome 6, including the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene region.
PMC5395320	D05003	Noticeably, the genome-wide significant hits for thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity extend to genes (e.g. KDM1B) located next to the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene.
PMC5395320	D05005	Further analyses conditioning on the TPMT*3A and *3C alleles were performed, revealing no significantly associated variants (P<5.0×10−8) with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in all three cohorts.
PMC5395320	D06002	However, our findings provide little support for any effect mediated through thiopurine S-methyltransferase, as there was only negligible correlation related to thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in our cohorts (Table 1).
PMC5395320	D07000	Moreover, SNPs localizing to PACSIN2, previously found to influence thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity and be related to MP-related gastrointestinal toxicity,14 were not associated with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in our analyses.
PMC5395320	D08000	Furthermore, very recently the p.Arg139Cys (R139C) variant in the NUDT15 gene was associated with thiopurine-induced leukopenia firstly in a retrospective cohort of Korean IBD patients29 and confirmed by other studies including also children with ALL and MP intolerance.29–31 Very recently, Moriyama et al.30 provided mechanistically evidence how NUDT15 variants independent from thiopurine S-methyltransferase alter levels of active thiopurine metabolites subsequently resulting in increased thiopurine cytotoxicity.
PMC5395320	D08001	No potential interaction of the NUDT15 R139C variant (rs116855232) with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity was found in all of our three cohorts (Table 1) keeping in mind that the allele frequency is extremely low in non-Asians.
PMC5395320	D09000	Additionally, a genome-wide approach was used to identify novel predictors of thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in LCLs resulting in 96 genes ranked higher than thiopurine S-methyltransferase itself.12,30 Except of SLC22A16, none of these genes were located on chromosome 6.
PMC5395320	D09001	Since based on our findings only genetic variants on chromosome 6 determine thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity, these genes appear to be of minor importance to predict thiopurine S-methyltransferase phenotype.
PMC5395320	D09002	Noticeably, no significantly associated variants in SLC22A16 (P<5.0×10−8) with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity were found.
PMC5395320	D10000	In summary, for the first time we provide systematic data on thiopurine S-methyltransferase expression (mRNA, protein) and function (activity levels) in a cohort of 124 human liver samples.
PMC5395320	D10001	Human liver is the predominant site of thiopurine metabolism and data are still lacking demonstrating a close correlation between hepatic thiopurine S-methyltransferase protein expression and cytosolic enzyme activity.
PMC5395320	D10002	thiopurine S-methyltransferase mRNA was not significantly correlated with either thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity or TPMT protein level which supports previous findings demonstrating that the common TPMT polymorphisms 460G>A and 719A>G affect TPMT activity by post-translational modification and increased protein degradation.19 Moreover, no correlation was found between mRNA expression and either TPMT activity or TPMT protein expression measured by Western blotting in subjects carrying the TPMT reference sequence confirmed by next generation sequencing.
PMC5395320	D10003	These data are in contrast to Lindqvist et al.32 reporting a significant correlation between normal/high thiopurine S-methyltransferase enzyme activity in RBC and mRNA levels extracted from whole blood in 29 individuals.
PMC5395320	D10004	It remains questionable if the correlation of mRNA derived from white blood cells and thiopurine S-methyltransferase enzyme activity measured in RBC is reasonable.
PMC5395320	D11000	Limitations of our work may be that this study was designed based on SNP array data and did not investigate gene duplications/deletions or genomic rearrangements which might alter thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity.
PMC5395320	D11001	In addition, to identify novel rare variants in genes other than thiopurine S-methyltransferase that are associated with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity whole genome next-generation sequencing approaches are needed.
PMC5395320	D11002	Moreover, epigenetic regulation of thiopurine S-methyltransferase expression, e.g. by non-coding RNAs such as miRNAs, was not investigated which may be in part a plausible explanation of the missing correlation between thiopurine S-methyltransferase mRNA expression and protein levels in human liver.
PMC5395320	D11005	Thus, we can not exclude that in addition to thiopurine S-methyltransferase further genes are involved in risk of toxicity or treatment outcome.
PMC5395320	D12000	In conclusion, based on the largest meta-GWAS including 1212 subjects from different populations, we did not identify any novel associations for thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity, thereby endorsing genetic testing for thiopurine S-methyltransferase alleles as advocated by the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium5 and the Dutch pharmacogenetics group10 for prediction of patient`s phenotype prior to thiopurine therapy in patients with ALL.

PMC5395320	I00001	Over 30 polymorphisms in thiopurine S-methyltransferase have been documented which have an effect on the enzymatic activity of TPMT.2–4
PMC5395320	I00003	There is a body of evidence that functional polymorphisms in thiopurine S-methyltransferase are a determinant of MP-related hematotoxicity,5 with myelosuppression seen in patients with thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency receiving standard MP therapy.6,7
PMC5395320	I00004	Furthermore, intermediate thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity, only partly explained by thiopurine S-methyltransferase heterozygosity present in 10% of individuals,8 is also associated with an increased risk of toxicity.5,6 Recently, a prospective clinical trial confirmed a lower incidence of leucopenia in pre-treatment TPMT heterozygous-tested patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) after dose-adjusted thiopurine therapy.9
PMC5395320	I01000	While thiopurine S-methyltransferase genotyping is advocated clinically by international guidelines using dosage individualization to limit MP-related toxicity,5,10 thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity shows considerable variability even in those with low risk TPMT genotypes, presumably as a consequence of as yet unidentified additional genetic or non-genetic factors.11 Although several studies have been performed trying to identify additional factors apart from the TPMT gene that influence TPMT activity,12–14 thus far the genome-wide association study (GWAS) approach has not been used to comprehensively investigate the relationship between constitutional genotype and TPMT activity in red blood cells (RBC).
PMC5395320	I01001	Moreover, systematic data regarding the correlation between thiopurine S-methyltransferase genotype and thiopurine S-methyltransferase expression or function in human liver, as the predominant site of thiopurine metabolism, is still missing.
PMC5395320	I02000	To address this deficiency we have conducted the so far largest meta-analysis of three independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity comprising 844 individuals of the Estonian population cohort and 245 pediatric ALL cases, as well as 123 human livers.
PMC5395320	M00002	One inclusion criterion for the thiopurine S-methyltransferase study was that there is no regular use of medications associated with thiopurine S-methyltransferase.
PMC5395320	M02006	Cytosol used for thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity measurements was available for liver samples of 124 patients (n=124; 54 males, 70 females; age: median 58 years, range 7 to 85 years).
PMC5395320	M03000	thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity was measured in hemolysates from all samples of the Estonian cohort, and the ALL-study cohort, and in all liver cytosols with a non-radioactive HPLC method as described previously8 using 6-TG as a substrate.
PMC5395320	M03001	The cut-off for thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency based on thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity measurements in liver cytosol was suggested to be 0 nmol h−1 mg−1, and the cut-off for TPMT activity in RBCs is ≤2 nmol 6-MTG ×
PMC5395320	M06000	In addition, the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene region was analyzed systematically in human liver samples for presence of genetic variations by next-generation sequencing (NGS).
PMC5395320	M07000	High-quality RNA of 150 liver samples was extracted as described previously.37 thiopurine S-methyltransferase mRNA was quantified with the TaqMan® Gene Expression Assay Hs00909011_m1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA).
PMC5395320	M07001	thiopurine S-methyltransferase expression was normalized against β-actin expression, which was measured with the HUMAN ACTB (beta actin)
PMC5395320	M08000	thiopurine S-methyltransferase protein expression was quantified by immunoblot analyses of liver cytosol using a specific rabbit anti-TPMT antibody, which was kindly provided by Richard Weinshilboum (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA).
PMC5395320	M08001	thiopurine S-methyltransferase protein levels, quantified through immunoblotting, were available for 122 samples.
PMC5395320	M09001	For this purpose, thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity measurements were first power transformed (Estonian cohort: λ=1.3, ALL study: λ=0.5, liver cohort: λ=1.65) to fulfill Gaussian distribution assumption.
PMC5395320	M09004	Finally, the association between each of the genetic variants and the transformed thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity measurements, corrected for sex and age, was analyzed in the additive genetic model.
PMC5395320	M09005	Subsequently, we additionally conditioned on additive dosages of the respective thiopurine S-methyltransferase variants (TPMT*3A and TPMT*3C) to test for secondary signals.
PMC5395320	M10000	Results of all three GWAS datasets were combined into a joint meta-analysis using GWAMA software.42 Results for the Estonian study and the ALL study, where the thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity was measured in blood were combined in an inverse of variance weighted fixed effect meta-analysis and the results for the IKP liver cohort with activity measurements in liver cytosol were added in a two degrees of freedom test allowing for the differential effect sizes between the two sample types (blood and liver).43
PMC5395320	M11002	Regional association plots showing −log10P values of genetic variants relative to the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene region were generated using LocusZoom.44 Here, LD (r2) was calculated from the European population in 1000 Genomes (hg19, Nov 2014).
PMC5395320	M12000	Spearman’s correlation test was used to test association between thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity and mRNA or protein expression.
PMC5395320	M12001	R-package beanplot_1.245 was applied to display the association between thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity and common thiopurine S-methyltransferase SNPs, with thick black lines representing the medians per group and the dotted line the overall median.
PMC5395320	R00000	We first investigated the relationship between genome-wide genotypes and thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in individuals from the Estonian cohort.
PMC5395320	R00001	thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity measured in RBC of 844 individuals (414 males, 430 females; age range 18–87 years) of the Estonian cohort showed a bimodal distribution and none of the cohort were shown to be thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficient (Figure 1A).
PMC5395320	R01001	As shown in the Manhattan plot (Figure 1B) and in the regional association plot (Figure 1C), the most significant association, by several orders of magnitude, was provided by genetic variants mapping to thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene region at 6p22.3 in our genome-wide association analysis.
PMC5395320	R01003	In addition, the most important thiopurine S-methyltransferase alleles (TPMT*2,*3A–*3C) were genotyped separately using real-time PCR (TaqMan) technology.
PMC5395320	R01004	Figure 1D shows the association of TPMT*3 alleles with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity, indicating that thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity was significantly lower in heterozygous individuals (median 21, range 13–33 nmol 6-MTG × g−1 Hb × h−1) compared to wild-type carriers (median 40, range 18–64 nmol 6-MTG × g−1 Hb × h−1).
PMC5395320	R01005	Further GWAS analyses conditioning on the most frequent non-functional thiopurine S-methyltransferase alleles (TPMT*3A and *3C) were performed to identify further genetic factors apart from thiopurine S-methyltransferase.
PMC5395320	R01006	However, no significantly associated variants (P<5.0×10−8) with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in our cohort were found (Figure 1E).
PMC5395320	R01008	Moreover, previously identified candidate SNPs were only negligibly related to thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in the Estonian cohort based on our GWAS data (Table 1).
PMC5395320	R02000	Next, we investigated whether the same relationship between genotypes and thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity was shown in pediatric ALL.
PMC5395320	R02002	The distribution of thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity is depicted in Figure 2A. Two of the cases were previously shown to be thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficient.7,16 Next, a genome-wide association study including sex and age as covariates was performed comprising 8,224,478 genotyped and imputed markers.
PMC5395320	R02003	As shown in the Manhattan plot and also in the regional association plot displayed in Figure 2B–2C, only genetic variants within the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene region were significantly associated with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity.
PMC5395320	R02004	All other gene regions were only negligibly associated with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity.
PMC5395320	R02007	Figure 2D shows the association of TPMT*3A–C alleles with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity.
PMC5395320	R02008	In addition, we previously genotyped the most important non-functional thiopurine S-methyltransferase alleles using either TaqMan technology or MALDI-TOF MS and thereby identified one deficient patient as carrier of the TPMT*3A/*11 genotype.7 thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in homozygous carriers of the TPMT*3A allele or in compound heterozygous carriers of two non-functional TPMT alleles (TPMT*3A/*11) displayed an enzyme activity ≤2 nmol 6-MTG × g−1 Hb × h−1.
PMC5395320	R02009	thiopurine S-methyltransferase wild-type carriers showed a significant higher thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity (median 30, range 9–69 6-MTG × g−1 Hb × h−1) compared to heterozygous carriers of non-functional TPMT alleles (median 21, range 9–33 6-MTG × g−1 Hb × h−1).
PMC5395320	R02010	Additional analyses conditioning on the TPMT*3A and *3C alleles revealed no significantly associated variants (P<5.0x10−8) with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in the ALL cohort (Figure 2E).
PMC5395320	R02012	In line with these observations, previously identified candidate SNPs were not associated with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in the ALL cohort based on our GWAS data (Table 1).
PMC5395320	R03000	Following on from these observations we sought to identify genetic markers influencing thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in human liver, the most important thiopurine metabolizing tissue.
PMC5395320	R03001	thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity, determined in liver cytosol of 124 individuals showed a bimodal distribution (Figure 3A) and none of the samples was thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficient.
PMC5395320	R03004	As shown in the Manhattan plot and also in the regional association plot displayed in Figure 3B–3C, only genetic variants within the thiopurine S-methyltransferase region were significantly associated with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity (P<5.0×10−8) (Table S3).
PMC5395320	R04000	The thiopurine S-methyltransferase 238G>C, 460G>A, and 719A>G polymorphisms were additionally genotyped by either TaqMan or MALDI-TOF MS technology.17,18 Carriers of TPMT*2 and TPMT*3A alleles showed a reduced hepatic thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity (Figure 3D) (median 1.2, range 1.1–1.9 nmol h−1mg−1) compared to TPMT wild-type patients (median 2.7, range 1.5–4.1 nmol h−1 mg−1).
PMC5395320	R04001	Moreover, by genotyping 22 functionally relevant thiopurine S-methyltransferase alleles using an established and validated MALDI-TOF MS method,18 as well as next generation sequencing (NGS) of the thiopurine S-methyltransferase coding region, the presence of other functionally relevant TPMT variant alleles could be ruled out.
PMC5395320	R05000	In addition, analyses conditioning on the most frequent non-functional thiopurine S-methyltransferase alleles (TPMT*3A and *3C) revealed no significantly associated variants (P<5.0×10−8) with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in human liver (Figure 3E).
PMC5395320	R05002	In addition, previously identified candidate SNPs were not associated with hepatic thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity based on our GWAS data (Table 1).
PMC5395320	R06000	Systematic data on thiopurine S-methyltransferase expression and function in human liver are still missing and therefore we next correlated cytosolic thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity with TPMT protein levels, determined by immunoblotting.
PMC5395320	R06002	In contrast, thiopurine S-methyltransferase mRNA expression was not significantly correlated with either thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity or TPMT protein level (Figure4B and 4C) in human liver, even after exclusion of TPMT variant cases.
PMC5395320	R07000	Collectively our findings in three independent cohorts indicate that thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity is primarily determined by genetic variation in the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene region in RBCs as well as in liver tissue.
PMC5395320	R07002	Of these, 89% were located on chromosome 6 in the genomic region 18.1–18.2Mb, which includes the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene (Figure 5A).
PMC5395320	R07003	The remaining 11%, which were also located on chromosome 6 (but outside the thiopurine S-methyltransferase region), were only significantly associated with thiopurine S-methyltransferase activity in the Estonian cohort (Figure 5A).
PMC5395320	R08001	Again, this joint meta-analysis of all three datasets only revealed significantly associated genetic variants on chromosome 6, including the thiopurine S-methyltransferase gene region, with the sentinel marker (rs73726531, P=1.2×10−72, effect size: −2.2; Figure 5B; Table S5).
PMC5395320	R08002	As shown in the regional association plot, the sentinel marker is tightly linked to the thiopurine S-methyltransferase variant 719A>G (rs1142345) (Figure 5B).
PMC5402460	A00004	The alleles under natural selection at two of these loci [methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and EPAS1] are strongly associated with blood-related phenotypes, such as hemoglobin, homocysteine, and folate in Tibetans.

PMC5402460	R05006	We found that the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and EPAS1 loci were associated with multiple traits (SI Appendix, Fig. S10), and five of these traits were significant after correcting for multiple testing (PGWAS < 1.5 × 10−4) (SI Appendix, Table S7).
PMC5433429	M04001	One-Step RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq® DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and primers allowing CD46 isoform/isoforms discrimination were used, as previously described (Wang et al. 2000).
PMC5433429	M18001	RT-PCR analysis of CD46 isoforms was performed with the SuperScript® One-Step RT-PCR system with Platinum Taq® DNA polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), as previously described [21] using the 5′

PMC5466475	D03001	When we expanded our search for bone-related functions to genes residing in the TADs surrounding the signal SNPs, where SNP-promoter interactions are more likely to occur, we found four potentially interesting target genes: GPX2 (‘glutathione peroxidase 2’), a member of the glutathione peroxidase family which was found upregulated in adults affected with Kashin-Beck disease (KBD), an endemic, chronic osteochondropathy with unknown etiology diffused in China(42), near the SPTB locus (associated with radius BMD in females); ATG14 (‘autophagy related 14’), whose decreased expression promoted cisplatin-induced apoptosis in a drug-resistant osteosarcoma cell line in vitro(43); KTN1 (‘kinectin 1’), responsible for various functions related to tumorigenesis and found upregulated in giant cells tumors of bone (GCTB), benign bone tumors that cause osteolytic destruction(44); and LGALS3 (‘lectin, galactoside binding soluble 3’), a downstream regulator of matrix metalloproteinase-9 functioning during endochondral bone formation(45); these three genes all reside near the TBPL2 locus (associated with femoral neck BMD).

PMC5600471	A00001	Two major reactions contribute to E1 plasma concentrations, aromatase (CYP19A1) catalyzed E1 synthesis from androstenedione and steroid sulfatase (sulfatase) catalyzed hydrolysis of estrone conjugates (E1Cs).
PMC5600471	A00002	E1Cs have been associated with breast cancer risk and may contribute to tumor progression since sulfatase is expressed in breast cancer where its activity exceeds that of aromatase.
PMC5600471	A01001	Hormone concentrations were measured prior to aromatase inhibitor therapy.
PMC5600471	A03000	These results suggest a mechanism for genetic variation in E1C plasma concentrations as well as possible SNP biomarkers to identify ER+ breast cancer patients for whom sulfatase inhibitors might be of clinical value.
PMC5600471	D03011	They also showed that treatment with an sulfatase inhibitor reduced proliferation of the letrozole-resistant cell lines, results that support the possible clinical application of sulfatase inhibitors.
PMC5600471	D03013	[51] demonstrated that patients with high steroid sulfatase [STS] expression in breast tumors had a higher risk of recurrence than those with low expression.
PMC5600471	D03014	This implies that higher plasma E1C exposure, higher tumor E1C uptake, and higher sulfatase expression might contribute to risk for tumor recurrence.
PMC5600471	D03015	Therefore, sulfatase inhibitors might prove beneficial for ER+ breast cancer patients with high circulating E1C during adjuvant AI therapy.
PMC5600471	D03016	Selection of patients for sulfatase inhibitor trials has been a challenge, and it is possible that rs4149056 could help address this issue.
PMC5600471	D03017	We assume that patients with high circulating concentrations of E1C might benefit from sulfatase inhibition.
PMC5600471	D03018	Thus, patients who are homozygous variant for rs4149056 and are on an aromatase inhibitor could be selected for clinical trials of sulfatase inhibitor as add-on therapy.
PMC5600471	D04002	This pathway remains active in patients who are on aromatase inhibitor therapy.
PMC5600471	D04004	These variants may provide a means by which to identify ER+ breast cancer patients on AI therapy who are at increased risk for tumor recurrence because of elevated tumor E1C exposure, and who might benefit from additional therapy such as sulfatase inhibition.

PMC5600471	I01005	Therefore, drugs that target this source of estrogens, i.e., sulfatase inhibitors [22–25], have been developed as an additional approach to the treatment of ER+ breast cancer.
PMC5600471	R06002	CYP19A1 was of interest since it encodes aromatase, the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of androstenedione to E1 and of testosterone to E2.

PMC5605835	R14002	However, the higher luciferase activity from short reporters than from long reporters — either basal or cotransfected with miR-15a after mutating miR-15a binding sites — suggests that miR-15a does not fully explain the BAFF-var regulatory effects, and other miRNAs or RNA-binding proteins may also influence soluble BAFF levels.

PMC2717907	A01003	This is consistent with the transformations of glucose into Asp or Glu via glycolysis, anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylation (pyruvate carboxylase), and the Krebs cycle.
PMC2717907	A01004	pyruvate carboxylase activation in tumor tissues was also shown by an increased level of pyruvate carboxylase mRNA and protein.
PMC2717907	A02000	pyruvate carboxylase activation – revealed here for the first time in human subjects – may be important for replenishing the Krebs cycle intermediates which can be diverted to lipid, protein, and nucleic acid biosynthesis to fulfill the high anabolic demands for growth in lung tumor tissues.
PMC2717907	D02002	Given the enhanced expression of pyruvate carboxylase, this is best explained with the activation of pyruvate carboxylation, i.e. carboxylation of [U-13C]-pyruvate to generate [13C3]-oxaloacetate, which is transaminated to produce [13C3]-Asp (Fig. ​(Fig.6B).6B).
PMC2717907	D03005	This distinction in the labeled pattern of Glu provided further metabolic evidence for pyruvate carboxylase activation in lung tumor tissues.
PMC2717907	D04000	The metabolomic data were also corroborated by measurements of enhanced gene and protein expression of pyruvate carboxylase in lung tumors relative to their non-cancerous counterparts.
PMC2717907	D04001	In this case, the 13C-isotopomer data was pivotal in directing the interrogations of pyruvate carboxylase gene expression by RT-PCR and protein analysis by Western blotting.
PMC2717907	D04002	Thus, such metabolomics-edited gene and protein expression analysis (which we have demonstrated for cultured lung cancer cells [22]) is equally useful for uncovering pyruvate carboxylase up regulation in human patients.
PMC2717907	D05000	Although previously unknown in human lung cancer, pyruvate carboxylase activation was recently reported in hepatic tumors in rat [39] and in estradiol-stimulated breast cancer cells [40].
PMC2717907	D05001	pyruvate carboxylase expression or suppression has also been respectively associated with enhanced metabolism/proliferation of mammalian cells [41] or inhibition of tumor cell growth [42].
PMC2717907	D05003	These effects of pyruvate carboxylase are presumably mediated through its ability to replenish the Krebs cycle intermediates, thereby enhancing energy metabolism and fulfilling biosynthetic demands from proliferating cells [41].
PMC2717907	D05004	From this perspective, it is reasonable to postulate that pyruvate carboxylase activation may be important for the transformation of lung primary cells into a more highly proliferative state.

PMC2717907	M07001	This included an over expression of the pyruvate carboxylase (pyruvate carboxylase) gene in lung cancer versus paired non-cancerous tissues.
PMC2717907	M07002	Due to sample limitation, the array analysis was not performed for patients #6–10, for which metabolic evidence for pyruvate carboxylase activation was obtained.
PMC2717907	M08000	Real time (RT)-PCR was used instead to probe pyruvate carboxylase gene expression in patients #6–10.
PMC2717907	M08005	RNA was reverse transcribed into first strand cDNA using oligo(dT)18 and SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen).

PMC2717907	M10005	The film was digitized using a high-resolution scanner and the image density of appropriate bands (130 kDa for pyruvate carboxylase and 50 kDa for α-tubulin) was analyzed using Image J (NIH, Bethesda, MD).
PMC2717907	M10006	The image density of the pyruvate carboxylase protein band was normalized to that of the α-tubulin protein band.
PMC2717907	R10001	This was examined by real-time PCR analysis of key mitochondrial dehydrogenases (DH) along with the anaplerotic pyruvate carboxylase (pyruvate carboxylase) and glutaminase for tumor and surrounding non-tumorous tissues, as shown in Table ​Table5.5.
PMC2717907	R10002	Increased expression of the two isoforms of pyruvate carboxylase gene was evident in patients #6–10 with an average fold change of 3.36 ± 1.13 i.e. significantly higher in tumors (p < 0.01).
PMC2717907	R10003	In contrast, the expression of the other important anaplerotic enzyme gene, glutaminase (glutaminase) was lower in the tumors relative to the surrounding non-cancerous tissues, with an average fold change of 0.52 ± 0.16.
PMC2717907	R10004	For Krebs cycle DH, there was a substantial decrease of isocitrate DH (IDH) and α-ketoglutarate DH (OGDH) in contrast to a modest activation of malate DH (MDH) expression, while succinate DH (SDH) and fumarate hydratase (fumarate hydratase) showed no statistically significant changes in expression in tumor tissues.
PMC2717907	R11000	These data differ from a recent report on glioblastoma cells in culture, where glutaminolysis was shown to be significant while pyruvate carboxylation was undetected [13], even though the parent astrocytes have high pyruvate carboxylase activity [12,32].
PMC2717907	R12000	The in vivo 13C isotopomer profile and gene expression data (see above) indicate increased pyruvate carboxylase activity in the NSCLC tumors compared with non-tumorous lung tissue.
PMC2717907	R12001	To determine whether pyruvate carboxylase gene activation leads to an enhanced expression of the enzyme, Western blotting was performed on paired tumor and non-cancerous tissues from the five patients.
PMC2717907	R12002	The pyruvate carboxylase response normalized to that of α-tubulin is shown in Figure ​Figure7B.7B. Lung tumor tissues from patients #6, 9, and 10 exhibited a significant enrichment of pyruvate carboxylase protein over the non-cancerous counterpart.
PMC2717907	R12003	Patient #8 had a high interfering background over the pyruvate carboxylase band region for the non-cancerous tissue, which made it difficult to quantify the pyruvate carboxylase response.
PMC2717907	R12004	The normalized pyruvate carboxylase response for patient #7 was comparable between the paired non-cancerous and tumor tissues.

PMC2724746	I09000	In addition to glycine-N-methyl transferase, sarcosine levels are regulated by sarcosine dehydrogenase (sarcosine dehydrogenase), the enzyme that converts sarcosine back to glycine and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (DMGDH) which generates sarcosine from dimethylglycine (Fig. 4a).

PMC2724746	I10000	With the understanding that androgen signaling and ETS gene (ERG, ETV1) fusions are key factors for prostate cancer progression12, we investigated their role in regulating glycine-N-methyl transferase and sarcosine dehydrogenase.
PMC2724746	I10001	Treatment with androgen for 48h in VCaP (ERG positive) and LNCaP (ETV1 positive) prostate cancer cells resulted in a step-wise increase in glycine-N-methyl transferase expression and a concomitant decrease in sarcosine dehydrogenase levels as assessed by digital gene expression and QPCR (Fig 4d, Supplementary Fig. 25e).
PMC2724746	I10002	This finding was supported by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChiP-Seq) which revealed direct binding of AR and ERG to the promoter of glycine-N-methyl transferase in VCaP cells (Fig. 4e), while only ERG binding was seen on the sarcosine dehydrogenase promoter (Fig. 4f).
PMC2724746	I10003	In ETV1 positive LNCaP cells, AR, but not ERG as expected, was bound to both glycine-N-methyl transferase and sarcosine dehydrogenase promoters (Supplementary Figs.

PMC2755199	A01001	Plasma levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA, endogenous nitric oxide synthase [NOS] inhibitor), symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA, which lacks nitric oxide synthase inhibitory activity), N-mono-methylarginine (MMA, a potent nitric oxide synthase inhibitor), methyl-lysine (Methyl-Lys, an unrelated methylated amino acid), arginine and its major catabolites (citrulline and ornithine) were quantified simultaneously by stable isotope dilution HPLC with on-line electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry and adjusted for traditional risk factors, C-reactive protein, and estimated creatinine clearance.
PMC2755199	A02001	These results suggest that factors beyond direct nitric oxide synthase inhibition contribute to the clinical associations between methylarginines and CAD outcomes.
PMC2755199	D00006	The significant associations between both prevalent significantly obstructive CAD and incident major adverse events and (i) elevations in plasma levels of SDMA (in the absence of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitory effect); (ii) reductions in plasma levels of the potent nitric oxide synthase inhibitor MMA; and (iii) increased levels of ArgMI, a ratio that serves as an overall gauge for more extensive post translational methylation of arginine, suggests that the relationship between arginine methylation pathways and CAD initiation and progression extends well beyond direct NOS inhibition.
PMC2755199	D00008	Taken together, our data demonstrate that not just the endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor ADMA but other methylated arginine metabolites can collectively provide clinically important information relevant in the assessment of prevalent significantly obstructive CAD and long-term cardiovascular risks.
PMC2755199	D01001	There has been a long-standing belief that the direct inhibition of nitric oxide synthase is the primary mechanism for the heightened cardiovascular risks associated with elevated ADMA levels.
PMC2755199	D01005	These findings are somewhat unexpected, as SDMA (a stereoisomer of ADMA) has been demonstrated to have no inhibitory effects on nitric oxide synthase 21.
PMC2755199	D01006	However, it is clear that ADMA and SDMA are naturally occurring analogues of L-arginine, the substrate for NO synthesis by nitric oxide synthases (NOSs).
PMC2755199	D02002	Among the methylarginines, MMA is the most potent nitric oxide synthase inhibitor and is widely employed as a pharmacological inhibitor of NOSs.21, 22.
PMC2755199	D02003	While present at lower levels in plasma, our study clearly identifies the unexpected inverse relationship between plasma levels of this potent nitric oxide synthase inhibitor and CAD risks (Table 2).

PMC2755199	I00000	Nitric oxide (NO), produced by the oxidation of arginine by NO synthases of endothelial cells, plays an important anti-atherogenic role in the development of cardiovascular disease.
PMC2755199	I00003	The mechanistic explanation has been attributed to its role as an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (nitric oxide synthase), reducing the production of NO thereby diminishing vascular reactivity and leading to endothelial dysfunction and vasculopathy8.
PMC2755199	I01001	For example, N-mono-methylarginine (MMA), the immediate precursor to ADMA, is a more potent albeit less abundant endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibitor.
PMC2755199	I01002	Symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), an alternative methylation product of MMA and a stereoisomer of ADMA, lacks nitric oxide synthase inhibitory activity, but like ADMA, is a weak inhibitor of arginine transporters10.
PMC2755199	I01004	In contrast, methylation of other amino acids such as the production of methyl-lysine occurs via alternative methyltransferases and has no known relationship with arginine-NO metabolic pathways.
PMC2755199	I01005	The methyltransferases responsible for arginine methylation, the proteases involved in liberation of the free methylargnine derivatives and the catabolic dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases involved in metabolism of ADMA are all apparently influenced by conditions associated with inflammation and oxidative stress11, raising the possibility that some of the observed associations between ADMA levels and cardiovascular disease may occur in part via mechanisms independent of endogenous nitric oxide synthase inhibition.
PMC2755213	A02000	Plasma levels of free arginine, ornithine, citrulline and the endogenous NO synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) were measured using LC/MS/MS.
PMC2755213	D00004	These findings were independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, renal function, markers of inflammation, and even when accounting for levels of the endogenous NO synthase inhibitor ADMA.
PMC2755213	D01000	Increasing arginine as substrate for NO synthases has been postulated to increase in endothelial NO production(1).
PMC2755213	D01003	Under physiologic conditions, the intracellular NO synthases should be adequately saturated with its arginine substrates.
PMC2755213	D01005	Several investigators have postulated that endogenous inhibitors of NO synthases, methylated arginine metabolites such as ADMA, may provide the explanation(16).
PMC2755213	D03000	Arginases, in particular, have been shown to be upregulated in several disease states with components of inflammation including CAD, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and asthma(25).
PMC2755213	D03001	Indeed, arginases are subject to regulation by inflammatory cytokines as well as inter-regulation by the arginine metabolites themselves(26).
PMC2755213	D03002	Increased arginase activity in endothelial cells has been argued to promote a pro-atherogenic effect because of direct reduction of endothelial cell NO production via the conversion of arginine to ornithine(2).
PMC2755213	D03003	Indeed, it has been suggested that indirect strategies for elevating arginine (such as the inhibition of arginase) could prove more effective at improving intracellular arginine bioavailability than exogenous arginine administration(2).
PMC2755213	D03007	One suggestion has been the impact of this decreased availability of arginine on the synthesis of NO by interfering with NO synthase mRNA translation via altered phosphorylation and activity of eukaryotic initiation factor(28).

PMC2755213	I01001	In several disease states arginase levels are increased and have been proposed to limit NO formation through increased arginine consumption.
PMC2755213	I01002	This limiting of NO formation results in indirect competition with NO synthases, the formation of ornithine, and subsequently citrulline (12,13).

PMC2836072	A00004	7α-Hydroxy-3-oxocholest-4-en-26-oic acid is formed from 3β,7α-dihydroxycholest-5-en-26-oic acid in a reaction catalyzed by 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid dehydrogenase (HSD3B7), which may thus represent a deactivation pathway of LXR ligands in brain.

PMC2939474	A00000	Many studies have examined the relationship between polymorphisms in glutathione S-transferase genes and cancer in people exposed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) such as benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), but the results to date have been modest.
PMC2939474	A00007	Taken together with our similar previous results of analyses of phenanthrene metabolites in human hepatocytes and human urine, the results of this study indicate that conjugation of BPDE with glutathione is a minor pathway in humans, indicating that glutathione S-transferase genotyping is not an effective method for assessing risk of PAH-induced cancer in humans, at least with respect to the diol epoxide pathway of PAH carcinogenesis.
PMC2939474	D01001	This was followed by a series of studies using purified human GSTs (Robertson et al., 1986), cellular subfractions with glutathione S-transferase activity (Jernström et al., 1989), recombinant GSTs and their variants (Jernström et al., 1996; Sundberg et al., 1997, 1998), and Chinese hamster V79 cells overexpressing human GSTs (Seidel et al., 1998; Sundberg et al., 2001, 2002).
PMC2939474	D01002	These studies demonstrated that bay region and fjord region diol epoxides can be converted to GSH conjugates by glutathione S-transferase M1, glutathione S-transferase P1, and GST A1, and that such conjugation was in most cases protective against DNA damage and mutagenicity.

PMC2939474	I01000	Our approach to investigating the role of GSTs in PAH carcinogenesis started with a phenotyping strategy in which we proposed to characterize and quantify the urinary mercapturic acids resulting from GST-catalyzed detoxification of PAH diol epoxides, followed by normal metabolic processing of the initially formed glutathione S-transferase conjugates by γ-glutamyltranspeptidase, cysteinylglycine dipeptidase, and cysteine S-conjugate N-acetyltransferase (Hecht et al., 2008).

PMC3319463	I01000	MEL’s use in sleep regulation is particularly important in patients with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).5–9 About two-thirds of patients with ASD suffer from sleep disturbance with the most common clinical subtype being insomnia.5 In a recent meta-analysis of MEL treatment in ASD, 12 out of 18 studies reported an overall improvement rate of 84.2% (95% CI 81.4–88.9%) in sleep for the 349 participants, where improvement was qualified by fewer night wakings, earlier sleep onset and greater sleep duration.5 Generally, lower levels of MEL are observed in patients with ASD versus controls, but the reason is unclear.6–9 One report showed an association of a low urinary melatonin metabolite (6-sulfatoxymelatonin) and deeper levels of non-rapid eye movement sleep.10 Reduced production of MEL has been attributed to a range of factors including alterations in serotonergic or acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase activity.7, 11, 12
PMC3319463	R12007	Melke and coworkers investigated the effects of acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase (acetylserotonin O-methyltransferase) mutations on the enzymatic synthesis of MEL from its precursor NAS, but was unable to make a direct correlation to ASD onset.7 These results and the novel capability of this method to measure endogenous levels of MEL and its precursor NAS introduce the potential to begin mapping out the dynamics of the MEL production pathway in children with ASD.

PMC3325153	A00000	Paraoxon (diethyl 4-nitrophenyl phosphate) is an active metabolite of the common insecticide parathion and is acutely toxic due to the inhibition of cholinesterase (cholinesterase) activity in the nervous systems.
PMC3325153	A00001	The inhibition of butyrylcholinesterase (butyrylcholinesterase) activity by paraoxon is due to the formation of phosphorylated butyrylcholinesterase adduct, and the detection of the phosphorylated BChE adduct in human plasma can serve as an exposure biomarker of organophosphate pesticides and nerve agents.
PMC3325153	A00002	In this study, we developed an immunoaffinity purification and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) strategy for identifying phosphorylated butyrylcholinesterase in human plasma treated by paraoxon.
PMC3325153	A00003	butyrylcholinesterase was captured by biotinylated anti-BChE polyclonal antibodies conjugated to streptavidin magnetic beads.
PMC3325153	A00004	Western blot analysis showed that the antibody was effective to recognize both native and modified butyrylcholinesterase with high specificity.
PMC3325153	A00005	Using a purified butyrylcholinesterase protein, we initially identified the exact phosphorylation site on the serine residue (S198) with a 108 Da modification by both MS/MS and accurately measured parent ion masses and quantified the extent of phosphorylation on S198 following paraoxon treatment to be >99.9%.
PMC3325153	A00006	Then, the phosphorylated butyrylcholinesterase peptide in paraoxon-treated human plasma following immunoaffinity purification was successfully identified based on the accurate measured mass and retention time information initially obtained from the purified butyrylcholinesterase protein.
PMC3325153	A00007	Thus, immunoaffinity purification combined with LC-MS represents a viable approach for the detection and quantification of phosphorylated butyrylcholinesterase as an exposure biomarker of organophosphates and nerve agents.
PMC3325153	I00001	OPs are highly toxic because they rapidly inactivate the cholinesterase (cholinesterase) activity via the phosphorylation of the serine hydroxyl group located in the catalytic triad of the active center by OP agents [2, 3].
PMC3325153	I00002	Acetylcholinesterase (AChE, EC 3.1.1.7) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE, EC 3.1.1.8) are serine hydrolases in which the active center contains a serine residue [4, 5].
PMC3325153	I00004	butyrylcholinesterase, also called pseudocholinesterase, catalyzes the hydrolysis of a variety of choline and noncholine esters in the same way as AChE
PMC3325153	I00006	butyrylcholinesterase is known to react more effectively than AChE with a broad range of OP toxicants [3] and thus has been suggested as an effective scavenger of OP toxicants [2].
PMC3325153	I00007	Higher reactivity with OP compounds and relatively longer residence time (11-day half life in plasma [8]) makes butyrylcholinesterase an ideal biomarker for monitoring OP poisoning
PMC3325153	I01000	Over the years, different biomarkers have been used as indicators of OP poisoning such as OP metabolites in blood and urine, decreased cholinesterase activity in serum, free unbound OPs in blood, and OP-ChE adducts, and different analytical methods have been developed to identify them
PMC3325153	I01006	Alternatively, direct detection of phosphorylated peptide from butyrylcholinesterase at the catalytic site after proteolysis represents a promising means for assessing OP poisoning because the protein adduct has long-term presence in blood.
PMC3325153	I02000	Despite overall high sensitivity offered by MS technologies, the purification of butyrylcholinesterase from complex plasma samples is still necessary due to the low abundance and low stoichiometry of phosphorylation.
PMC3325153	I02002	This method is capable of separating both the unmodified and modified butyrylcholinesterase, but is labor intensive and less suitable for high-throughput LC-MS/MS analysis.
PMC3325153	I02003	To overcome this limitation, an immunoaffinity purification method has recently been developed [10, 20] to facilitate the MS detection of the modified butyrylcholinesterase.
PMC3325153	I03000	In this work, we focused on the detection of phosphorylated butyrylcholinesterase from human plasma treated by paraoxon.
PMC3325153	I03001	Paraoxon, a bioactive metabolite of the OP insecticide parathion [21], is used as a model compound for generating phosphorylated butyrylcholinesterase adducts.
PMC3325153	I03002	Paraoxon is known as a cholinesterase inhibitor [22] and has been commonly used as a model compound to study OP poisoning because of less toxicity (in rats, 50% lethal dose is 1.8 mg/kg compared to 0.001 mg/kg for O-ethyl S-[2–(diisopropylamino)ethyl] methylphosphonothioate; VX), and less volatility than many other OP compounds [23, 24].
PMC3325153	I04000	To enable more effective detection of phosphorylated butyrylcholinesterase in human plasma, we developed an improved antibody conjugation approach based on streptavidin-biotin interaction, which provided a higher affinity than the previous protein G antibody conjugation [10, 20].
PMC3325153	I04001	In this approach, a polyclonal antibody for butyrylcholinesterase was biotinylated with chromophore-linked biotin and conjugated to streptavidin magnetic beads to form a stable complex.
PMC3325153	I04002	Western blotting experiments confirmed effective purification of both modified and unmodified butyrylcholinesterase with high recovery.
PMC3325153	I04004	A butyrylcholinesterase recombinant protein treated with paraoxon was used to initially confirm the exact site of phosphorylation occurred at the serine residue (S198) as well as the accurate masses and LC retention times of both the modified and unmodified butyrylcholinesterase peptides.
PMC3325153	I04005	The accurate mass and retention time information allowed the detection of phosphorylated butyrylcholinesterase peptide in human plasma by accurate mass measurements using high resolution MS instead of relying on MS/MS due to the potential under-sampling issue of low-abundance peptides in complex samples.
PMC3325153	M00001	The goat polyclonal anti-BChE antibody with epitope mapping near the N-terminal sequence of human butyrylcholinesterase (N-15) (catalog# sc-46803) was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA).

PMC3325153	M05000	For the purification of butyrylcholinesterase from standard sample, 10 µg of either untreated or paraoxon treated butyrylcholinesterase (OP-BChE) was suspended in 50 µl water and mixed with 20 µl of Mag_STAVD/BT_Ab_BChE complex conjugated with the polyclonal antibody (see above).

PMC3325153	M08000	Standard butyrylcholinesterase or purified butyrylcholinesterase from human plasma were digested following the same protocol.
PMC3325153	M08001	40 µl aliquots containing about 10 µg of purified butyrylcholinesterase were lyophylized and reconstituted in 40 µl of 50 mM NH4HCO3 (pH 7.8).
PMC3325153	R00000	In order to specifically detect the phosphorylated butyrylcholinesterase peptide in human plasma, target enrichment is an important step prior to LC-MS/MS analysis.
PMC3325153	R00002	1 illustrates the overall strategy for immunoaffinity purification of butyrylcholinesterase.
PMC3325153	R00003	Briefly, butyrylcholinesterase is captured by streptavidin magnetic beads conjugated with biotin-anti-BChE antibodies, which bind to both the native and modified butyrylcholinesterase.
PMC3325153	R01004	Based on the absorption intensities and extinction coefficients, the mole ratio of biotin and butyrylcholinesterase antibody was calculated as 6.
PMC3325153	R02000	To optimize and assess the efficiency of the enrichment method, the magnetic beads immobilized with antibodies (Mag_STAV/BT_Ab_BChE) was initially incubated with commercially available butyrylcholinesterase (paraoxon treated or untreated), and the purified butyrylcholinesterase was resolved in a 1D SDS-PAGE gel.
PMC3325153	R02002	2A. Profiles on the unmodified butyrylcholinesterase without purification (lane 1a), the supernatant after capturing butyrylcholinesterase (lane 1b) and the eluted BChE after capture (lane 1c), and the corresponding panels 1a’, 1b’ and 1c’ for the modified BChE, respectively, clearly demonstrated the ability of magnetic beads to effectively capture both the unmodified and OP-modified BChE and a high recovery of captured BChE following elution.
PMC3325153	R03000	To extract butyrylcholinesterase from human plasma, 500 µl of plasma treated with paraoxon were subjected to immunoaffinity purification and the 1D SDS-PAGE results were shown in Fig.
PMC3325153	R03004	2B, silver staining of the gel lanes showed no visible difference in the protein patterns between the non-enriched (control) and unbound fractions (lane 2a and 2b), but only two major bands were detected in the eluted fraction (lane 2c), which corresponded to the plasma butyrylcholinesterase.
PMC3325153	R03005	The overall results suggest that the current strategy is applicable to effectively purify both the unmodified as well as OP-modified butyrylcholinesterase from biological or clinical samples.
PMC3325153	R04000	Due to the often encountered challenge in the detection of low-abundance phosphorylated peptides in complex mixture by tandem mass spectrometry, we initially characterized the recombinant butyrylcholinesterase with or without paraoxon treatment by LC-MS/MS in order to identify the exact site of paraoxon modification and obtain the accurate mass and LC retention time of the modified peptide.
PMC3325153	R04001	Tryptic digests of both the untreated butyrylcholinesterase and OP-BChE were first subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis.
PMC3325153	R04003	3A showed the structure and reaction path of butyrylcholinesterase and paraoxon after exposure.
PMC3325153	R05001	4 compares the intensities of extracted ion chromatograms of the unmodified butyrylcholinesterase peptide from the untreated and treated butyrylcholinesterase samples.
PMC3325153	R05002	The intensity of unmodified butyrylcholinesterase peptide was reduced by more than three orders of magnitude following paraoxon treatment, indicating that the treatment led to a nearly complete level of phosphorylation on Ser198, in agreement with the observation of a complete inhibition of enzyme activity.
PMC3325153	R06000	We have also explored whether there are endogenous phosphorylation and other sites of OP-modifications within human butyrylcholinesterase. With a sequence coverage of ~88% achieved, our data indicate that human butyrylcholinesterase does not contain any sites of endogenous phosphorylation and Ser198 is the only site for OP-modification induced by paraoxon treatment.
PMC3325153	R07000	To demonstrate the ability for detecting the phosphorylated butyrylcholinesterase peptide in human plasma, immunoaffinity purification was applied to the paraoxon treated plasma sample and the final digest was analyzed by high resolution LC-MS and MS/MS.
PMC3325153	R07004	The unmodified form of the butyrylcholinesterase peptide was not detected in this sample, again indicating a nearly completed phosphorylation following the paraoxon treatment.
PMC3325153	R07005	While the identification of this peptide was observed by a single MS/MS spectrum, the accurate mass measurements of the parent ions provide more confidence of the identification as well as potential quantification of the level of phosphorylation butyrylcholinesterase in plasma without the need of MS/MS identification.
PMC3325153	R07006	Since antibody pulls down the whole butyrylcholinesterase protein from human plasma, a number of other butyrylcholinesterase peptides (supplementary Table) were identified by MS/MS, supporting the confidence of our detection of modified-BChE in human plasma sample.
PMC3325153	R08000	Taken together, our data provide a detailed characterization of butyrylcholinesterase phosphorylation and demonstrate the effective detection and potential quantification of low-abundance OP-modified butyrylcholinesterase peptide in complex human plasma by coupling of an effective immunoaffinity purification protocol with high-resolution LC-MS.
PMC3325153	R08002	Firstly, the stronger non-covalent interaction of biotin-antibody conjugate with the streptavidin magnetic beads forms the basis for highly selective capture and high recovery of butyrylcholinesterase.
PMC3325153	R08005	Since our approach allows the detection of both the unmodified and modified forms of the butyrylcholinesterase peptide, the extent of phosphorylation is quantifiable, especially if appropriate internal standards can be included for LC-MS analyses [10].
PMC3325153	R08007	The full length tryptic peptide of butyrylcholinesterase 191SVTLFGES*AGAASVSLHLLSPGSHSLFTR219 was difficult to identify by LC-MS/MS and enzymes such as pepsin and chymotrypsin were used to generate shorter peptides for easier identification.
PMC3325153	R08009	[20] whereas pepsin generated 195FGES*AGAAS203 as modified butyrylcholinesterase peptides; however, the non- specific cleavage activities of these enzymes may generate a number of different cleavage products introducing additional variations on quantification.
PMC3325153	R08010	Our work is the first report of confident identification of the phosphorylated butyrylcholinesterase tryptic peptide following paraoxon treatment, which can be used as a surrogate peptide for accurate quantification.

PMC3334549	I00003	Moreover, phospholipase A2 activity is increased particularly in the first-onset patients with schizophrenia and associates with structural brain changes, particularly in the prefrontal cortex and thalamus [5].
PMC3334549	I00006	Phospholipid abnormalities and prostaglandin deficiency may be related since prostaglandins are synthesized via hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) by action of phospholipase A2, with another byproduct of this process being lysophosphatidylcholines (lysoPCs).
PMC3348551	A00002	NNAL undergoes further uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)-mediated metabolism to give N- and O-glucuronide metabolites, which together with free (non-conjugated) NNAL are then excreted in the urine.
PMC3348551	I00000	Tobacco use is the single largest preventable cause of disease and premature death in the United States, accounting for at least 30% of cancer deaths.[1] The nearly 40% reduction in male lung cancer deaths between 1991 and 2003 has been attributed to smoking declines in the last half century.[2] 4-(Methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), a carcinogenic nitrosamine produced upon curing tobacco, is present at relatively high concentrations in tobacco smoke.[3] Therefore, it has been suggested that NNK is an important contributor to the etiology of lung and pancreatic cancer in smokers, oral cancer in smokeless tobacco users, and lung cancer in non-smokers exposed to environmental tobacco smoke.[4] The ketone that is present at C-1 of NNK is rapidly reduced to an alcohol in the lung primarily by aldo-keto reductases (AKRs) of the 1C family,[5] carbonyl reductase 1 (CBR1), and 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD1)[6] to give the carcinogenic NNAL metabolite (Fig. 1).

PMC3392268	D06002	Xanthine is the substrate of xanthine oxidase, which produces hydrogen peroxide and hence is implicated in mechanisms of oxidative stress.
PMC3392268	D06003	Since free radicals are known to decouple nitric oxide synthase enzymatic activity, a lower basal level of xanthine and purine degradation may yield an environment for more robust nitric oxide synthase signaling.
PMC3392268	D06004	Xanthine oxidase inhibitors are an emerging treatment for cardiac ischemia [36], [37] and xanthine oxidase has been considered as a therapeutic target for cardiovascular disease [38].
PMC3392268	D06006	Furthermore, recent results indicate that hyperuricemia resulting from increased purine degradation attenuates NO production by inhibiting arginine transport at the nitric oxide synthase associated CAT-1 transporter [39].

PMC3536923	D05008	These results are in line with the previously reported aldehyde dehydrogenase activities [15].
PMC3536923	D05009	These data support the notion that intracellular aldehyde dehydrogenase is responsible for the metabolism of BEN to BA in these cells and that this intracellular conversion mediates its cytotoxic effects.

PMC3568495	I01001	Studies carried out in cell culture, yeast, and Drosophila models of polyglutamine diseases have indicated that histone deacetylase (histone deacetylase) inhibitors might provide a useful class of therapeutic agents for HD due to the association of histone acetylation with gene transcription [6; 7; 8; 9; 10].
PMC3568495	I01004	When a transgenic Drosophilia model that exhibited this protein-protein interaction was treated with an histone deacetylase inhibitor, degeneration and early adult death were decreased [7].
PMC3568495	I01005	These results suggest that reduced acetyl transferase activity may be an important component to polyglutamine disease pathogenesis.
PMC3568495	I01006	Thus, histone deacetylase inhibitors may possibly be used to lessen the transcriptional changes in HD
PMC3568495	I02000	Sodium phenyl butyrate (SPB) has been explored as an histone deacetylase inhibitor in clinical trials for cytostatic antineoplastic agents and has shown the ability to potentiate the effects of cytotoxic agents on tumors [12; 13].
PMC3568495	I02002	This evidence, in addition to recent results suggesting that the global reduction of histone deacetylase activity slows the rate of neurodegeneration in in vivo models of HD [7; 9; 10; 17], suggested SPB as a therapeutic agent for HD.

PMC3587164	R17002	The difference in the correlations of the two major products of 25(OH)D3 oxidation with their precursor can be rationalized by much stricter biological control of 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1α-hydroxylase compared to 25-hydroxyvitamin D 24-hydroxylase (Fig. 1).
PMC3587164	R17004	Thus, in the case of elevated 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1α-hydroxylase activity that is associated with some disease states, excess 25(OH)D3 may lead to 1α,25(OH)2D3-associated toxicity.
PMC3587164	R18001	Also, the level of 24R,25(OH)2D3 can be a measure of 1α,25(OH)2D3 clearance because 1α,25(OH)2D3 is also oxidized by 25-hydroxyvitamin D 24-hydroxylase, forming the inactive 1α,24R,25(OH)3D3.

PMC3608864	R03003	This may be partly explained by significantly high tumor levels of S386 phosphorylation in phosphofructokinase, which enhances its activity (Brand and Soling 1975), and thus the overall glycolytic flux because it is a bottleneck enzyme.

PMC3637650	A00006	The CSF levels of the citric, isocitric, and lactic acids were significantly higher in grade I–III gliomas with mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase than in those with wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase.
PMC3637650	D01007	Interestingly, the present study demonstrated that the CSF levels of lactic acid were significantly increased in gliomas with a mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase compared with wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase in only low-grade gliomas (grades I–III).

PMC3637650	D03001	In the present study, the differences in the metabolic profiles by the isocitrate dehydrogenase status were analyzed in grades I–III gliomas, excluding GBMs, because all GBMs did not have a isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation and because several metabolites were significantly different from other grades of gliomas.

PMC3682342	D00000	Discovery of neomorphic 2HG production as a consequence of recurrent isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations in AML and in other malignancies has strengthened the proposed link between abnormal cellular metabolism, epigenetic reprogramming, and oncogenic transformation.
PMC3682342	D00001	Elevated serum 2HG levels in patients with IDH1 and IDH2 mutations have been described previously in several small AML cohorts13,14,18,36,37; however, the relationship between serum 2HG levels, isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, and patient outcome has not been defined previously.
PMC3682342	D01000	Our analysis confirms a clear relationship between the presence of an isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation (IDH1 R132, IDH2 R172, or IDH2 R140) and an elevated serum 2HG level, with 97% of patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations having a detectable 2HG level at the time of AML diagnosis, and a median 2HG concentration nearly 50-fold higher than that of patients with IDH wild-type mutations.
PMC3682342	D01001	An association between diagnostic WBC count and serum 2HG levels was identified in patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, suggesting that circulating WBC count as a measure of “tumor burden” may relate to the level of serum 2HG in these patients.
PMC3682342	D01002	We also found low but detectable levels of serum 2HG in the majority of patients with wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase AML, as well as in normal volunteers.
PMC3682342	D01003	These data suggest that the LC-MS technique can detect minimal and nonpathologic levels of this metabolite in patients without isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations.
PMC3682342	D02000	We found that pretreatment serum 2HG levels >700 ng/mL best predict isocitrate dehydrogenase mutational status.
PMC3682342	D02001	Notably, subsequent mutation testing in 13 patients initially characterized as having isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type mutations and with diagnostic 2HG levels >700 ng/mL reclassified 9 patients as having isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, albeit at low allelic burden.
PMC3682342	D02005	Additional sequencing and analysis of the 4 samples with 2HG levels >700 ng/mL and without identified isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations are ongoing.
PMC3682342	D03000	Our data suggest that diagnostic serum 2HG measurements may allow for rapid, accurate identification of patients with AML with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations.
PMC3682342	D04000	Drugs targeting mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase are currently being tested in the preclinical setting with promising results,28,29 thus increasing the significance of serum 2HG levels in the selection of patients for such treatment.
PMC3682342	D05001	Recent data demonstrate that IDH+/NPM1+ mutations confer an especially favorable prognosis,11 although the frequency of co-occurring NPM1 mutations within our IDH2 R140 subgroup was not significantly different from the group with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations overall.
PMC3682342	D06000	In patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, a decrease of serum 2HG levels to <200 ng/mL at CR was predictive of improved OS (P = .02).

PMC3682342	I00000	Recurrent somatic mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (isocitrate dehydrogenase) enzymes IDH1 and IDH2 have been identified in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and other myeloid malignancies, with an estimated prevalence of 5% to 30%.1-9IDH1 and IDH2 mutations occur more frequently in patients with normal karyotype and older age3,6,8,10 and are associated with co-occurring nucleophosmin (NPM1) mutations.2-4,11,12
PMC3682342	I01000	isocitrate dehydrogenase enzymes function within the citric acid cycle, catalyzing the oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate to α-ketoglutarate (αKG) while converting nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP)+ to reduced NADP (NADPH).
PMC3682342	I01001	Somatic mutations within the IDH1 and IDH2 enzyme–active sites, specifically at codon R132 of IDH1 and codons R140 or R172 of IDH2, lead to a loss of function for the above-described reaction and yield a reverse reaction that reduces αKG to 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) via the conversion of NAPDH to NADP+.13-17 2HG can be measured in patient serum, and 2HG levels correlate with the presence of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations in small cohorts of patients with AML.13,18,19
PMC3682342	I02000	Despite recent insights into the distinctive pathophysiologic characteristics of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, the role of 2HG elevations within neoplastic cells has not been firmly established.
PMC3682342	I02001	Recent studies suggest that increased 2HG levels function through competitive inhibition of αKG-dependent enzymatic activities, including ten-eleven translocation 2 (TET2)–dependent DNA hydroxymethylation as well as histone demethylation, leading to dysregulated epigenetic programming.20,21 Activation of the HIF-1α pathway via inhibition of prolyl hydroxylases has also been implicated.15,22,23
PMC3682342	I03000	The prognostic significance of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations remains controversial, perhaps confounded by a differing prognosis conferred by the different allelic mutations and by different therapeutic regimens in different patient cohorts.24-27IDH2 R140 mutations appear to confer a more favorable outcome, and all isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations were associated with a favorable outcome when present in conjunction with NPM1 mutations.11,27 However, definitive information on prognostic importance is lacking.
PMC3682342	I03001	Improved scientific discernment of this pathway is important, especially given the ongoing development of targeted isocitrate dehydrogenase modulators for clinical use.28,29 Moreover, a specific role for epigenetically targeted therapies, including DNA methyltransferase inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors, may be particularly efficacious in AML subsets characterized by isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations and by mutations in other genes implicated in epigenetic regulation.30,31
PMC3682342	I04001	However, a systematic analysis of 2HG as a predictor of isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation status or to assess clinical response has not been performed.
PMC3682342	M01000	Serum was obtained from 62 E1900 patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations,11 identified by mutational analysis of coding exons with known somatic mutations using polymerase chain reaction amplification and bidirectional Sanger sequencing as described previously.13
PMC3682342	M01003	Additionally, 161 control samples, selected based on intermediate-risk cytogenetics and isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type status from the primary mutational studies,11 were analyzed.
PMC3682342	M01004	Analysts were blinded to the isocitrate dehydrogenase mutational status.
PMC3682342	M04001	The intrasample variation was most pronounced in samples with markedly elevated 2HG levels and did not affect the interpretation of the isocitrate dehydrogenase mutational status.
PMC3682342	R00002	No statistically significant differences in age, sex, or treatment group were observed between patients with and without isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, or by treating institution.
PMC3682342	R00003	Patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations had a higher platelet count (P = .002) and a higher BM blast percentage at diagnosis (P = .009), compared with patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type mutations.
PMC3682342	R00004	The presence of an isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation correlated with DNMT3A mutations (P = .022) and correlated inversely with FMS-like tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3) mutations (P < .0005) and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-α (CEPBA) mutations (P = .023).
PMC3682342	R00005	Although the incidence of TET2 mutations was low overall, no patient with an identified isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation had a co-occurring TET2 mutation, as has been reported previously.11,20
PMC3682342	R01001	In patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type AML, levels of 2HG ranged from 10 ng/mL to 14 181 ng/mL (median, 61 ng/mL).
PMC3682342	R01002	Serum 2HG levels in patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations ranged from 10 ng/mL to 30 000 ng/mL (median, 3004 ng/mL).
PMC3682342	R01003	2HG could be detected in 159 (71%) of all samples, including 60 (96.8%) of 62 samples from patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, and 99 (61.5%) of 161 samples from patients with wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase.
PMC3682342	R01004	2HG levels were significantly higher in patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, compared with patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type AML (P < .0005)
PMC3682342	R02001	We observed an association between an elevated WBC count and serum 2HG level of borderline significance (P = .057); when analyzing only isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, we identified a strong association between WBC count and elevated level of serum 2HG (P = .007) (Figure 2).
PMC3682342	R03000	Next, we evaluated serum 2HG levels in patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, based on the specific IDH1 or IDH2 mutation present (Figure 3).
PMC3682342	R03001	No significant difference in 2HG levels among patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations was identified based on the specific allelic mutation.
PMC3682342	R03002	Of note, 2HG levels in IDH2 R140 mutations did not differ significantly from the other isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations at baseline or after adjustment for WBC count, BM, or circulating blast percentage.
PMC3682342	R04000	Next, we asked whether a “threshold” level of serum 2HG level could serve as a useful screening test to segregate patients with AML with or without isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations.
PMC3682342	R04001	Using ROC analysis, we identified a strong correlation between serum 2HG level and isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations, with an area under the ROC curve between wild-type isocitrate dehydrogenase and IDH mutations of 0.918 (Figure 4), and an optimal cutoff point of 700 ng/mL. When applying this discriminatory 700-ng/mL value, we found that the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of serum 2HG level for predicting IDH mutations was 86.9% and 90.7%, respectively, with 89.6% of patients correctly classified.
PMC3682342	R05000	There were 15 isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type E1900 samples with pretreatment 2HG levels measuring >700 ng/mL. Of those, 13 samples were reanalyzed for IDH1 and IDH2 mutations using identical mutation detection methodology, at the same institution as the initial mutation analysis, with manual inspection of all traces.11 On subsequent testing, 9 of the 13 samples were discovered to have an isocitrate dehydrogenase mutation (2 samples with an IDH1 R132 mutation, 6 with an IDH2 R140Q mutation, and 1 with an IDH2 R172K mutation).
PMC3682342	R05003	Interestingly, however, 2 of these 4 samples had sequencing traces with a potential low-abundance mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase allele.
PMC3682342	R05004	For all further statistical analyses, the 9 isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type samples with identified isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations on subsequent sequencing were analyzed primarily within the IDH wild-type cohort (akin to an intention-to-treat analysis).
PMC3682342	R06003	Of note, no significant difference was found between median 2HG level in volunteers (48 ng/mL) with the median value of isocitrate dehydrogenase wild-type AML samples (61 ng/mL; or 50 ng/mL if the 9 samples with identified isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations were excluded).
PMC3682342	R07000	Sera from 29 of the E1900 patients with isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations at the time of CR (see supplemental Text for additional clinicopathologic characteristics of the remission cohort) revealed a median 2HG level of 95 ng/mL (range, 28-3149 ng/mL), compared with a median 2HG of 3234 ng/mL (range, 10-13 638 ng/mL) in these 29 patients at AML diagnosis.
PMC3682342	R08005	Because mutational analysis for isocitrate dehydrogenase at the time of CR was not performed, we cannot compare the sensitivity of serum 2HG with molecular tests for minimal residual disease (MRD).
PMC3682342	R11000	Finally, the level of serum 2HG was analyzed separately within the 3 isocitrate dehydrogenase allelic mutant cohorts and was split by the median 2HG level observed in isocitrate dehydrogenase mutations (3004 ng/mL).

Overall our findings suggest a significant role for inflammation in the pathogenesis of breast cancer and highlight the potential utility of urinary PGE-M as a biomarker of inflammation that could prove valuable in future intervention studies.

PMC3777223	M08000	In the quantitation experiments based on deconjugation, to measure diosmetin in plasma, digestion either with β-d-glucuronidase, or with sulfatase, or with both enzymes together was performed.
PMC3777223	M08001	The sample preparation protocol included in the first step an incubation of a mixture containing 100 μL plasma, 25 μL glucuronidase, 8 mg/mL (corresponding to an activity of 113.2 U); 25 μL sulfatase, 50 units/mL; 10 μL paracetamol-β-d-glucuronide, 10 μg/mL; 40 μL p-nitrocatechol sulfate, 1 mg/mL (all solutions prepared in sodium acetate 0.2 M, pH 4.5); and 200 μL sodium acetate, 0.2 M (pH 4.5), for 12 h at 37 °C, with constant mixing (Memmert).
PMC3777223	M08003	The same protocol, but without sulfatase and p-nitrocatechol, was applied to evaluate only the diosmetin originating from glucuronide metabolites; in other tests the incubation was repeated also without glucuronidase and paracetamol-β-d-glucuronide in order to measure only diosmetin originating from sulfate conjugates (in such cases d-saccharic acid 1,4-lactone monohydrate was added; 0.02 mL at a concentration of 35 mg/mL, during incubation, to inhibit any possible residual glucuronidase activity).
PMC3777223	M10001	In the case when sulfatase was used, 0.05 mL of the incubated mixture were transferred in a mictrotiter plate, treated with 0.05 mL NaOH 1 M and the obtained p-nitrocatechol was measured at 490 nm to appreciate the desulfatation process efficiency against a standard of p-nitrocatechol in water (concentration of 0.32 mMol/L, corresponding to the expected levels of p-nitrocatechol achievable in the samples with a complete enzymatic degradation).
PMC3777223	M12000	In the quantitation experiments based on deconjugation of diosmetin in urine digestions either with β-d-glucuronidase, with sulfatase, or with both enzymes together were carried out.
PMC3777223	R02001	Very important for both glucuronidase and sulfatase digestions was maintaining the pH at 5–5.5, therefore the amounts of plasma, buffer and enzyme used were studied carefully until the final protocols presented in paragraph 2.5.1.

PMC3801077	I00003	Of note, gene mutations of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 and 2 (IDH1 and IDH2) were reported recently not only in gliomas but also in AML (4, 5).
PMC3801077	I01005	Interestingly, 2-HG has been shown to competitively inhibit α-KG–dependent dioxygenases, such as the ten-eleven-translocation 2 (TET2) enzyme, and disturb the epigenetic regulatory network, leading to genome-wide histone and DNA damages with hypermethylation (12–14).
PMC3801077	I01007	2-HG can be metabolized by the enzyme 2-HG dehydrogenase (D2HGDH), but until now the possible contribution of genetic variants of this enzyme to the turnover of 2-HG has not yet been addressed.
PMC3801077	R05000	It has been established that D2HGDH and l-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (l-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase) are enzymes that convert 2-HG to α-KG.
PMC3801077	R05008	We did not find mutations in l-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase in BM cells from 10 patients with moderately high 2-HG and wild-type IDH1/2 as well as 14 cases with normal 2-HG and wild-type IDH1/2.
PMC3801077	R05009	Meanwhile, there were no significant differences in the expression levels of D2HGDH (P = 0.49) or l-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (P = 0.31) between the two above groups.
PMC3813438	D03007	In SM synthetase knockout mouse models it has been shown that the reduction of plasma membrane SMs increased insulin sensitivity [33,34].

PMC3813438	D05004	Treatment of cultured islet cells with phospholipase increased lysoPC contents and insulin secretion [46].
PMC3813438	D06006	One possible explanation for the decline of phospholipid species during the EH-clamp in TCF7L2 risk allele carriers is that the high insulin concentrations induce sphingomyelinase, down-regulate SM synthase or induce PLA2/LCAT, leading to decreasing plasma concentration of SMs, lysoPCs and PCs.

PMC3813737	D06004	Basically, phosphatidic acid is dephosphorylated by a phosphatidate phosphatase.
PMC3813737	D06005	The resulting diacylglycerol can be directly acetylated by an acyltransferase to form a triacylglycerol or can react with cytidine-diphosphate-choline (CDP-choline) or CDP-ethanolamine to form phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine, respectively.
PMC3813737	D06006	Ethanolamine phosphate cytidylyltransferase and choline phosphate cytidylyltransferase homologs were identified in trypanosomatids [45].
PMC3813737	D08005	In insects, eicosanoids are mainly synthesized from arachidonic acid released from cell membrane phospholipids via phospholipase A2 activation.
PMC3813737	D08006	Arachidonic acid is subsequently metabolized via the following three pathways: (i) the cyclooxygenase (cyclooxygenase) pathway, forming prostaglandins, thromboxanes or prostacyclins; (ii) the various lipoxygenase (lipoxygenase) pathways, forming leukotrienes, lipoxins, hepoxilins, hydro(pero)xy and hydroxy fatty acids; and (iii) the cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) pathways, forming epoxy derivatives [52].
PMC3813737	D08007	In insects, including R. prolixus, eicosanoids mediate specific cell actions, including phagocytosis, microaggregation, nodulation, hemocyte migration, hemocyte spreading and the release of prophenoloxidase in reaction to bacterial and protozoan challenges [6], [15].
PMC3813737	D08008	According to insect models [53], the chemical components of infecting microorganisms, such as lipopolysaccharide, stimulate a number of intracellular transduction systems, including those responsible for upregulation of eicosanoid biosynthesis by phospholipase A2 activation.
PMC3813737	D08012	Moreover, it has been demonstrated that T. cruzi has access to the arachidonic acid pathway through the Old Yellow Enzyme [54].
PMC3813737	D09005	The activity of extracellular folic acid is regulated by a folic acid synthase.
PMC3813737	D09007	T. cruzi is an auxotroph for folate and pteridine, which are imported through permeases.
PMC3813737	D09009	Dihydrofolate reductase (Dihydrofolate reductase) catalyzes the two-step reduction of folate to tetrahydrofolate, which is then transformed to N5, N10-methylene tetrahydrofolate and is used by thymidylate synthase (thymidylate synthase) as a methyl donor and reducing agent in the conversion of dUMP to dTMP.
PMC3813737	D10001	After salvage, pteridine precursors are reduced to their respective biologically active tetrahydro forms by the pteridine reductase PTR1.
PMC3813737	D10002	The DHFR-TS used by trypanosomatids can exclusively reduce folic acid; the reductase PTR1 shows a much broader range of activity, catalyzing successive reductions of conjugated (folate) and unconjugated (biopterin) pterins.
PMC3813737	D10004	Because of this compensatory mechanism, the development of any drug targeting the folate pathway in trypanosomatids should consider the inhibition of both Dihydrofolate reductase and PTR1 [62].

PMC3866616	M07001	DHEA-S (1000 pg) was coincubated with 1 μL of CD-FBS and 30 U of H. pomatia sulfatase or Abalone entrails sulfatase in 200 mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0 with 200 pg of [13C3]-T/-DHT at 37 °C for 24 h. DHEA-G (1000 pg) was coincubated with 40 μL of CD-FBS and 90 U of E. coli β-glucuronidase in 200mM sodium acetate, pH 5.0 with 200pg of [13C3]-T/-DHT at 37° C for 24 h.
PMC3866616	M08000	A subset of the samples was processed prior to the optimization of the glucuronidase reaction and this is the reason for the smaller ‘n’ for DHEA-G measurements compared to DHEA-S measurements in TAPS Arm 1 (Table 2).
PMC3866616	M08001	Further, androsterone glucuronide was detected in some of the samples, but at lower levels compared to DHEA-G. In future studies, a larger sampling volume of the aqueous fraction for the glucuronidase reaction will yield informative data on the levels of androsterone glucuronide.
PMC3866616	R02001	Quantitative hydrolysis was ensured using commercially available DHEA-S and DHEA-G. Digestion with recombinant E. coli β-glucuronidase was straightforward and yielded quantitative recovery for 1000pg of DHEA-G (see Table S1 in Supplemental material).
PMC3866616	R02002	However, initial results with H. pomatia extract, widely used for its sulfatase activity, resulted in total conversion of DHEA-S to unconjugated Δ4-AD.
PMC3866616	R02003	This suggested that H. pomatia extract is contaminated with 3β-HSD or cholesterol oxidase activity and could confound studies, such as ours, in which the analytes of interest are 3β-HSD substrates.
PMC3866616	R02005	However, we found that this problem could be avoided by switching to Abalone entrails sulfatase.
PMC3866616	R02006	We conducted a DHEA-S digest with the Abalone entrails sulfatase, which yielded quantitative recovery of 1000 pg DHEA-S and no conversion to Δ4-AD (Table S1).
PMC3866616	R02007	However, Abalone entrails sulfatase contains some β-glucuronidase activity, as indicated by the manufacturer.
PMC3866616	R02009	In one digest, only 1 μL of the 200 μL aqueous fraction from serum was taken for dual digest with Abalone entrails sulfatase/β-glucuronidase and E. coli β-glucuronidase.

PMC3874406	M03001	After adding 50 μL of 0.4 M ammonium acetate buffer (pH 4.0) for pH adjustment and 2000 units beta-glucuronidase (20 μL solution), samples were vortexed and incubated for 2 h at 55 °C.
PMC3874406	R08000	Considering previous reports about deconjugation of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol metabolites,28,29 we were concerned that beta-glucuronidase may not be effective for hydrolyzing ester- and ether-linked synthetic cannabinoid glucuronide metabolites.
PMC3874406	R08002	Initial experiments using commercially available JWH-018 5-hydroxypentyl glucuronide showed that incubation using 2000 units of beta glucuronidase, adjusted to pH 4 and incubated at 55 °C for two hours, achieved optimal hydrolysis.
PMC3878706	D01004	In addition, the relative presence of arginine compared with citrulline (Arg/Cit) was progressively lower in more advanced CKD stages, suggesting a lower activity of argininosuccinate synthase (Enzyme Commission [EC] number 6.3.4.5) and/or argininosuccinate lyase (EC4.3.2.1).
PMC3878706	D03002	Other mechanisms have also been observed in vivo, such as an increased activity in protein arginine methyltransferases responsible for ADMA synthesis and a reduced catabolism by dimethylargininase (EC3.5.3.18) (21).
PMC3878706	D03005	ADMA also acts on vascular function by inhibiting NO synthase.
PMC3878706	D04001	Tryptophan catabolism by indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (EC1.13.11.52) has been shown to increase with CKD severity (26,27).
PMC3878706	D04005	Additionally, CKD is expected to directly affect phenylalanine metabolism through the availability of phenylalanine 4-hydroxylase (EC1.14.16.1), a renal and hepatic enzyme responsible for converting phenylalanine into tyrosine (30).
PMC3878706	D04007	A similar pattern was expected for the renal glycine hydroxymethyltransferase (EC2.1.2.1), which converts glycine to serine; however, variations in Ser/Gly were less clear cut, and changes in plasma serine were only observable in HD patients.

PMC3886005	D01003	The postulated mechanism of serum LDL and VLDL down-regulation demonstrated in our study is the systemic activation of the inflammatory response with an increase in secretory phospholipase A2 activity that promotes hydrolysis of phospholipids in LDL and VLDL[43].
PMC3886005	D01004	Moreover, the effects of the proinflammatory cytokines like tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1 and interferon-c, which affect the expression of lipoprotein lipase that hydrolyzes triglycerides in lipoproteins, are also considered[44,45].
PMC3886005	D01006	The up-regulation of serum N-acetylated compounds that was demonstrated in the active phase of the disease could be mainly associated with α1-acid glycoprotein that is an acute-phase protein[26,48,49], while the increase in the concentration of serum phenylalanine is most likely caused by the impairment of phenylalanine-4-hydroxylase activity (a hepatic enzyme that converts phenylalanine into tyrosine) associated with immune activation and inflammation[50].

PMC4012283	D01000	Betaine (trimethylglycine) serves as an osmoregulator and is a substrate in the betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase reaction, which converts homocysteine to methionine.36
PMC4012283	D01001	In human tissues, this reaction is essential for homocysteine metabolism and methyl-donor transportation pathways, such as DNA methylation.36, 37, 38 Excess homocysteine in the brain leads to elevated oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine level, and eventually to neural toxicity and microvascular damage.39,40 Congenital homocystinuria is similarly associated with systemic illnesses such as thrombosis, osteoporosis, mental retardation and sometimes, psychotic symptoms.41,42 Betaine supplements have been used in the treatment of congenital homocystinuria and have also been shown effective in reduction of hyperhomocysteinemia in healthy individuals.37,43 The C677T polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene is a risk factor for hyperhomocysteinemia44,45 and is associated with psychiatric diseases such as bipolar disorders,38 depression38,46 and schizophrenia.38,46,47 In this study, patients with FESZ demonstrated a significantly decreased betaine concentration in both data sets (first set and second set).

PMC4144814	D05007	[39] whereas phospholipase A2 enzyme activity is low at birth and increases after weaning [40].
PMC4144814	D07000	PC can be synthesized in the body through phosphorylation of choline from the diet or via endogenous synthesis mediated by phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase in the liver [8] and mammary gland [41].
PMC4144814	D07001	These two pathways of PC synthesis result in different pools of bound fatty acids, with phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase the main origin of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, primarily DHA, in rodent and human hepatocytes [26], [29].
PMC4144814	D07002	In addition, a recent study in humans [25] found that the ratio of DHA to total fatty acids in plasma PC was a useful marker for in vivo hepatic phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity.
PMC4144814	D07003	Although we were not able to quantify total DHA in PC, due to coelution of some of the PC molecular species, the detection of DHA occurred in combination with other long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (arachidonic acid and docosapentaenoic acid) that originate primarily from the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase pathway [26], [29].
PMC4144814	D07004	We did not find a consistent pattern in the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase ratio in plasma across lactation, but a reduction in the ratio in milk from 0.009 to 0.004 was observed from early lactation to late lactation.
PMC4144814	D07005	Although the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase ratio has not been used to predict phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity in the mammary gland, our results may suggest that mammary endogenous biosynthesis of choline dropped from early to late lactation and this was consistent with increasing plasma PC concentrations as lactation progressed.
PMC4144814	D07006	Interestingly, the plasma phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase ratio in the current study was several-times lower than that reported by da Costa et al.
PMC4144814	D07008	[26] in plasma of humans and mice, suggesting PC derived from hepatic phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity may contribute a smaller proportion of total PC in the cow.
PMC4144814	D07010	[42] where they found hepatic phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase in vitro activity from sheep tissues was around one-quarter of that measured in the rat.
PMC4144814	D07011	In addition, unlike rodents and humans, where almost all phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity occurs at the liver [8], Robinson et al
PMC4144814	D07012	[42] reported that the majority of choline derived from phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity came from extrahepatic tissue in sheep, with skeletal muscle contributing around 60% of this activity.
PMC4144814	F24002	Docosahexaenoic acid in plasma phosphatidylcholine may be a potential marker for in vivo phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity in humans.
PMC4144814	I01000	Choline can be obtained from the diet [7] and from endogenous biosynthesis that predominantly occurs in the liver via the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase) pathway [8].
PMC4144814	I01001	Although the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase pathway represents an important source of choline [3], dietary intake of choline is necessary because the pathway supplies insufficient choline moiety to maintain the normal function of cells, tissues and organs
PMC4144814	I01003	In the case of the ruminant, however, dietary choline is extensively degraded (>80%) by rumen bacteria [9], [10] and therefore endogenous synthesis via the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase pathway represents a critical source of choline
PMC4144814	I04003	In addition, changes in the different PC species were of interest as recent research has shown that PC species with long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, primarily docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), originated from phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase activity in the liver of rodents and humans
PMC4144814	R04002	We also evaluated the relationship between WOL and the phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase ratio in plasma and milk.

PMC4198189	A00001	Human plasma paraoxonase-1 (PON1) and bleomycin hydrolase (bleomycin hydrolase) have been reported as the physiological HCTL detoxifying enzymes.
PMC4198189	A00002	However, the catalytic efficiency of HCTL hydrolysis by bleomycin hydrolase is low and not saturated at 20 mM HCTL.
PMC4198189	A00003	The catalytic efficiency of PON1 for HCTL hydrolysis is 100-fold lower than that of bleomycin hydrolase.
PMC4198189	A00007	We found that the catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) of rBPHL for HCTL hydrolysis was 7.7 × 104 M−1s−1, orders of magnitude higher than that of PON1 or bleomycin hydrolase, indicating a more significant physiological role for BPHL in detoxifying HCTL.
PMC4198189	D01004	Studies with yeast strains with mutations in yeast bleomycin hydrolase demonstrated increased sensitivity to HCTL [8] and studies with Blmh−/− mice also demonstrated increased sensitivity to HCTL [10].
PMC4198189	D02001	[16], then later to bleomycin hydrolase
PMC4198189	D02003	However, the data reported here strongly suggest that the previously unrecognized HCTLase activity of BPHL is likely to be physiologically more relevant than either PON1 or bleomycin hydrolase for hydrolyzing HCTL and reducing the risk of vascular and other HCTL-associated diseases.
PMC4198189	D04000	It is also useful to compare the catalytic efficiencies of HCTL hydrolysis by bleomycin hydrolase (1 × 103 M−1 s−1)
PMC4198189	D04002	Zimny and coworkers reported that the catalytic efficiency of HCTL hydrolysis by bleomycin hydrolase was ≈100-fold higher than that of PON1
PMC4198189	D04003	[8] indicating that the catalytic efficiency of HCTL hydrolysis by BPHL is almost four orders of magnitude higher than that of PON1 and nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that of bleomycin hydrolase.
PMC4198189	D05002	Interestingly, a different expression pattern was observed for bleomycin hydrolase, where low to moderate levels of expression were observed in spleen, prostate, ovary, small intestine, heart, brain, placenta and lung.
PMC4198189	D05003	Elevated levels of expression of bleomycin hydrolase mRNA were observed in testis, skeletal muscle and pancreas with very low expression levels observed in liver, kidney, colon and peripheral blood leukocytes [23].
PMC4198189	D05004	Thus, tissue expression patterns of BPHL and bleomycin hydrolase are somewhat complementary.
PMC4198189	D06004	Following purification of the liver HCTLase activity, gel electrophoretic analysis revealed several protein bands of 30–40 kDa (Figure 3A), all too small to be either PON1 or bleomycin hydrolase.
PMC4198189	D06007	BPHL differs from PON1 and bleomycin hydrolase, previously identified HCTLases, in its substrate specificity and more significantly in its high catalytic efficiency.
PMC4198189	D06008	When human liver homogenates were incubated with specific inhibitors for BPHL, bleomycin hydrolase or PON1, HCTLase activity was significantly reduced following incubation with BPHL inhibitors.
PMC4198189	D06009	This finding demonstrates that BPHL is a more relevant liver HCTLase enzyme than the two previously reported bleomycin hydrolase and PON1.
PMC4198189	D07000	It is also interesting to compare the substrate specificities of the three identified HCTL hydrolases.
PMC4198189	D07004	Many investigators cite problems of albumin interference with the Ellman assay and degradation of HCTL at alkaline pH as a rationale for using GTBL, which has been used as a lactonase substrate for analysis of PON1 activity [3], [5], [21], [22], [44].
PMC4198189	D07007	bleomycin hydrolase, an aminopeptidase, also catalyzes the hydrolysis of HCTL but not the hydrolysis of GTBL.
PMC4198189	D07008	In previous studies, typical esterase (p-nitrophenyl acetate, p-nitrophenyl butyrate) and peptidase substrates (amides such as Lys-p-nitroanilide) were tested as BPHL substrates [29].
PMC4198189	D07010	The results from this study show BPHL to be an efficient HCTLase but not a general lactonase.

PMC4198189	I03006	bleomycin hydrolase has also been associated with AD, based in part on its ability to process β-amyloid peptides [24], [25].

PMC4198189	I04002	First cloned from breast carcinoma cells, BPHL, a member of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold family, is a serine hydrolase distantly related to other members of the serine hydrolase family [26], [27].
PMC4198189	I04003	BPHL has very low activity against standard esterase substrates such as p-nitrophenyl acetate/butyrate but higher activity for hydrolysis of a number of amino ester prodrugs [29].
PMC4198189	I04006	Lai et al. reported a crystal structure of BPHL, which revealed a serine hydrolase consensus sequence of GSXSG and a catalytic triad at S122-D227-H255
PMC4198189	I05002	Both native and recombinant purified BPHLs have much higher catalytic efficiencies for HCTL hydrolysis than described for purified plasma PON1 or bleomycin hydrolase, making BPHL a much more likely candidate for protecting against HCTL toxicity under physiological conditions.
PMC4198189	R00006	The higher molecular weight band (≈44 kDa) was identified as acetyl-Coenzyme A acyltransferase 1, with a sequence coverage of 55.2%.
PMC4198189	R00007	The best match for the band at ≈34 kDa was hydroxyacyl-Coenzyme A dehydrogenase, with a 56.4% sequence coverage.
PMC4198189	R02000	To determine whether liver BPHL is more important in detoxifying HCTL than bleomycin hydrolase or PON1, we incubated human liver homogenates with specific inhibitors for BPHL, bleomycin hydrolase and PON1 and assayed the residual HCTLase activity.
PMC4198189	R02003	In contrast, bleomycin hydrolase specific inhibitor E-64, a cysteine protease inhibitor, and the two PON1 specific inhibitors EDTA and 2-hydroxyquinoline did not decrease human liver HCTLase activity.

PMC4351578	D01001	Sphingomyelins are produced from ceramides via sphingomyelinsynthase, or they can generate ceramides through hydrolysis by sphingomyelinases (Figure 5).
PMC4351578	D02000	Plasma ceramides may be generated by activated plasma sphingomyelinases (24) (Figure5) and could signal outside-in (25)and/or be further metabolized to sphingosine (by plasma ceramidases).
PMC4351578	D02001	To the extent thatplasma levels reflect cellular metabolism, the decrease in both sphingomyelins andceramides with subsequent increases in ceramide metabolites suggests that lowsphingomyelin levels are not due to a blockage in sphingomyelin synthase (which wouldresult in ceramide accumulation) but due to increased catabolism coupled with decreasedavailability of its building block precursor, ceramide (Figure 5).
PMC4351578	D03004	However, if our global metabolomicsassessment of plasma sphingolipids reflects pulmonary cellular events, worse emphysemamay be linked to increased activity of both sphingomyelinase and recycling (fromgangliosides) pathways, followed by ceramide consumption/degradation, rather thanaccumulation (Figure 5), possibly via plasmaceramidases.
PMC4351578	D03005	Because plasma S1P was not increased and tended to be negatively correlatedwith emphysema and COPD exacerbations, unlike sphingosine, it is possible that thesphingolipid metabolism is accelerated toward ceramide production and degradation butinhibited at the level of sphingosine kinase activity (Figure 5).
PMC4351578	D03009	Similarly, the role ofmonohexosylceramides in the lung is unknown, but they were shown to bind to surfactantprotein D (28) and to decrease on activation ofacid sphingomyelinase and acid β-glucosidase1, as a sign of ceramide productionvia recycling from gangliosides during inflammation (29).

PMC4369926	M04002	For the determination of total estrogens, 10 µL of internal standards working solution was spiked into a 0.1 mL aliquot of serum using a calibrated syringe, followed by the addition of 0.1 mL water, 0.1 mL 0.5% L-ascorbic acid, 0.2 mL sodium acetate buffer (200 mM, pH 5.0), and 10 µL of β-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase.
PMC4373661	A01000	Homozygosity mapping followed by whole-exome sequencing was used to identify a mutation in the gene for phosphoglucomutase 1 (PGM1) in two siblings.
PMC4373661	A01002	Phosphoglucomutase 1 enzyme activity was assayed on cell extracts.
PMC4373661	A02000	Phosphoglucomutase 1 enzyme activity was markedly diminished in all patients.
PMC4373661	A03000	Phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency, previously identified as a glycogenosis, is also a congenital disorder of glycosylation.
PMC4373661	D00000	In our study, we found that phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency, which has been shown to be a glycogen storage disorder, is also a mixed-type congenital disorder of glycosylation.
PMC4373661	D01000	Extensive use of common protein polymorphisms of phosphoglucomutase 1 in paternity testing led to the discovery of a case of reduced enzyme activity in 1963, and since then additional cases of reduced phosphoglucomutase 1 activity have been described sporadically.8,17–22 In 2009, data on an adult with exercise-induced muscle cramps and episodes of rhabdomyolysis (Patient 8 in the current study) were reported.2 Abnormal glycogen accumulation was noted in the muscles, the level of phosphoglucomutase 1 activity was only 1% of the normal level, and mutations in PGM1 were identified.
PMC4373661	D01002	However, the broad clinical and biochemical spectrum of phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency remained unrecognized.
PMC4373661	D02001	This is probably explained by the fact that other isoenzymes substitute for phosphoglucomutase 1 in the brain (see the Supplementary Appendix).
PMC4373661	D03000	We did not attempt to show experimentally the mechanisms that account for the clinical phenotypes of phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency.
PMC4373661	D03007	These characteristics are also seen with glycogen storage disease Ia, in which there is a defect in hepatic glucose-6-phosphatase.
PMC4373661	D04000	Two endocrinologic features of phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency may be directly linked to defective glycosylation.
PMC4373661	D05001	Phosphoglucomutase 1 binds to the heart-muscle-cell–specific splice variant of ZASP (Z-band alternatively spliced PDZ-motif protein), and ZASP mutations that affect the binding of phosphoglucomutase 1 are associated with dilated cardiomyopathy.26,27 Our study shows that defects in PGM1 are also associated with dilated cardiomyopathy.
PMC4373661	D06001	The extent to which this improvement in glycosylation mitigates the clinical features of phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency was not investigated systematically in our study.
PMC4373661	D06004	However, a systematic clinical study of the effects of galactose supplementation will be necessary to determine the extent to which such therapy can correct the clinical features of this condition; such studies will also incidentally help to define the pathogenesis of the individual elements of the clinical syndrome of phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency.
PMC4373661	D07000	We devised a clinical test for the diagnosis of phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency, which was based on the Beutler test for galactosemia.
PMC4373661	D07001	On initial evaluation, this modified Beutler test appeared to discriminate effectively between persons with phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency and controls.

PMC4373661	R11002	In the standard Beutler test, the activity of the GALT pathway was significantly lower in eight study patients with phosphoglucomutase 1 deficiency than in healthy newborn controls (Fig.

PMC4373661	R12000	In a modified Beutler test with the use of glucose-6-phosphate, which is dependent on the activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, there was no significant difference between study patients and controls.
PMC4373661	R12001	However, in a modified Beutler test with the use of glucose-1-phosphate, which is dependent on the activity of phosphoglucomutase 1, there was a significant reduction in enzyme activity, as assessed by means of NADPH fluorescence, in the patients (Fig.

PMC4544761	A00000	The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to investigate whether activation of the renin-angiotensin system in renovascular disease affects the cytochrome P450 ω/ω-1 hydroxylase (20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid [20-HETE]) and epoxygenase (epoxyeicosatrienoic acids [EETs]) pathways of arachidonic acid metabolism in vivo, each of which interacts with angiotensin II.
PMC4544761	A00006	Total plasma EETs were lowest, as was the ratio of plasma EETs to plasma dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids, an index of epoxide hydrolase activity, in renovascular disease (ratio: 2.4; range: 1.2 to 6.1) compared with essential hypertension (ratio: 3.4; range: 1.5 to 5.6) and control subjects (ratio: 6.8; range: 1.4 to 18.8; P<0.01).
PMC4544761	D01002	Ang II can activate the release of renal 20-HETE by stimulating the synthesis of 20-HETE at critical sites in the kidney: the preglomerular microvessels that determine renovascular resistance7,8,17,32 and a nephron segment, the medullary thick ascending limb, that contributes decisively to salt and water balance.29 The pressor response to increases in circulating Ang II can be attenuated by inhibition of 20-HETE synthesis.7 Furthermore, overexpression of an ω-hydroxylase isozyme, which increased the production of 20-HETE in blood vessels, caused endothelial dysfunction.33
PMC4544761	D02004	By way of contrast, 20-HETE, which inhibits Na+-K+-2Cl− cotransporter activity in the TAL,37 will promote Na+ reabsorption and elevate blood pressure when deficient, as in the Dahl salt-sensitive rat.38 The 4 isoforms/isozymes of ω-hydroxylase that synthesize 20-HETE29 are differentially localized in the kidney and individually regulated, eg, the 4A8 isoform is regulated by testosterone.39
PMC4544761	D02005	In addition, catalytic activities of the individual ω- and ω-1-hydroxylase isozymes vary by as much as 40-fold.29
PMC4544761	D03002	The elevated plasma concentrations of 20-HETE in RVD occurred with decreased urinary excretion of 20-HETE (Figure 1A through 1C) and probably reflects the multiple pathways for disposition of 20-HETE, namely, incorporation of 20-HETE into phospholipids, ω- and β-oxidation, and transformation of 20-HETE via cyclooxygenase into prostaglandin analogs.41,42
PMC4544761	D04000	EETs in blood are primarily acylated at the sn2 position of phospholipids and capable of being released by phospholipase A2.23 EETs are avidly incorporated into cellular phospholipids and “released at rates exceeding those for arachidonic acid.
PMC4544761	D05000	Plasma concentrations of DHETs are lowest in control subjects (Figure 2B), presumably reflecting decreased activity of soluble epoxide hydrolase contributing to the elevated plasma concentrations of EETs in control subjects (Figure 2A).
PMC4544761	D05001	Vascular-free EETs can be increased by release from endothelial phospholipids; eg, bradykinin stimulates phospholipase activity to increase unbound EETs that exert antipressor effects by relaxing vascular smooth muscle.46 On the other hand, the low levels of tissue/plasma EET concentrations in RVD may result from Ang II upregulating vascular endothelial soluble epoxide hydrolase activity.19 Diminished EET levels will augment 20-HETE vasoconstrictor activity, because 11,12-EET functions as a physiological antagonist of 20-HETE.47 Deficiency of 11,12-EET has also been linked to salt-sensitive hypertension, because 11,12-EET inhibits the epithelial sodium channel in the rat collecting duct.48 Moreover, impairment of 11,12-EET synthesis in mice produced by disruption of the gene-controlling EET synthase caused salt-sensitive hypertension.49
PMC4544761	D06005	Finally, the reduced ratio of plasma EETs: DHETs (Figure 2C) in RVD and EH subjects; vis a vis control subjects, suggests increased soluble epoxide hydrolase activity that will reduce EET levels and, thereby, decrease antipressor activity in RVD and EH (Figure 2A).

PMC4544761	I00000	In the past 2 decades, the view that the cytochrome P450 (cytochrome P450) monooxygenase pathway of arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism affects blood pressure and contributes to the development of hypertension is supported by studies in several experimental models.1,2
PMC4544761	I00001	However, little information is available on possible contributions of cytochrome P450 products to essential hypertension (EH) and human renal vascular hypertension.3
PMC4544761	I01000	cytochrome P450 monooxygenases are expressed in the renal vasculature and nephron,5 generating primarily 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) by ω- and ω-1 hydroxylases and 5,6-, 8,9-, 11,12-, and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by epoxygenases.
PMC4544761	I01002	For example, the rat 2C23 epoxygenase isozyme responds to a salt load by increasing expression and activity to augment synthesis of antipressor EETs.6 20-HETE exhibits both pressor and antipressor activities.7,8 20-HETE mediates renal circulatory autoregulation9 and contributes to pressure natriuresis.10 One or more EETs may serve as endothelial-derived hyperpolarizing factors.11,12 EETs are metabolized rapidly by epoxide hydrolases to dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), which are generally viewed as biologically inactive with a few exceptions.13 Inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (soluble epoxide hydrolase) produces increased EETs with decreased blood pressure in experimental and genetic hypertension in rats 14–16
PMC4544761	I02000	Ang II stimulates 20-HETE synthesis in renal microvessels7,17 and decreases EET levels by downregulating epoxygenases and increasing their degradation by increasing expression and activity of sEH.18,19
PMC4544761	I02001	These studies provide the rationale to the hypothesis that occasioned the present study; namely, metabolism of AA via cytochrome P450 monooxygenases is altered in renovascular disease (RVD).
PMC4544761	I02002	To assess whether altered generation of eicosanoids derived from cytochrome P450 AA metabolism occurs with activation of the renin-angiotensin system, we set up a cross-sectional study to measure 20-HETE, EET, and DHET levels in plasma and urine by paired analyses in hypertensive subjects with RVD that were compared with these levels in normotensive control subjects and those with EH.
PMC4544761	R03001	An estimation of the relative total epoxygenase activity of the 3 groups tested is available by obtaining the sum of plasma EETs+DHETs for each group, which was also significantly correlated with hypertensive status; viz, control 32.5; EH 30.4; and RVD 18 ng/mL plasma (rs=0.39; P=0.035; Figure 2C).
PMC4544761	R03004	The exception was the EH group, which exhibited plasma levels of free EETs between 0.9 and 10 ng/mL of plasma (4.7± 1.1 ng/mL of plasma, mean±SD), perhaps reflecting the reported increase in activity of plasma phospholipase A2 in hypertensive rats.27

PMC4564198	A00004	We identified and replicated 22 loci with significant associations with urinary traits, 15 of which are new (HIBCH, CPS1, AGXT, XYLB, TKT, ETNPPL, SLC6A19, DMGDH, SLC36A2, GLDC, SLC6A13, ACSM3, SLC5A11, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, SLC13A3).
PMC4564198	D08001	Interestingly, at the time when we received the first results from our association studies this gene was named AGXT2L1 and was assumed to encode an alanine-glyoxylate-aminotransferase.
PMC4564198	D08004	Meanwhile, Veiga-da-Cunha et al. experimentally investigated the locus in an independent study and found that AGXT2L1 actually encodes an ethanolaminephosphate-phospholyase [59].
PMC4564198	D08006	As ethanolamine is a direct precursor of ethanolaminephosphate via ethanolamine kinase (EC 2.7.1.28), our finding indeed matches the actual gene function.
PMC4564198	D09001	According to our evidence-based locus to gene assignment, 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase) is the most probable effector gene candidate.
PMC4564198	D09003	Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, there is no obvious, known biological link between 2-HIBA and the hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase gene or any of the remaining 8 genes covered by this locus.
PMC4564198	D09012	SETD1B is a component of the methyltransferase complex that specifically methylates the lysine-4 residue of histone H3 [67].
PMC4564198	D09015	Thus, one could speculate that in addition to its activity as a histone methylase, SETD1B may also be involved in the newly discovered process of histone hydroxyisobutyrylation, a hypothesis that may now be tested by dedicated experiments.
PMC4564198	D10002	XYLB encodes the enzyme xylulokinase [33], which catalyzes the phosphorylation of D-xylulose to D-xylulose-5-phosphate.
PMC4564198	D10003	In humans, the vast majority of D-xylulose is metabolized via xylulokinase [33, 68, 69].
PMC4564198	D10004	However, there is an alternative metabolic pathway in which D-xylulose is metabolized by phosphofructokinase (phosphofructokinase) (S3 Fig)
PMC4564198	D10007	Thus, the genetic variants in XYLB might reduce the enzymatic activity of xylulokinase and thereby cause a shift towards the alternative pathway.
PMC4564198	D11003	In case of the 14 loci with overlapping associations between blood and urine in our study (Table 3), 6 target the same metabolite in both media (CPS1, AGXT2, DMGDH, SLC6A13, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, SLC5A11).
PMC4564198	D11010	In case of the remaining 3 loci, we find no direct biochemical or metabolic relationship between the metabolites in both media, since AGXT associates with an unknown compound in blood, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase associates with amino acids in urine and HDL cholesterol in blood, and SLC6A20 targets loosely related amino acid derivatives.
PMC4564198	D12000	As an example for parallel effects in blood and urine, we identified an association between variants in the Carbamoyl-Phosphate Synthetase 1 (CPS1) gene and elevated urinary glycine levels.

PMC4564198	I01003	We identified five genetic loci (SLC6A20, AGXT2, NAT2, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, and SLC7A9) that modulate urinary metabolite levels.
PMC4564198	R04014	One of these genes is NAT8, which encodes an N-acetyltransferase.
PMC4564198	R04016	According to our evidence-based candidate genes assignment approach, the 23 loci map to the genes NAT8, HIBCH, CPS1, AGXT, XYLB, SLC6A20, TKT, ETNPPL, SLC6A19, AGXT2, DMGDH, SLC36A2, NAT2, ABO, GLDC, PYROXD2, SLC6A13, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, ACSM3, SLC5A11, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, SLC7A9, and SLC13A3.
PMC4564198	R05006	For 10 of these 19 loci (CPS1, SLC6A20, ETNPPL, SLC6A19, AGXT2, SLC36A2, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, ACSM3, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, and SLC13A3), the match between the association signal and the NMR spectrum of the candidate metabolite (as provided by the Urine Metabolome Database [54]) is strong and unique, which makes the assignment of a metabolite identity to a non-targeted trait unambiguous in these cases.
PMC4564198	R08000	For 15 of the 22 loci, no associations with urinary metabolic traits were reported so far (HIBCH, CPS1, AGXT, XYLB, TKT, ETNPPL, SLC6A19, DMGDH, SLC36A2, GLDC, SLC6A13, ACSM3, SLC5A11, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, and SLC13A3) (Fig 3, Table 3).
PMC4564198	R08001	The remaining 7 loci were already identified in our previous urine mGWAS (AGXT2, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, SLC7A9, SLC6A20, and NAT2)
PMC4564198	R09002	For 3 of these 14 loci (SLC6A20, phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase, AGXT), we consider the associated metabolic traits in both media to be unrelated.
PMC4564198	R09004	In 6 cases, the associations target the same metabolites in urine and blood (CPS1, AGXT2, DMGDH, SLC6A13, hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, SLC5A11).

PMC4581424	M06002	The normal ranges were: albumin, 35–50 g/L; total bilirubin, 3.4–20.5 mmol/L; Alanine aminotransferase, <55 U/L; Aspartate aminotransferase, 5–34 U/L; GGT, 12–64 U/L (men) and 9–36 U/L (women); and AP, 40–150 U/L. A liver function score was calculated from concentrations of albumin, total bilirubin, ALT, AST, GGT, and AP, each contributing 1 point when outside of the normal range [37].

PMC4582777	M03002	Then, the urine was spiked with sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.5, 1 M, 1 mL) containing β-glucuronidase/sulfatase (3000 unit β-glucuronidase and 100 unit sulfatase activity/mL buffer) and ascorbic acid solution (10 μL, 250 mg/mL).
PMC4582777	R03003	This method used overnight hydrolysis of urine samples (1 mL) with 10 mg enzyme (3000 unit β-glucuronidase activity and 100 unit sulfatase activity) to reach complete deconjugation of all OH-PAHs [46].

PMC4778071	D04003	This hypothesis was verified by ELISA assay, which revealed significant upregulated activity of xanthine oxidase after high altitude exposure.
PMC4778071	D04004	Thus, inhibition of xanthine oxidase by allopurinol or other xanthine oxidase inhibitors would be expected to reduce uric acid production.

PMC4794249	A00001	We hypothesised that the reportedly lower aerobic performance in non-carriers compared to carriers of the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele, i.e. ACE-DD vs. ACE-ID/ACE-II genotype, is associated with alterations in activity-induced glucose metabolism and capillarisation in exercise muscle.
PMC4794249	A02000	Cycling exercise reduced muscle glycogen concentration and this tended to be affected by the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele (p = 0.09).
PMC4794249	A03000	The observations imply a genetically modulated role for angiotensin converting enzyme in control of glucose import and oxidation in working skeletal muscle.
PMC4794249	D03000	A number of factors potentially explain the suggested difference in glucose handling between carriers and non-carriers of the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele.
PMC4794249	D03005	Support for the angiotensin converting enzyme I/D polymorphism-dependent modification of glucose metabolism in working muscle was presented by a reduced RER during the exhaustive exercise in ACE-DD genotypes (Figs ​(Figs11 and ​and2).2).
PMC4794249	D04001	None of these factors demonstrated a significant effect of the angiotensin converting enzyme I/D genotype.
PMC4794249	D05004	These findings, together with the observed indication for reduced aerobic energy metabolism in ACE-DD genotypes, are compatible with the idea that under the studied conditions the lack of the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele is associated with a reduced oxidative carbon flux in exercised muscle resulting from an imbalance between anaplerosis and cataplerosis.
PMC4794249	D06000	The identified differences in serum glucose concentration between angiotensin converting enzyme genotypes after the lab test were remarkably well confirmed by the pronounced rise in serum glucose after the field test.
PMC4794249	D06004	Thus, our findings are indicative of a reduction in glucose oxidation in non-carriers of the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele with one-legged exercise [21].
PMC4794249	D06005	Because skeletal muscle is a main contributor to energy utilisation with exercise [41], our finding suggests that the elevated serum concentration of glucose in non-carriers of the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele reflects a relatively reduced oxidation of glucose in contracting muscle.
PMC4794249	D06008	Overall the present novel findings lead us to the interpretation that the lack of an angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele, in the studied subjects, is a disadvantageous condition for aerobic energy metabolism during and after endurance work which is compensated by a shift in energy production to metabolic alternatives of glucose oxidation.
PMC4794249	D09004	These latter observations are of interest given that the enzyme activity of angiotensin converting enzyme is regulated by shear stress acting on the endothelial lumen such a during exercise induced hyperemia [47] and because angiotensin 2 which increases in function of exercise intensity [10] affects arterio-venous glucose extraction and glucose utilisation in contracting muscle [21,48].
PMC4794249	D09005	In our study serum angiotensin 2 concentrations were higher in ACE-DD genotypes at rest as predicted based on the effect of the presence of the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele on the expression of angiotensin converting enzyme and the downstream processing of angiotensin 2
PMC4794249	D09008	We have recently identified that variability in the rise in serum angiotensin 2 after intense exercise and capillary perfusion is related to the angiotensin converting enzyme I/D polymorphism [10].
PMC4794249	D09011	Our findings imply that genetic effects of the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele on serum angiotensin 2 levels modulate the former association.

PMC4794249	I01002	Intriguingly, a distinct gene polymorphism, i.e. ACE-I/D, for the upstream regulator of angiotensin 2, angiotensin converting enzyme (angiotensin converting enzyme), is associated with endurance performance through the regulation of angiotensin converting enzyme activity [13,14].
PMC4794249	I01003	The ACE-I/D polymorphism is characterised by either the presence (I-allele) or the absence (D-allele) of a silencer sequence in intron 16 of the angiotensin converting enzyme gene [15].
PMC4794249	I01004	Presence of the I-allele thus results in lower angiotensin converting enzyme activity in blood serum and in reduced expression of the angiotensin converting enzyme gene transcript and of the ACE protein in skeletal muscle, potentially reducing the capacity for angiotensin 2 production [14,16].
PMC4794249	I01007	Peripheral components possibly also contribute to the superior endurance performance in subjects with the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele.
PMC4794249	I01008	This is indicated by our recent observation of elevated capillarisation in subjects with the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele and superior increases in the local components of aerobic substrate metabolism with endurance training, i.e. the volume density of subsarcolemmal mitochondria and intramyocellular lipids [16].
PMC4794249	I01010	Collectively, the findings highlight an important role of the angiotensin converting enzyme system in the regulation of glucose metabolism in muscle with exercise.
PMC4794249	I02000	The significance of phenotypic variation due to the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele on the acute angiotensin 2-related response of muscle metabolism to endurance exercise is yet to be established.
PMC4794249	I02001	We reasoned that differences in metabolic reactions in working muscle should exist between carriers and non-carriers of the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele and would relate to a modulated muscle capillarisation and exercise response of angiotensin 2 levels in serum.
PMC4794249	R01002	The serum concentration of glucose, but not triglyceride, lipoprotein and ketone concentration was increased in ACE-DD genotypes after the exercise and this differed to the response of subjects with the angiotensin converting enzyme I-allele (S1 Table, Fig 1A).
PMC4794249	R02000	Serum concentration of the angiotensin converting enzyme product, angiotensin 2, was higher in ACE-DD genotypes than in ACE-II and ID genotypes before (29.0 ± 3.1 vs. 6.5 ± 2.2 pg/ml, p = 0.01), but not after (24.2 ± 3.1 vs. 28.2 ± 18.8 pg/ml, p = 0.45), the one-legged cycling exercise.

PMC4833348	I01002	Serum elevations of creatine kinase are generally considered a diagnostic biomarker of DMD, even in presymptomatic infants [11].
PMC4833348	I01003	However, the large inter- and intra-person variability in creatine kinase levels, partly caused by the impact of the child’s age and sensitivity to physical activity, makes it a poor candidate for use as a surrogate biomarker.
PMC4833348	I01004	Furthermore, creatine kinase levels have been shown to be inversely correlated with disease progression and severity due to the loss of muscle tissue for more advanced patients, which causes less creatine kinase to leak into the blood stream and be detected [12].

PMC5031239	A00010	Conclusions: Although increased lipogenesis, desaturases, and lipoxygenase activities characterize NAFL and NASH, impaired peroxisomal polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) metabolism and nonenzymatic oxidation is associated with progression to NASH.
PMC5031239	D01001	Specifically, the increments in palmitoleic acid (16:1 n7) and its downstream product vaccenic acid (18:1 n7) suggest increased activity of the Δ 9 stearoyl-CoA desaturase (Figs. 1 and ​and2C),2C), a sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c target.25–27 This is further corroborated by the significant increase in palmitoleic acid (16:1n7): palmitic acid (16:0), and oleic acid (18:1n9):stearic acid (18:0) ratios in NAFL and NASH along with unchanged or decreased levels of downstream metabolites (arichidenic [20:0], behenic [22:0], and lignoceric [24:0] acids) along the long chain fatty acid elongase pathway (Fig. 2C).
PMC5031239	D03002	Mead acid (20:3 n9) is derived from oleic acid (18:1n9) by the actions of Δ6 desaturase, which usually uses linoleic acid (18:2 n6) or α-linolenic acid (18:3 n3) as its natural substrate.30 Moreover, dietary essential fatty acid deficiency is rare in the Western world.
PMC5031239	D03003	We therefore interpret these data to indicate increased utilization of the essential fatty acids by Δ6 desaturase as evidenced by increased levels of its downstream metabolites (Fig.
PMC5031239	D05000	Another novel finding of potential pathophysiological importance is evidence of systemic lipoxygenase rather than cyclooxygenase activation in this study.
PMC5031239	D05001	Although the products of cyclooxygenase activation were not significantly altered, there was an increase in products of 5-LOX, 8-LOX, and 15-LOX that were maximal in subjects with NASH.
PMC5031239	D07000	Taken together, these data indicate that the development of NAFL is accompanied by increased lipogenesis, Δ9 desaturase, and lipoxygenase activity (Fig. 6).
PMC5031239	D07001	With progression to NASH, the lipogenic activity levels off or declines modestly, whereas the lipoxygenase activity increases.

PMC5031239	R00002	Compared with lean normal controls, subjects with NAFL and NASH had higher aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels, lower high-density lipoprotein, higher low-density lipoprotein, and higher triglycerides.
PMC5031239	R04002	There was also a significant decrease in stearic acid (18:0) levels and a concomitant increase in its downstream product oleic (18:1 n9) in the Δ9 steroyl CoA desaturase (stearoyl-CoA desaturase) pathway, within DAG in both NAFL and NASH.
PMC5031239	R06000	The palmitoleic acid (16:1 n7) to palmitic acid (16:0) ratio, reflective of Δ 9 stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity,21 was increased in NAFL and NASH across multiple lipid classes (Fig.
PMC5031239	R06002	Delta 9 stearoyl-CoA desaturase also catalyzes the conversion of stearic acid (18:0) to oleic acid (18:1 n9).
PMC5031239	R06003	When the data were integrated across all lipid classes (Fig. 2B, C), there was also a significant increase in oleic acid (18:1 n9) levels, further supporting increased Δ 9 stearoyl-CoA desaturase activity.
PMC5031239	R06004	Simultaneously, the downstream products of stearic acid (18:0) along the long chain elongase pathway were decreased (NAFL) or unchanged (NASH), suggesting greater movement of stearate along the Δ 9 stearoyl-CoA desaturase rather than the elongase pathway.
PMC5031239	R08001	Gamma-linolenic (18:3n6) and dihomo γ-linolenic (20:3n6) acids, the downstream metabolites of linoleic acid (18:2n6), were considerably increased (P < 0.001 for most lipid classes) in subjects with both NAFL and NASH, suggestive of increased Δ 6 desaturase (Δ6DS) activity (Fig.
PMC5031239	R11000	The levels of cycloxygenase (cyclooxygenase) and lipoxygenase (lipoxygenase) products of AA (20:4 n6) in circulation were measured next.
PMC5031239	R11001	The plasma levels of cyclooxygenase products of AA (prostaglandin [PG]-M, PGB2, PGD2, PGE2, PGF2α, and thromboxane A2) were not significantly different across the three study groups.
PMC5031239	R11002	In sharp contrast, many of the products of the lipoxygenase pathway were significantly higher in NASH patients in comparison with the NAFL or normal group (Fig.
PMC5037848	D04001	Possible explanations for this effect include differences in the diet of smokers as well as more direct causal effects of smoking, such as the inhibition of lipoprotein lipase by nicotine, which could result in reduced lipid clearance [39,40].

PMC5037848	D15002	For subjects who used statins to reduce cholesterol levels via inhibition of HMCoA-reductase (the majority of the study population), this effect could be related to the enhancing effects of statins on the conversion of linoleic acid to its PUFA derivatives [76,77].

PMC5047709	A02001	Tryptophan was decreased at day 0 of AECOPD compared to controls corresponding to an increase in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity.
PMC5047709	A03000	Patients with AECOPD have a unique metabolomic signature that includes a decrease in tryptophan levels consistent with an increase in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity.
PMC5047709	D01003	This decrease in tryptophan is consistent with an increased catabolism through the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase pathway as demonstrated by an increase in Kyn/Trp.
PMC5047709	D01004	After 30 days of recovery from an AECOPD, tryptophan levels remained significantly lower compared to control subjects; however, indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity was no longer increased at that time.
PMC5047709	D02002	Recent studies have also implicated tryptophan catabolism through the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase pathway as having antimicrobial effects.
PMC5047709	D02003	The list of pathogens sensitive to tryptophan catabolism via indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase includes respiratory pathogens common in AECOPD such as Streptococci.12 A decrease in serum tryptophan levels has been reported in pulmonary infections and predicts prognosis in both tuberculosis and community-acquired pneumonia.13,14 Since AECOPD is often due to respiratory tract infections, it is a possibility that tryptophan catabolism in that setting is actually a biomarker for infection.
PMC5047709	D03002	Most of the effects of tryptophan catabolism come from accumulation of its active metabolites, such as kynurenine, rather than tryptophan depletion.15,16 The generation of kynurenine through indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activation leads to immune tolerance and an anti-inflammatory effect through the proliferation of Treg FoxP3 cells and suppression of Th17 cells.16,17
PMC5047709	D03003	The immune tolerance effect of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activation has been implicated in lung cancer and HIV infection.18–22 Thus, tryptophan depletion and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activation have both antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects.12
PMC5047709	D04000	Although decreases in tryptophan and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activation have been reported in lung cancer and certain lung infections, little is known of its role in COPD.
PMC5047709	D04002	Ubhi et al24 measured amino acid metabolism using mass spectrometry in COPD patients from the ECLIPSE cohort and found tryptophan levels were decreased in the serum of COPD patients with emphysema.24 However, they did not assess indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity.
PMC5047709	D04003	However, Maneechotesuwan et al25 found indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity decreased in the sputum of COPD patients that correlated with severity of disease and a reversal between the IL-10 and IL-17A balance.
PMC5047709	D04004	This suggests that a decrease in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity within sputum creates an environment supporting neutrophilic inflammation.25 In our study, we found tryptophan levels to be decreased in the plasma of patients with an AECOPD consistent with an activation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, as measured by kynurenine and tryptophan ratios.
PMC5047709	D04005	This increase in indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity was still present at day 30, but to a lesser extent.

PMC5047709	R02003	indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase is the main inducible and rate-limiting enzyme involved in tryptophan catabolism, with kynurenine as the main metabolite of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase pathway.

PMC5243144	A00000	We recently showed that the anaplerotic enzyme pyruvate carboxylase (pyruvate carboxylase) is up-regulated in human breast cancer tissue and its expression is correlated with the late stages of breast cancer and tumor size [Phannasil et al., PloS
PMC5243144	A00002	In the current study we showed that pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity is much higher in the highly invasive breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 than in less invasive breast cancer cell lines.
PMC5243144	A00003	We generated multiple stable pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cell lines from the MDA-MB-231 cell line and used mass spectrometry with 13C6-glucose and 13C5-glutamine to discern the pathways that use pyruvate carboxylase in support of cell growth.
PMC5243144	A00004	Cells with severe pyruvate carboxylase knockdown showed a marked reduction in viability and proliferation rates suggesting the perturbation of pathways that are involved in cancer invasiveness.
PMC5243144	A00005	Strong pyruvate carboxylase suppression lowered glucose incorporation into downstream metabolites of oxaloacetate, the product of the pyruvate carboxylase reaction, including malate, citrate and aspartate.
PMC5243144	A00008	ATP, ADP and NAD(H) levels were unchanged indicating that pyruvate carboxylase suppression did not significantly affect mitochondrial energy production.
PMC5243144	A00009	The data indicate that the major metabolic roles of pyruvate carboxylase in invasive breast cancer are primarily anaplerosis, pyruvate cycling and mitochondrial biosynthesis of precursors of cellular components required for breast cancer cell growth and replication.
PMC5243144	D00002	We and others have shown that pyruvate carboxylase mRNA and pyruvate carboxylase protein are up-regulated in many cancers [7–10].
PMC5243144	D01000	In the current study we generated multiple stable pyruvate carboxylase knockdown MDA-MB-231-derived cell lines by shRNA with various levels of pyruvate carboxylase knockdown and investigated the biochemical changes associated with the defects in growth and motility phenotypic defects of the PC knockdown cells.
PMC5243144	D01001	The various degrees of decreases in pyruvate carboxylase mRNA and pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity were correlated with the decreased cell proliferation rates among the cell lines (Fig. 2).
PMC5243144	D01002	This is a confirmation of the relationship between pyruvate carboxylase enzyme levels and proliferation rates in breast cancer cells.
PMC5243144	D01003	This retarded proliferation phenotype of the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown MDA-MB-231 cell lines was also similar to that of the transient knockdown of pyruvate carboxylase in the MDA-MB-231 cell line that we reported previously [10].
PMC5243144	D01004	A dose-dependent suppression effect on metabolism and inhibition of insulin secretion were also observed in the rat insulinoma cell line INS-1 832/13 with different degrees of pyruvate carboxylase suppression [12].
PMC5243144	D01005	A similar disturbance of common metabolites was observed in both moderate and strong pyruvate carboxylase suppression MDA-MB-231-derived cells as shown in Table 3 and Figs. 5 and ​and66.
PMC5243144	D02000	The central metabolic pathway affected by the suppression of pyruvate carboxylase appears to lie within the anaplerosis.
PMC5243144	D02001	The product of the pyruvate carboxylase reaction is oxaloacetate, which immediately condenses with acetyl-CoA to produce citrate or is converted to malate in the mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase reaction.
PMC5243144	D02002	Suppression of pyruvate carboxylase resulted in the depletions of malate and citrate levels as expected (Figs. 5 and ​and6).6).
PMC5243144	D02003	Suppression of pyruvate carboxylase decreased the levels of total citrate and malate and 13C incorporation into their isotopomers from 13C6-labeled glucose and 13C5-labeled glutamine (Fig. 5).
PMC5243144	D02004	This indicates that pyruvate carboxylase knockdown inhibits anaplerosis from both pyruvate carboxylation and glutaminolysis.
PMC5243144	D03000	In contrast to suppression of pyruvate carboxylase expression in pancreatic beta cells, in which the knockdown cells showed a metabolic crossover point with increased levels of pyruvate and low levels of malate and citrate [12], suppression of pyruvate carboxylase in MDA-MB-231 cell lines showed lowered levels of pyruvate and lactate when cells were maintained in the presence of a high concentration of glucose (25 mM) (in DMEM cell culture medium) prior to the experiment (Fig. 7).
PMC5243144	D03001	Similar to experiments with pancreatic beta cells [12], when the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cells were maintained in a cell culture medium containing a lower and physiologic concentration of glucose (5 mM) before glucose was added as in the experiments with beta cells, pyruvate was increased and malate and citrate were decreased indicating a crossover point and a block at the pyruvate carboxylase reaction (Fig. 6).
PMC5243144	D03004	In the pyruvate-malate shuttle pyruvate carboxylase converts pyruvate to oxaloacetate followed by the conversion of oxaloacetate to malate by mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, enabling malate to exit mitochondria.
PMC5243144	D03005	In the cytosol malate is in turn converted back to pyruvate by cytosolic malic enzyme, allowing pyruvate to re-enter mitochondria for carboxylation again by pyruvate carboxylase (Fig. 4).
PMC5243144	D03006	In the citrate-pyruvate shuttle citrate is exported from the mitochondria and cleaved to oxaloacetate in the ATP citrate lyase reaction.
PMC5243144	D03007	The oxaloacetate is then reduced to malate catalyzed by cytosolic malate dehydrogenase.
PMC5243144	D03011	In addition, the acetyl-CoA derived from the ATP citrate lyase reaction can be converted to malonyl-CoA and utilized for lipid synthesis in the cytosol.
PMC5243144	D03012	The higher levels of pyruvate carboxylase mRNA and pyruvate carboxylase protein [10] and PC enzyme activity (Table 2) in the highly metastatic MDA-MB-231 cell line than in the low metastatic MCF-7 cell line suggest that similar to pyruvate cycling operative in pancreatic beta cells, pyruvate cycling is important for cell invasiveness or metastasis in breast cancer.
PMC5243144	D03013	In the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells, the depleted levels of malate and citrate caused by the chronic suppression of pyruvate carboxylase may slow down the overall pyruvate cycling rate, resulting in the low level of pyruvate (Fig. 7).
PMC5243144	D04000	Interestingly, the level of cytosolic malic enzyme was 50% lower in two of the three cell lines with severe knockdown of pyruvate carboxylase studied.
PMC5243144	D04001	The shRNA nucleotide sequence used to target the pyruvate carboxylase mRNA was not similar to any of the nucleotide sequence of the malic enzyme mRNA indicating the lower level of the malic enzyme was not due to an off target effect of pyruvate carboxylase targeting.
PMC5243144	D05001	8) and lower glucose carbon incorporation into palmitate (Fig. 9) are consistent with the anaplerotic/cataplerotic role of pyruvate carboxylase in growth of breast cancer cells.
PMC5243144	D06000	Transamination of oxaloacetate with glutamate catalyzed by aspartate aminotransferase would produce aspartate.
PMC5243144	D06001	Therefore, it is likely that the lowered level of oxaloacetate caused by suppression of pyruvate carboxylase may be responsible for the low level of aspartate (Fig.
PMC5243144	D06003	A lowered level of aspartate was also reported in the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which showed a marked decrease in the cellular aspartate level [9].
PMC5243144	D06004	In renal adenocarcinoma and paraganglioma cancers harboring loss of function mutations of succinate dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase was found essential to support cancer proliferation [22,23].
PMC5243144	D06005	Suppression of pyruvate carboxylase slows down proliferation of these cancers, concomitant with reduced cellular levels of aspartate.
PMC5243144	D06008	10 and Table 3) and as-partate observed in the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells can potentially slow the synthesis of these nucleotides, contributing to the low rates of cell proliferation.
PMC5243144	D06010	Similar to our study, the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) also showed reduction of glucose- and glutamine- derived CTP and UTP levels [9].
PMC5243144	D07000	The marked reduction of serine and glycine levels in the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cells may underlie the retarded growth phenotype of the knockdown cells because serine contributes to various biosynthetic pathways including protein synthesis, phospholipids and nucleotides which are in high demand during tumorigenesis [24].
PMC5243144	D08002	The first reaction is the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate by phosphoglycerate dehydro genase followed by further conversion to 3-phosphoserine by phosphoserine aminotransferase before the final conversion to serine by protein serine phosphatase.
PMC5243144	D08003	Then phosphoserine aminotransferase catalyzes the transfer of the amino group from glutamate to 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate.
PMC5243144	D08004	Because glutamate is produced from α-ketoglutarate via a transamination reaction, the lowered level of α-ketoglutarate in the PC-knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells (Fig. 10) may in turn lower the rate of glutamate formation which consequently affects the transamination reaction catalyzed by phosphoserine aminotransferase.
PMC5243144	D08005	Interestingly, up-regulation of serine and glycine biosynthesis caused by amplification of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase gene copy number was also reported to contribute to oncogenesis in melanoma and breast cancer [24,25].
PMC5243144	D08006	Suppression of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase expression in several breast cancer cell lines including MDA-MB-231 cells, lowered serine biosynthesis concomitant with a decreased cell proliferation rate, indicating the crucial role of serine in supporting breast cancer growth.
PMC5243144	D08007	Suppression of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase expression in invasive breast cancer cells also reduces the level of α-ketoglutarate which is produced from the transamination of glutamate [26].
PMC5243144	D08008	These findings mirror the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown MDA-MB-231 cells that showed lowered levels of α-ketoglutarate and serine in the current study.
PMC5243144	D09000	Lowered levels of total cellular acetyl-CoA in the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cell lines can most likely be attributed to decreased export of citrate from mitochondria causing decreased citrate available for conversation to oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA catalyzed by ATP citrate lyase in the cytosol.
PMC5243144	D10000	In addition to the lowered levels of certain mitochondrial metabolites, pyruvate cycling and nucleotide synthesis, we also found that suppression of pyruvate carboxylase causes a reduction of glucose incorporation into palmitate (Fig. 9), suggesting that inhibition of anaplerosis caused by pyruvate carboxylase knockdown results in lower fatty acid synthesis which restricts membrane biogenesis of the newly dividing cells.
PMC5243144	D11000	Suppression of pyruvate carboxylase only slightly and insignificantly lowered the concentrations of ATP and ADP without affecting the ATP/ADP ratio and NAD(P)(H) concentrations (Fig. 11) indicating suppression of pyruvate carboxylase did not seriously affect the cell energy charge.
PMC5243144	D12000	Since we studied the MDA-MB-231 cell line which is triple negative for estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)in our study, one might argue whether overexpression of pyruvate carboxylase is a specific characteristic of breast cancer cell lines.
PMC5243144	D12001	Using various other breast cancer cell lines expressing these three receptors differently, we found no correlation between the expression of these receptors and pyruvate carboxylase expression.
PMC5243144	D12002	For example, the two most invasive breast cancer cell lines, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435, which are ER−/PR−/HER2− and ER−/PR2−/HER2+, respectively, express pyruvate carboxylase much higher than MCF-7 and SKBR3 cell lines, which are ER+/PR+/HER2− and ER−/PR−/HER2+, respectively (10).
PMC5243144	D12003	Furthermore, unlike MDA-MB-231, MCF-10A, a non-invasive cell line that is also negative for those three receptors was found to possess an extremely low level of pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity (data not shown).
PMC5243144	D12004	Most importantly, our clinicopathological investigation of breast cancer patients has also shown that the level of pyruvate carboxylase expression was not correlated with the status of these receptors in breast cancer tissues of patients but rather shows a positive correlation with tumor size and stages (10).
PMC5243144	D12005	Thus the level of expression of pyruvate carboxylase appears to be independent of the status of ER, PR and HER2 receptor expression.

PMC5243144	I00008	A major anaplerotic reaction involves the carboxylation of pyruvate to oxaloacetate catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase (pyruvate carboxylase) followed by oxaloacetate’s conversion to malate, citrate and aspartate and their export from mitochondria to the cytosol where they become precursors for the synthesis of carbohydrates, lipids and amino acids [5].
PMC5243144	I00009	Glutaminolysis involves the conversion of glutamine to glutamate by glutaminase followed by oxidative deamination of glutamate to α-ketoglutarate catalyzed by glutamate dehydrogenase.
PMC5243144	I01000	We recently showed that pyruvate carboxylase is up-regulated in human breast cancer tissue and its expression levels correlated with the late stages of breast cancer and tumor size but not with the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) in patients’ breast tissues [10].
PMC5243144	I01001	In supporting these clinical data, we also found that the levels of pyruvate carboxylase and its mRNA were not correlated with expression of these three receptors in four independent breast cancer cell lines, namely MDA-MB-231 (ER−/PR−/HER2−), MDA-MB-435 (ER−/PR−/HER2+), MCF-7 (ER+/PR+/HER2−) and SKRB3 (ER−/ PR−/HER2+)
PMC5243144	I01004	Ectopic expression of pyruvate carboxylase in MCF-7 cells increases their proliferation, motility and invasion abilities, suggesting a further link between pyruvate carboxylase and aggressive phenotype of breast cancer.
PMC5243144	I01005	Transient suppression of pyruvate carboxylase expression in MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cell lines reduced their proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro indicating the essential role of pyruvate carboxylase in supporting breast cancer growth and invasiveness [10].
PMC5243144	I02000	It remains unclear which biochemical pathways and metabolites are altered by pyruvate carboxylase knockdown and contribute to the slow proliferation and decreased motility phenotypes in breast cancer.
PMC5243144	I02001	In the current study we generated multiple stable pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cell lines from the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line, a highly invasive cell line with a high pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity.
PMC5243144	I02002	The cell lines with severe pyruvate carboxylase knockdown showed marked decreases in cell viability and proliferation rates.
PMC5243144	I02003	pyruvate carboxylase knockdown caused decreases in malate, citrate and pyruvate levels and glucose incorporation into these metabolites suggesting the inhibition of mitochondrial pyruvate cycling, decreases in aspartate and other amino acids, some nucleotides and their derivatives needed for cell structure, as well as decreased incorporation of glucose carbon into palmitate.
PMC5243144	I02004	ATP, ADP and pyridine nucleotide levels were not significantly affected demonstrating that pyruvate carboxylase knockdown does not inhibit mitochondrial energy production.
PMC5243144	I02005	The results demonstrate the important role of pyruvate carboxylase in anaplerosis and pyruvate cycling via mitochondrial biosynthesis for growth and survival of the MDA-MB-231 cells.
PMC5243144	R00000	The pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity of the MDA-MB-231 cell line, which is a highly invasive breast cancer cell line, was 10-fold higher than the pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity of the less invasive breast cancer cell line MCF-7 (Table 2).
PMC5243144	R00001	Six shRNA constructs (PC179, PC847, PC2054, PC2096, PC2653 and PC3436) targeted to human pyruvate carboxylase mRNA were transfected to MDA-MB-231 cells.
PMC5243144	R00002	The stable cell lines were named according to the first nucleotide of the pyruvate carboxylase mRNA sequence targeted.
PMC5243144	R00004	1A and B show that the degree of knockdown of pyruvate carboxylase mRNA correlated fairly well with the degree of knockdown of pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity and PC protein in the various PC targeted cell lines.
PMC5243144	R00005	As we have previously observed, knockdown of pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity and pyruvate carboxylase protein, although correlated well with the degree of mRNA knockdown was in general slightly less than the knockdown of PC mRNA
PMC5243144	R00007	Cell line pyruvate carboxylase 2096 4B possessed a pyruvate carboxylase mRNA level of approximately 10% compared to the scrambled shRNA control cell line, while cell lines PC 179 1A, PC 847 2C, PC 2054 3D, PC 3436 6A and PC 3436
PMC5243144	R00008	6C contained pyruvate carboxylase mRNA levels of 20–40% that of the scrambled shRNA control cell line.
PMC5243144	R00009	Only modest reductions (50– 70%) of pyruvate carboxylase mRNA level were observed in cell lines pyruvate carboxylase 179 1B, PC 2054
PMC5243144	R00010	3A and pyruvate carboxylase 2096 4C, while the level of pyruvate carboxylase mRNA was not decreased in cell lines PC 2653 5A and PC 2653 5B. PC enzyme activity of these cell lines was proportional to the levels of PC mRNA, with PC enzyme activity being lowest (5%) in the PC 2096 4B cell line (Fig. 1B).
PMC5243144	R00011	Cell lines pyruvate carboxylase 2096 4B, pyruvate carboxylase

PMC5243144	R00013	5B showed the highest, modest and lowest pyruvate carboxylase knockdown levels, respectively.
PMC5243144	R01000	Cell lines with lower pyruvate carboxylase mRNA and enzyme activity showed lower cell viability (Fig.
PMC5243144	R01002	We selected two cell lines, pyruvate carboxylase 847 2C and pyruvate carboxylase 2096 4B, for further analysis of cell growth.
PMC5243144	R01003	Both knockdown cell lines showed decreased cell numbers at day 4, that became more obvious at days 5–7, with the pyruvate carboxylase 847
PMC5243144	R01004	2C cell line showing a 35% lower cell count vs. the scrambled shRNA control cell line at day 7 and the pyruvate carboxylase 2096 B cell line showing a 65% lower cell count vs. the control cell line at day 7 (Fig. 2C).
PMC5243144	R02001	This allowed us to distinguish which of the fluxes of the carbon sources might be more impaired in the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cell lines pyruvate carboxylase 847 2C and PC 2096 4B compared to the shRNA scramble control MDA-MB-231 cell line.
PMC5243144	R02005	For the experiment to look for a crossover point in the levels of the metabolites around the pyruvate carboxylase reaction, the cells were incubated in the presence of 5 mM glucose in RPMI 1640 cell culture medium because the high concentration of glucose in the DMEM medium would produce high levels of metabolites possibly obscuring a crossover point in the levels of the metabolites.
PMC5243144	R03000	As expected, because pyruvate carboxylase is a mitochondrial enzyme its suppression did not affect the levels of glycolytic intermediates as glucose-6-phosphate, fructose-6-phosphate and fructose bisphosphate were not altered in each of these pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cell lines (Fig.
PMC5243144	R04000	The immediate product of the pyruvate carboxylase reaction is oxaloacetate which is then directly converted to malate and citrate (Fig. 4).
PMC5243144	R04005	Strong suppression of pyruvate carboxylase expression (cell line pyruvate carboxylase 2096 4B) markedly decreased the levels of both citrate and malate and decreased the incorporation of carbon from glucose and glutamine into citrate and malate (Fig. 5).
PMC5243144	R04006	Citrate was mainly +2 labeled with 13C6-glucose, suggesting that pyruvate de-hydrogenase supplied acetyl-CoA that was incorporated into citrate in the citrate synthase reaction.
PMC5243144	R04008	This indicates that the +3 labeled malate came from oxaloacetate formed in the pyruvate carboxylase reaction and the +2 labeled malate came from the citric acid cycle after the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction produced +2 labeled acetyl-CoA that was incorporated into citrate that then became +2 labeled malate after flux through the citrate-pyruvate cycle or through the citric acid cycle.
PMC5243144	R04009	13C5 labeled glutamine produced mostly +4 labeled citrate and malate that entered mitochondrial metabolism through α-ketoglutarate derived from glutamate in the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction.
PMC5243144	R04010	The decreased 13C incorporation into malate and citrate from glucose and glutamine in the pyruvate carboxylase 2096 4B cell line can be explained by pyruvate carboxylase knockdown inhibiting pyruvate flux through the citrate-pyruvate and the malate-pyruvate cycles.
PMC5243144	R05001	Similarly to the mass spectrometry measurements of malate and citrate in the cell lines maintained in DMEM cell culture medium the cell lines with knocked down pyruvate carboxylase maintained in the modified RPMI 1640 medium followed by the Krebs Ringer solution, the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cell lines PC 847 2C, PC
PMC5243144	R05002	2096 4B and pyruvate carboxylase 179 1A, showed decreased levels of malate and citrate compared to the control cell line containing a scrambled shRNA (Fig. 6).
PMC5243144	R06002	Suppression of pyruvate carboxylase caused a marked reduction in the level of glucose-derived pyruvate in the mass spectrometry experiments in which the cells were cultured in DMEM for four or more days prior to the experiment (see Fig.
PMC5243144	R06004	Since pyruvate is the substrate for the pyruvate carboxylase reaction, it might be expected that suppression of pyruvate carboxylase expression would result in the accumulation of pyruvate, which is the substrate of PC, as we previously observed in pancreatic beta cells with knocked down PC [12].
PMC5243144	R06005	The lower levels of pyruvate seen in the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cell lines were likely due to decreased malate and citrate cycling to pyruvate because the levels of these two metabolites were markedly decreased by pyruvate carboxylase knockdown (Fig. 5).
PMC5243144	R06007	Pyruvate can then re-enter mitochondria and be reconverted to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase (the pyruvate-malate shuttle)
PMC5243144	R06009	Alternatively in the pyruvate-citrate shuttle, citrate can exit mitochondria and be converted to oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA by ATP-citrate lyase [18,19].
PMC5243144	R06010	Oxaloacetate can then be converted to malate by cytosolic malate dehydrogenase.
PMC5243144	R06012	The malate-pyruvate and citrate-pyruvate cycles are very active in pancreatic beta cells where pyruvate carboxylase protein and enzyme activity are high and support these cycles [17,18].
PMC5243144	R06014	Because glycolysis was not inhibited (Fig. 3), the decreased 13C6-glucose incorporation into pyruvate and lac-tate in the two pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cell lines (Fig.
PMC5243144	R06015	7A and B) can only be explained by a decreased activity of pyruvate cycling due to decreased pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity.
PMC5243144	R07003	Because the concentration of glucose was so high in the DMEM medium, it was expected that this could cause a higher level of pyruvate in both the control and pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cell lines making it difficult to see a crossover point with an expected even higher level of pyruvate in the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cell lines.
PMC5243144	R07006	Similarly to experiments in which pure beta cells with knocked down pyruvate carboxylase were maintained at a physiological concentration of glucose prior to a 35 min incubation with 10 mM glucose, an increase in pyruvate was observed along with the decreases in malate and citrate in all three pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cell lines shown in Fig.
PMC5243144	R07008	This crossover point with high pyruvate and low malate and low citrate [12] is consistent with a block at the pyruvate carboxylase reaction [17,18].
PMC5243144	R07009	The levels of malate and citrate were much lower in cell line pyruvate carboxylase 179
PMC5243144	R07010	1A than in the other two pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cell lines shown in Fig.
PMC5243144	R07011	6, and the level of pyruvate was increased less than in the other two cell lines in this cell line (only 24% higher than in the control cell line, as compared to 350% higher in the other two pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cell lines (Fig. 6)).
PMC5243144	R07012	Cell line pyruvate carboxylase 179
PMC5243144	R08000	The decreased levels of acetyl-CoA (Fig. 7C) and the decreased labeling of acetyl-CoA from glucose (Fig. 7D) in the pyruvate carboxylase 2096 4B cell line are also likely due to the decreased citrate levels.
PMC5243144	R08001	Most of the +2 labeled acetyl-CoA would be expected to come from the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction.
PMC5243144	R08002	However, there was slightly decreased +2 labeling of acetyl-CoA from glucose and from glutamine in the pyruvate carboxylase 2096 4B cell line (Fig. 7D) and this can only be explained by the decreased pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity inhibiting flux of citrate through the citrate-pyruvate cycle.
PMC5243144	R08003	The lower concentrations of total cellular acetyl-CoA (Fig. 7C) and lower 13C incorporation into acetyl-CoA (Fig. 7D) in the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cells are consistent with a lower cytosolic level of acetyl-CoA resulting from decreased formation of mitochondrial citrate and its export to the cytosol via the pathway that uses ATP citrate lyase shown in Fig. 4.
PMC5243144	R09002	Aspartate is produced directly from oxaloacetate catalyzed by aspartate aminotransferase.
PMC5243144	R09003	Suppression of pyruvate carboxylase expression should lower oxaloacetate, resulting in a lowered level of aspartate.
PMC5243144	R09004	As expected, the decrease of +2 and +3 aspartate from glucose and +4 labeled aspartate from glutamine in the pyruvate carboxylase 2096 4B cell line are consistent with a depleted oxaloacetate level caused by pyruvate carboxylase suppression in the case of labeling from glucose and decreased activity of the citrate-pyruvate cycle in the case of labeling from glutamine (Fig.
PMC5243144	R09006	Both pyruvate carboxylase 847 2C and pyruvate carboxylase 2096
PMC5243144	R10003	9 shows that suppression of pyruvate carboxylase decreased the incorporation of glucose carbon into palmitate.
PMC5243144	R10004	This is consistent with pyruvate carboxylase suppression inhibiting the mitochondrial synthesis of citrate and consequently the export of citrate to the cytosol thus lowering the supply of cytosolic acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA needed for fatty acid synthesis as depicted in Fig. 4.
PMC5243144	R11001	10 show several selected metabolites that were altered in the strong knockdown cell line pyruvate carboxylase 2096 4B or both pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cell lines.
PMC5243144	R11002	In addition to the metabolites discussed above moderate or strong suppression of pyruvate carboxylase resulted in the decreased levels of α-ketoglutarate, ADP-glucose, GDP-fucose and GDP-mannose while decreases in the levels of ribose-5-phosphate, CTP, hypoxanthine, UDP and GDP were observed only in the strong pyruvate carboxylase suppression cell line PC 2096 4B (Fig. 10 and Table 3).
PMC5243144	R12000	Suppression of pyruvate carboxylase caused no or a very slight and insignificant reduction of unlabeled and labeled ATP and ADP from glucose (Fig. 11, left panel) such that the ATP/ADP ratio was unaltered by pyruvate carboxylase knockdown.
PMC5243144	R12001	This indicates that the energy charge of the cell was not impaired by pyruvate carboxylase knockdown.
PMC5243144	R12002	The slightly decreased levels of ADP and ATP in the pyruvate carboxylase 2096 4B cell line may be linked to the lowered levels of ribose-5-phosphate (see Table 3 and Fig. 10), which supplies the ribose moiety of these nucleotides and/or decreased aspartate (Fig. 8) which contributes to nitrogen-donation in purine ring synthesis.
PMC5243144	R12003	The levels of NADH and NAD+ including NADH/NAD+ ratios were not different between the knockdown cells and the scramble control (Fig. 11) also indicating that the energy charge of the cell was not affected by pyruvate carboxylase not down.
PMC5243144	R13001	As shown in Fig. 4, these included cytosolic malic enzyme, NADP-isocitrate dehydrogenase, ATP-citrate lyase, glutamate dehydrogenase, aspartate aminotransferase and citrate synthase.
PMC5243144	R13002	The activity of only one enzyme in the pyruvate carboxylase knockdown cells was significantly different from that of the scrambled shRNA control cell line.
PMC5243144	R13003	This was malic enzyme and in two of the three cell lines with very low pyruvate carboxylase malic enzyme activity was about 50% lower than that of the control cell line (Fig. 12).
PMC5243144	R13004	Malic enzyme activity was not lower in the pyruvate carboxylase cell line with moderate knockdown of pyruvate carboxylase, PC 847 2C (Fig. 12).
PMC5243144	R13005	The shRNA nucleotide sequences used to target the pyruvate carboxylase mRNA were not similar to any of the nucleotide sequence of cytosolic malic enzyme mRNA.
PMC5243144	R13006	Therefore, the lower malic enzyme activities were probably a response to the effects of lower pyruvate carboxylase enzyme activity.
PMC5243144	R13007	The 50% lower activity of malic enzyme in the cell lines with severe knockdown of pyruvate carboxylase might contribute to the lower pyruvate levels seen in these cell lines (Fig. 5) due to lower pyruvate cycling from malate and citrate.
PMC5243144	R13009	Unfortunately the cell line pyruvate carboxylase 2096 4B with one of the lowest levels of pyruvate carboxylase and that was used for mass spectrometry studies would not grow after having been stored frozen so that the enzyme activities could not be measured in this cell line.

PMC5315374	D01004	Reduced glucosidase activity in the central nervous system [32–34] and in the periphery [35] has been associated with PD in many but not all [36,37] studies.
PMC5315374	D01005	The mechanism of the association between reduced glucosidase activity and PD is unknown, but one proposed mechanism would be alteration of lipids metabolized by glucosidase.
PMC5315374	D01007	Further support of a potential link between glucosidase activity, elevated GM3 and PD may be stipulated from Gaucher patients, who not only have a significantly greater risk of developing PD [30], but also show elevated plasma GM3 concentrations [38],[39].

PMC5315374	I00007	Further support of the importance of lipid dysregulation in PD is driven by genetic studies, where mutations in glucocerebrosidase (glucocerebrosidase) are strongly associated with PD
PMC5315374	I00009	glucocerebrosidase encodes the lysosomal enzyme β-glucosidase (glucosidase), which hydrolyzes glucosylceramide and glucosylsphingosine to ceramide and sphingosine, respectively, and plays a key role in the glycosphingolipid metabolic pathway.
PMC5315374	I00010	Diminished glucosidase activity as a result of homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in glucocerebrosidase leads to Gaucher disease, the most common genetic lysosomal storage disease.
PMC5315374	I00011	In addition to glucocerebrosidase, other lysosomal proteins have been associated with PD, e.g., acid sphingomyelinase [10] (SMPD1, deficient in Niemann-Pick disease types A and B) and LIMP-2 [11], a glucosidase transporter.
PMC5315374	R01003	Of note, in addition to GM3 and TG changes, 5 Cer species (i.e., glucosidase product) were significantly lower in PD than controls.

PMC5402394	R07000	First, we focused on the two main elongases named ELOVL (elongation of very long chain fatty acids), ELOVL5 and ELOVL6.
PMC5402394	R08000	The decrease in FADS1 desaturase activity in NASH may constitute a bottleneck leading to the accumulation of fatty acids upstream.
PMC5402394	R09000	To determine if changes in desaturase and elongase activities were related with their expression levels, liver mRNA gene expressions of ELOVL5, ELOVL6, FADS1, FADS2 and SCD1 were investigated by RT-Q-PCR on NASH compared to normal livers and NAFL matched NASH patients.
PMC5402394	R09011	Studies were further focused on genes related to de novo fatty acids synthesis such as sterol regulatory element-binding proteins 1c (SREBP1c), fatty acid synthase (FASN) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1) (Fig. 3).
PMC5413442	D01009	According to the authors this remarkable reduction can be explained by the altered activities and ratio across the three groups of patients of two monitored transaminases.
PMC5415862	F30002	The indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase) inhibitor 1-methyl-D-tryptophan upregulates IDO1 in human cancer cells.
PMC5417077	A00004	Glutaminase, which catalyzes glutamate formation from glutamine, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (aldehyde dehydrogenase), a stemness marker, were highly expressed in primary and metastatic head and neck cancer tissues, tumorspheres, and CSC versus controls.
PMC5417077	A00005	Exogenous glutamine induced stemness via glutaminase, whereas inhibiting glutaminase suppressed stemness in vitro and tumorigenesis in vivo.
PMC5417077	A00006	Head and neck CSC (CD44hi/ALDHhi) exhibited higher glutaminase, glutamate, and sphere levels than CD44lo/ALDHlo cells.
PMC5417077	A00007	Glutaminase drove transcriptional and translational aldehyde dehydrogenase expression, and glutamine directed even CD44lo/ALDHlo cells toward stemness.
PMC5417077	A00008	Glutaminolysis regulates tumorigenesis and CSC metabolism via aldehyde dehydrogenase.
PMC5417077	A00009	These findings indicate that glutamate is an important marker of cancer metabolism whose regulation via glutaminase works in concert with aldehyde dehydrogenase to mediate cancer stemness.
PMC5417077	D05000	Multiple mechanisms have been ascribed to aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) in promoting cancer metabolism, cancer chemoresistance, and CSC survival.
PMC5417077	D05002	aldehyde dehydrogenase can assist with the biosynthesis of retinoic acid, which is thought to be important in determining cell fate, cancer cell signaling, and gene expression.
PMC5417077	D05004	In terms of chemoresistance, ALDHs are capable of direct enzymatic inactivation of alkylating agents, such as cyclophosphamide.42,43 ALDHs can also confer resistance to other chemotherapeutic drugs, such as cisplatin and doxorubicin, although the mechanisms have not been fully delineated.44,45 Other evidence reveals that aldehyde dehydrogenase is often coexpressed with antioxidant factors.46 For a more comprehensive discussion about the role of aldehyde dehydrogenase in promoting cancer cell processes, the reader is directed to a recent review on this subject.47 Thus, ALDH seems to functionally promote multiple cancer cell processes via direct drug inactivation, promoting oxidative stress resistance, and mediating retinoic acid signaling mechanisms that favor cell survival and other tumorigenic processes.
PMC5417077	D05005	The current study has identified a new mechanism whereby aldehyde dehydrogenase can influence CSC properties.
PMC5417077	D05006	Specifically, this study has identified a novel relationship between the stemness marker aldehyde dehydrogenase and glutamate/glutaminase/glutaminolysis.
PMC5417077	D05007	The current data indicate a causal relationship between glutamate/glutaminase and aldehyde dehydrogenase levels.
PMC5417077	D05008	It is known that the active site of the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme requires priming by glutamate to catalyze the oxidation of aldehydes to carboxylic acids.
PMC5417077	D05009	Thus, it may be that glutaminase, by upregulating glutamate levels, regulates the priming of aldehyde dehydrogenase activity and ultimately aldehyde dehydrogenase levels.
PMC5417077	D05010	In aggregate, these findings indicate that stemness energetics are regulated, in part, by glutaminolysis, which regulates aldehyde dehydrogenase levels/functionality.
PMC5417077	D06000	Driving these elevated levels of glutaminolysis and aldehyde dehydrogenase in tumorigenesis may be mutations in the tumor promoter c-Myc or aldehyde dehydrogenase itself.
PMC5417077	D06003	Thus, Myc-mediated elevated glutamate levels may in turn drive the increase in aldehyde dehydrogenase levels that promote HNSCC stemness.
PMC5417077	D06004	Our data support this premise as the basis for the current findings, since c-Myc levels were elevated in tandem with glutaminase and aldehyde dehydrogenase levels in the human HNSCC tissue samples (Figure 6I and J and Supporting Information; Figure S2).
PMC5417077	D06005	Alternatively, mutations or polymorphisms in aldehyde dehydrogenase genes, several of which have been described, could confer a hyper-responsiveness to glutamate levels that then drive the stemness phenotype.49,50 For example, the glutamate to lysine single nucleotide polymorphism (Glu504Lys) was reported to have decreased activity of the aldehyde dehydrogenase enzyme and caused much higher blood levels of acetaldehyde; in a meta-analysis this showed an increased risk for cancer, especially esophageal cancer.50

PMC5417077	I03006	Glutamate, a key compound in cellular metabolism, is generated from glutamine by the enzyme glutaminase, whereas glutamine is synthesized by the enzyme glutamine synthetase from glutamate and ammonia.
PMC5417077	R06000	The enzyme glutaminase catalyzes the formation of glutamate from glutamine; therefore, glutaminase expression was also examined in these HNSCC tissues.
PMC5417077	R06001	Immunohistochemical staining analyses revealed that glutaminase expression was high in primary and metastatic HNSCC tissues compared to normal tissues (Figure 3E).
PMC5417077	R06002	These findings support that glutaminase and glutaminolysis are important markers for the transition to tumorigenesis and to a more aggressive metastatic phenotype in HNSCC.
PMC5417077	R07000	At the cellular level, HNSCC cells also exhibited significantly higher levels of glutaminase expression compared to normal human oral keratinocytes (Figure 3F).
PMC5417077	R07002	In summary, these validation studies showed that primary and metastatic HNSCC tissues and HNSCC cells exhibit highly active glutaminolysis marked by high glutamate levels, low glutamine levels, and high glutaminase expression.
PMC5417077	R08000	Cancer stemness is thought to contribute to tumorigenesis, and it may contribute to aggressive or metastatic tumor potential.13 To test the hypothesis that glutaminolysis promotes cancer stemness, glutaminase expression and glutamate levels were examined in the context of sphere assays.
PMC5417077	R08001	HNSCC spheres, designated tumorspheres, showed elevated levels of glutaminase expression compared to their counterpart adherent controls (Figure 4A).
PMC5417077	R08004	Exogenous addition of glutamine promoted tumorsphere formation and coincident glutaminase expression, whereas depriving cells of glutamine suppressed tumorsphere formation (Figure 4E and F).
PMC5417077	R09000	Chemically inhibiting glutaminase activity with 6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON), a glutamine antagonist, led to suppression of tumorsphere formation and decreased glutamate levels in HNSCC cells in vitro (Figure 5A and B).
PMC5417077	R09001	Similarly, stably suppressing glutaminase expression in these cells with lentiviral shRNA also abrogated HNSCC tumorsphere formation and glutamate levels in HNSCC cells in vitro (Figure 5C and D).
PMC5417077	R09002	Mouse tumors derived from HNSCC cells stably transduced with glutaminase shRNA exhibited significantly decreased tumor volumes.
PMC5417077	R10000	HNSCC cancer stem cells (CSCs) have been defined by high expression of the stem cell surface markers CD44 and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH).34,35 Using flow cytometry to isolate HNSCC CSCs (CD44hi/ALDHhi), we determined that these cells express high levels of glutaminase expression, and metabolic validation studies showed that they also exhibited high levels of glutamate compared to control cells (CD44lo/ALDHlo) (Figure 6A–C).
PMC5417077	R10003	CD44lo/ALDHlo cells cultured in glutamine-enriched media formed more tumorspheres and exhibited higher aldehyde dehydrogenase expression compared to cells cultured in nonenriched media (Figure 6E and F).
PMC5417077	R10004	Suppressing glutaminase expression in HNSCC cells resulted in transcriptional and translational suppression of aldehyde dehydrogenase expression (Figure 6G and H).

PMC5438387	D03010	ADMA operates by inhibiting competitively for NO synthase, thereby decreasing NO bioavailability, despite high L-arginine concentrations23.
PMC5438387	D03012	It is assumed that the reduced activity of the enzyme dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase) results in elevated ADMA concentration35.
PMC5438387	D03013	Attenuation of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase activity is influenced by factors like oxidized low-density lipoprotein cholesterol36, inflammatory cytokines, hyperhomocysteinemia37 and hyperglycemia38, thereby causing accumulation of ADMA and subsequent reduced NO synthesis.

PMC5444333	I01000	Metformin is a first-line T2DM therapy, with its primary role in loweringhyperglycemia due to suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis.8 Metformin is unique among antihyperglycemicagents, as it lowers the risk of diabetes-related end points, diabetes-relateddeath, myocardial infarction, and stroke relative to that of other glucose-loweringmedications.9 Metformin isalso unique in that it is linked to lower levels of AGEs.10,11While it is possible that AGE reduction is coupled exclusively to lowered glucoselevels, increased metabolism of MG by glyoxalase, and direct scavenging, have bothbeen postulated as mechanisms for this effect.12,13
PMC5448202	R13002	For this reason, it was proposed that glucose is phosphorylated by hexokinase and then oxidized to gluconate-6-phosphate in the oxidative branch of the PPP.

PMC5458273	D03003	As we know, Acetylcholinesterase was used to decompose acetylcholine, and low Acetylcholinesterase may lead to the accumulation of acetylcholine in the hepatocellular carcinoma, and our current study suggested that high intensity of Acetylcarnitine was associated with poor survival, which indicated that high Acetylcarnitine might promote the release of acetylcholine in ovarian cancer.

PMC5513203	D01013	A randomized clinical trial compared intravenous administration of the non-selective Nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor L-NG-methyl-L-arginine hydrochloride (546C88) with placebo.
PMC5513203	D01016	This can be explained by the fact that systemic inhibition of Nitric-oxide synthase in all tissues might be responsible for reducing signs of hypotension but may have an impact on capillary exchange or the immune response [6].
PMC5513203	D02015	However, if hArg has a higher Km value than lArg, we do not know if the catalytic efficiency of Nitric-oxide synthase is altered or if different Nitric-oxide synthase isoforms are preferentially metabolizing hArg during systemic inflammation and sepsis, which would explain why low hArg but not lArg levels correlated with disease severity in our study.
PMC5513203	D03001	Cecal ligation reduces survival in Nitric-oxide synthase knockout mice compared to wild-type animals [31]; and bone marrow transplantation of wild-type to Nitric-oxide synthase knockout mice increases release of cytokines such as TNF-α and was found to improve survival in a model of idiopathic pneumonia [32].
PMC5513203	D03005	In this context it has been shown that hArg can serve exclusively as a substrate for Nitric-oxide synthase in macrophages [43].
PMC5513203	D03006	Interestingly, the pharmacological transformation of hArg to the Nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor NH2-homoarginine results in significantly decreased NO production by macrophages [44].
PMC5513203	D04000	In addition to substrate availability, Nitric-oxide synthase activity is also regulated by the presence of Nitric-oxide synthase inhibitors.

PMC5513203	I00008	NO levels are reduced when Nitric-oxide synthase is inhibited by asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in a competitive manner.
PMC5513203	I00012	Therefore, concentrations of substrates and endogenous inhibitors of Nitric-oxide synthase are considered surrogate markers for NO bioavailability [6].
PMC5513203	I01003	NO activates guanylate cyclase, which induces VSM relaxation by increasing intracellular 3,5-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentration.
PMC5513203	I02000	Considering the known effects of NO on vascular function and the immune system, we sought to investigate whether plasma concentrations of Nitric-oxide synthase substrates (lArg and hArg) and of the Nitric-oxide synthase inhibitor ADMA, and whether DDAH2 expression in immune cells are altered in patients with sepsis and whether the magnitude of any such alterations is related to disease severity.

PMC5528902	D06004	In addition, it was reported that the activity of mitochondrial aconitase that catalyzes the interconversion of citrate to isocitrate was higher in MS patients, which may be related to our result showing low citrate levels were only observed in MS patients [68].

PMC5533870	D02001	Sarcosine levels are also regulated by sarcosine dehydrogenase (Sarcosine dehydrogenase), the enzyme that converts sarcosine back to glycine, and dimethylglycine dehydrogenase (Dimethylglycine dehydrogenase) which generates sarcosine from dimethylglycine (Sreekumar et al. 2009).
PMC5533870	D02007	Taken together, our results would support the idea of an interconversion between glycine/dimethylglycine and sarcosine through the activation of both DMGH and Glycine-N-methyltransferase, and the down-regulation of Sarcosine dehydrogenase.

PMC5848309	A00002	We investigated whether indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity, as measured by the ratio of Kyn to Trp, could be used to diagnose or predict active tuberculosis disease in HIV-infected adults.
PMC5848309	A02000	At the time of tuberculosis diagnosis, indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity was significantly higher in patients with tuberculosis than in controls (P < .001).
PMC5848309	A02001	Six months before tuberculosis diagnosis, indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity was significantly higher in all patients who later developed tuberculosis (P < .001) than controls.

PMC5848309	A02003	indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity was 4-fold higher in patients with tuberculosis than in those with pneumonia, and could be used to distinguish them.
PMC5848309	A02004	With a receiver operating characteristic curve, indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity had a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 99%, and positive and negative predictive values of 89% and 100% for detecting active tuberculosis disease.
PMC5848309	A03000	Plasma indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity is suitable as a biomarker of active tuberculosis in HIV-positive patients.
PMC5848309	D00000	We report a striking association between increased indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity and active tuberculosis disease among persons with HIV.
PMC5848309	D00001	Studies have proposed elevated indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity as prognostic in tuberculosis disease; however, no reports have discussed its diagnostic significance in HIV-infected patients.
PMC5848309	D00002	We assessed the diagnostic potential of elevated indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity in a longitudinal HIV-infected cohort followed up from 12 months before to 12 months after tuberculosis diagnosis.
PMC5848309	D01000	In controls (all HIV infected), followed up for >2 years, the median indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity was 0.16, ranging 2-fold from baseline.
PMC5848309	D01001	At tuberculosis diagnosis, the median indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity was 1.35, which was 12-fold different from baseline.
PMC5848309	D01002	indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity was mildly elevated with pneumonia but of lower magnitude than in tuberculosis disease.
PMC5848309	D01003	Our findings are consistent with the available literature [15, 16, 18] and may be linked to the immunosuppressive roles of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase
PMC5848309	D01005	indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity changes were due to increased product (Kyn) and decreased substrate (Trp) concentrations, but neither Kyn nor Trp levels alone had high diagnostic potential.
PMC5848309	D01006	Enzyme activity may not be detected with molecular, proteomic, or genomic analysis, which may explain why certain prior studies have not identified indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase as a candidate biomarker [5].
PMC5848309	D02000	Compared with patients with pneumonia, those with tuberculosis had about a 4-fold increase in plasma indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity, consistent with findings in HIV-negative individuals [15, 16].
PMC5848309	D02001	indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity, using a cutoff of 0.80, correctly classified all but 4 of 37 pneumonia cases as “not tuberculosis”; 1 of the 4 cases progressed to active tuberculosis within 6 months.
PMC5848309	D03002	indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 97%, 99%, 89%, and 100%.
PMC5848309	D04000	indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity showed no difference between bacteriologically proven and clinical tuberculosis, nor between pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis, although our sample size was small.
PMC5848309	D04001	Our results suggest that indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity may be useful for indicating the presence or absence of active tuberculosis disease in either site [21].
PMC5848309	D04002	Unlike interferon γ release assays, however, indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity seems to discriminate between active tuberculosis disease and latent or cured infection.
PMC5848309	D04003	Our data demonstrating indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity elevation in certain patients even 6 months before diagnosis suggest that, as a screening tool, indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity, with a cutoff of >0.8, could identify 1 in 5 patients (21%) who would progress to active disease within 6 months, decreasing morbid effects and transmission risk.
PMC5848309	D05000	indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity declined in all patients with tuberculosis within 6 months to levels comparable to those in controls, consistent with the literature [18].
PMC5848309	D05001	Administration of ART may also decrease indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase [22] but would probably not explain the difference between our 2 groups, because both were receiving ART.
PMC5848309	D05002	Plasma indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity may perhaps be used to monitor tuberculosis treatment.
PMC5848309	D05007	indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity offers potential to monitor treatment response because it is determined with a blood-based rather than sputum-based test and declines in response to treatment.
PMC5848309	D07002	CRP did not perform as well as indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity as a marker of active tuberculosis disease.
PMC5848309	D07004	Further research is needed to evaluate indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity in conditions clinically resembling tuberculosis, such as sarcoidosis [30].
PMC5848309	D08007	Utility for diagnosis of disseminated tuberculosis requires evaluation, particularly in patients with AIDS who have CD4 cell counts <200/µL. Conditions such as pregnancy and cancer may influence indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity, and its interpretation in such patients requires further study.
PMC5848309	D09003	Plasma indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity shows strong potential advantage over other proposed biomarkers.
PMC5848309	D10000	In conclusion, we found that plasma indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity, as measured by Kyn/Trp ratio using UPLC-MS/MS, had excellent validity in identifying active tuberculosis disease in HIV-infected adults.

PMC5848309	I01005	By reducing local Trp and producing immunomodulatory metabolites, indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase suppresses T-cell proliferation and function, resulting in immune suppression and tolerance [9].
PMC5848309	I01006	indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase regulates physiological functions, such as pregnancy [10], and modulates pathogenesis of diverse pathological conditions, including cancer [11] and infectious diseases [12, 13].

PMC5848309	I02005	[18] reported up-regulated indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase messenger RNA in sputum samples from patients with tuberculosis, with values that declined >500-fold after tuberculosis treatment.
PMC5848309	I02007	[15, 16] reported serum indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity significantly higher in patients with tuberculosis than in control subjects and indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity correlated with time to death.
PMC5848309	I02008	These data imply that elevated indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity may play a role in the pathogenesis of active tuberculosis disease.
PMC5848309	I02009	In HIV-infected individuals, the diagnostic significance of indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity is uncertain.

PMC5848309	R01004	indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity declined in all patients with tuberculosis after tuberculosis treatment to levels comparable to those in controls at visit 4 (median, 0.20 [IQR, 0.16–0.28] vs 0.17 [0.13–0.23]; P > .05).
PMC5848309	R02000	At the time of tuberculosis diagnosis, patients with tuberculosis had a median 12-fold [IQR, 9–20-fold] increase in indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity from baseline, whereas controls had median 2-fold [IQR, 1–4-fold] change over the entire study period (Figure 1D and ​and1E).1E).

PMC5848309	R02002	There was no difference in median indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity between patients with laboratory-confirmed tuberculosis and those with clinical tuberculosis (1.35 [IQR, 0.99–1.67] vs 1.34 [1.22–1.58]; P = .73; Figure 2).
PMC5848309	R03000	To determine whether plasma indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase activity could discriminate between active tuberculosis and other causes of lung disease, we evaluated 37 patients who presented with pneumonia (Figure 3).

PMC5976103	I01000	The kynurenine pathway is known to be upregulated as part of an activated immune response,9 and recently the tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway has been highlighted as a mechanism of central fatigue.10 11 The kynurenine pathway has an established role in depression where low plasma levels of tryptophan and elevated levels of metabolites, that is, increased kynurenine/tryptophan ratio, have been detected in the circulation and in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).12 In the kynurenine pathway (figure 1), two enzymes, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenases (IDO), are responsible for the first step where tryptophan is converted to kynurenine.
PMC5976103	I01002	IDO is mainly present in immune cells and known to be induced by interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin (IL-2), IL-1β, prostaglandin E2, oxidative stress and LPS.14 tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase is mainly expressed in the liver and regulated by the levels of tryptophan and by glucocorticoids.15 16 Higher kynurenine/tryptophan ratios, as a measure of IDO activity, have been reported in patients with SLE.17–19

PMC6020709	D01006	It has been demonstrated that hepatic sphingolipid synthesis is increased under inflammatory conditions [37], specifically through increased levels of the rate-limiting enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (serine palmitoyltransferase).

PMC6037419	D02002	The increased risk of death associated with increased levels of glucuronate (Tables 4 and ​and5)5) could correlate with altered glucuronidation in the liver (41) and/or increased beta-glucuronidase activity by the gut microbiota (e.g. Echerichia coli).(42) A study conducted using healthy and cirrhotic human livers showed the rate of glucuronidation was reduced in cirrhosis and in turn, impacted drug clearance.(41)
PMC6037419	D05002	Consistent with a previous report of impaired function of phenylalanine hydroxylase in cirrhosis (46), our findings suggest that dysfunction of the phenylalanine hydroxylase pathway exists and results in increased phenylalanine concentrations.
PMC6037419	D05003	Phenylalanine is transformed to tyrosine via phenylalanine hydroxylase which is a rate-limiting enzyme in phenylalanine catabolism.(24–26, 46)
PMC6037419	D05004	In phenylketonuria, which presents with intellectual disabilities and neurological symptoms, there is a deficiency of phenylalanine hydroxylase and therefore, phenylalanine is converted into phenylpyruvic acid instead of tyrosine.
PMC6037419	D05007	(24–26) High levels of 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate and phenyllactate observed in our subjects in high disease severity categories suggest dysfunction of phenylalanine hydroxylase resulting in increased phenylalanine concentrations.

PMC6037419	D07000	We also found significantly elevated methionine levels in subjects with MELD-Na between 20 and 40 which suggests down-regulation of MAT1A or dysfunction of the enzyme methionine adenosyltransferase (MAT) (P=0.001).
PMC6037419	D08001	We also found increased S-adenosylhomocysteine levels in subjects with high liver and kidney disease severity and this can also be due to down-regulation of the enzyme betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (betaine homocysteine methyltransferase).
PMC6037419	D08002	betaine homocysteine methyltransferase was shown to be down-regulated in bile duct ligation-induced cirrhosis in rats (56) and down-regulation of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase may result in accumulation of betaine and homocysteine, reduction in hepatic S-adenosylmethionine levels, hypomethylated DNA, and altered transcriptional activity.(56) Betaine functions as a methyl donor and methylates homocysteine to generate methionine, a process that produces N, N-dimethylglycine.(27, 51, 56–60) Increased betaine and methionine levels in subjects with cirrhosis at increased risk of death suggests the possibility that BHMT levels, its activity, or that of another methionine cycle enzyme may be altered.
PMC6037419	D08003	In addition to down-regulation of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase, up-regulation of betaine homocysteine methyltransferase was also reported in cirrhosis.(61) Up-regulation of BHMT may result in depletion of betaine in cirrhosis.(57, 61, 62)

PMC6112131	D03007	In view of these complementary vasodilator effects described for of BNP and PVAT and comprising both the activation of cGMP-dependent protein kinase, it is tempting to assume that increased BNP may directly relate to enhanced adiponectin release from adipocytes.
PMC6112131	D03010	Adiponectin in turn alters lipoprotein metabolism on different levels, e.g. by suppressing hepatic lipase activity [36] or promoting activation of lipoprotein lipase [37, 38].
PMC6112131	D03011	Taken together, a potential pathway that may contribute to the improved lipoprotein profile associated with NT-proBNP might rely on BNP signaling on adipocytes and NPR-A activation promoting cGMP-dependent protein kinase elevation followed by enhanced adiponectin release which finally influences lipoprotein metabolism (Fig. 5).
PMC6112131	D04003	In line with this, in patients with T2DM levels of circulating adiponectin was lower in serum compared to normoglycemic subjects and vascular free radical formation related to NADPH oxidase was increased, which in turn activated PVAT to increase adiponectin expression in response to increased free radical formation [41].

PMC6136796	R03005	The C-4 demethylation in two nonconsecutive steps is a feature of land plants.[12] In this work, by using molecular probes with the corresponding MOA, we mapped enzymatic steps downstream of CYP51, including sterol C8→C7-double bond isomerization, catalyzed by ERG2, and sterol C24-methylation, catalyzed by sterol C24-methyltransferase (ERG6).
PMC6136796	R05000	Exposure of N. fowleri to the sterol C24-methyltransferase inhibitors 24,25-epiminolanosterol (epiminolanosterol), abafungin and 25-azacycloartenol (25-Aza), led to high accumulation of cholesta-5,7,24-trienol (6) (≥30% of total sterols), an intermediate undetectable in the wild-type or posaconazole-inhibited N. fowleri (Table 1, Fig 2).
PMC6136796	R05001	This finding made three intermediates, 5, 8 and 6, potential candidates for endogenous sterol C24-methyltransferase substrates in N. fowleri.

PMC6136796	R06000	To identify what configuration of the double-bond(s) in the sterol B-ring favors Naegleria sterol C24-methyltransferase catalysis, the studies using recombinant enzyme and individually isolated sterol intermediates were conducted.
PMC6136796	R06001	In the N. gruberi genome, two candidate genes encoding sterol C24-methyltransferase (77.6% sequence identity) were identified (S1 Table), which resemble those of higher plants in primary sequence (~50% identity).

PMC6181287	D02000	PCOS is defined as not being overlapping with androgen excess due to CAH, mostly 21-hydroxylase deficiency [1,2].
PMC6181287	D02001	Some studies of ovarian steroidogenesis suggest that in PCOS activities of HSD3B2 and CYP17-17,20 lyase are enhanced [26].
PMC6181287	D02003	Increased 5α reductase activity in PCOS has been suggested from clinical studies [15,25], and was also suggested from immunohistochemical studies looking at ovarian tissues [13].
PMC6181287	D02004	In our study, we found an increase in 21-hydroxylase, 11β-hydroxylase, 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase (Δ4) as well as 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity in PCOS (Fig 1).
PMC6181287	D02005	By contrast, we found no clear difference for 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity.
PMC6181287	D03001	In both studies, 5α reductase activity seemed increased when looking at its activity within the backdoor pathway (11βOHET/11βOHAT), but not with respect to its activity in the degradation of mineralocorticoids (THB/5αTHB) and glucocorticoids (THF/5αTHF).
PMC6181287	D03003	As 5α reductase activity is essential to yield androgen precursor metabolites for DHT production, this indicates that in PCOS an increase in BMI will enhance 5α-dependent androgen production.
PMC6181287	D04000	Concerning 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activities, we found an increased type 2 and decreased type 1 activity, but no change in absolute cortisol excretion.
PMC6181287	D04004	[25,28], while our study revealed diminished 20αHSD and 20β-HSD activities, but an increase in 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity assessed by the conversion of αTHF and THF to 20αDHF.
PMC6181287	D04005	20α-HSD activity is mainly promoted by AKR1C1, but may also be promoted by any other member of the AKR1C superfamily of aldo/keto reductases, which are also known as 3αHSDs.
PMC6181287	D04011	Thus increased 3αHSD activity might be characteristic for hyperandrogenic PCOS similar to increased 17α-hydroxylase/17,20 lyase activity and 5α reductase activity.
PMC6181287	D06005	Importantly, two steroid profiles originating from suboptimal treated patients with 21-hydroxylase CAH clearly discriminated from both controls and PCOS when looking at the 21-hydroxylase activity and at the newly developed PCOS activity ratios.

PMC6181287	I02009	It has been reported that in PCOS increased 5α reductase activity converts androstenedione to androstanedione, which is then converted to DHT
PMC6181287	I02011	In line with that, we found increased 5α reductase expression in PCOS ovaries [13].
PMC6181287	R02003	Steroid metabolite substrate to product conversion ratios representing 21-hydroxylase activity were lower in PCOS indicating an increased 21-hydroxylase activity in PCOS compared to controls.
PMC6181287	R02005	Thus 21-hydroxylase deficiency could be clearly excluded in our PCOS patients.
PMC6181287	R02006	3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) activity seemed lower in PCOS, but this association to PCOS disappeared after multivariable adjustment.
PMC6181287	R02007	By contrast, a higher enzyme activity was found in PCOS for the activities of 11β-hydroxylase, and the Δ4-pathway activity of 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, as well as for the P450 oxidoreductase activity.
PMC6181287	R02008	For the activity of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase multivariable analyses indicated no difference.
PMC6181287	R02009	Similarly, no clear difference was found for the ratio yielding androgen synthesis through the backdoor pathway or for 5α reductase activity.
PMC6181287	R02010	A lower activity in PCOS was found for aromatase after adjusting for age and BMI.
PMC6181287	R02011	A higher 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) type 2 and a lower 11β-HSD type 1 activity was found for PCOS for some calculated ratios, whereas other ratios indicated no difference.
PMC6181287	R02012	The activities of 20α- and 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (20α/β-HSD) were both lower in PCOS, while 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) activity was higher in PCOS.
PMC6181287	R06000	Finally for proof of principal, we tested the identified diagnostic classifiers on 12 urinary steroid profiles that were recently analyzed in our GC-MS laboratory: 10 urines were from suspected PCOS women and sent for excluding 21-hydroxylase deficiency, 2 samples originated from subjects with 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

PMC6273014	R03002	Considering the interconnected biosynthetic and catabolic pathways of the polyamine metabolome described in Figure 1, putrescine was derived from l-ornithine by ornithine decarboxylase (ornithine decarboxylase) catalysis.
PMC6273014	R03003	Putrescine was converted into spermidine by spermidine synthetase catalysis, and spermidine was further transformed into spermine by spermine synthetase.
PMC6273014	R03004	It can be inferred that the major differences between liver and lung cancer cell proliferation in blood circulation were a remarkable increase of ornithine decarboxylase and spermidine synthetase activity, and a decrease of spermine synthetase activity.
PMC6273014	R03007	Further research is required to study the main reasons affecting the activity changes of ornithine decarboxylase, spermidine synthetase and spermine synthetase.
PMC6273014	R03011	It is suggested that during the blood clearance and metabolism process, the pathway from S-adenosyl-l-methionine to N-acetylspermidine was restrained during the liver cancer cell proliferation, while spermine synthetase, flavin adenine dinucleotide–polyamine oxidase (flavin adenine dinucleotide-polyamine oxidase) and spermidine/spermine N-acetyltransferase (spermidine and spermine acetyl transferase) manifested lower activity in the cell proliferation of liver cancer than lung cancer.
PMC6273014	R03012	Thus further studies should be done on the influence of the decreasing activity of spermine synthetase, flavin adenine dinucleotide-polyamine oxidase and spermidine and spermine acetyl transferase.

PMC6318037	A00003	Furthermore, it is demonstrated that anchorage-independent TNBC utilizes the tryptophan catabolizing enzyme tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase) to inhibit CD8 T cell viability.
PMC6318037	A00004	Publicly available data revealed that high TDO2, the gene encoding tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, correlates with poor breast cancer clinical outcomes, including overall survival and distant metastasis-free survival, while expression of the gene encoding the more commonly studied tryptophan catabolizing enzyme IDO1 did not.
PMC6318037	D00000	While tryptophan catabolism is known to mediate tumor immune evasion, the impact of indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase or tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase activity on CD8 T cells was thought to occur through indirect suppression via regulatory T cell activation.
PMC6318037	D00002	We previously reported that tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase activity increased in TNBC cell lines under anchorage-independent conditions, resulting in increased intracellular and secreted kynurenine (10).
PMC6318037	D00003	Critically, we show here that conditioned media from TNBC cells cultured under anchorage-independent conditions decreases the viability and IFNγ production of primary human CD8 T cells, and that this effect is abrogated by the specific tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase inhibitor 680C91, indicating that anchorage-independent TNBC cells are highly immunosuppressive in part through TDO-mediated activity.
PMC6318037	D01000	Although inhibition of tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase activity in suspended TNBC cells abrogated the effects of conditioned media on the viability and function of CD8 cells, inhibition of the receptor for kynurenine, AhR, in the CD8 cells was not sufficient to mitigate this effect.
PMC6318037	D01001	One possible explanation for the differential effects of tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase as compared to AhR inhibition is that the effect of tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase activity on CD8 T cells is due to the combined effects of both tryptophan depletion and kynurenine secretion.
PMC6318037	D02009	In a previous study, we found that expression of KYNU, the gene encoding kynureninase (an enzyme downstream of TDO) is elevated in suspended TNBC cell lines and in the context of increased inflammatory signaling (10), which would be consistent with tryptophan catabolism further down the pathway.
PMC6318037	D02012	Development of better antibodies to measure tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase or gauge activity will be a significant hurdle to overcome in the quest for biomarkers indicative of patients who may benefit from tryptophan catabolism-targeted therapies.

PMC6318037	I01000	We previously discovered that aberrant expression and activity of the hepatic tryptophan-catabolizing enzyme tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase) in TNBC cell lines supports anchorage-independent cell growth and late-stage metastasis through an autocrine mechanism, whereby the tryptophan catabolite kynurenine activates the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in the breast cancer cells (10).
PMC6318037	I01002	Most studies have focused on the tryptophan catabolizing enzyme indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase) in cancer, and current inhibitors of this pathway in clinical trials only target indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase activity.
PMC6318037	I01003	indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase transcript correlates with poor prognosis and increased microvessel density in breast cancer (13).
PMC6318037	I01005	Importantly, recent negative clinical trial results in melanoma (the ECHO-301 trial) and pancreatic cancer (ECHO-203), suggest that indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase inhibitors are not sufficient for the reversal of tumor immune evasion (14) and indicate that it may be necessary to target tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase as well.
PMC6318037	R01000	We previously reported that TNBC cells surviving under anchorage-independent culture conditions increased expression and activity of tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, resulting in increased intracellular and secreted kynurenine (10).
PMC6318037	R01007	To determine if the effects of SUS CM were due to increased tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase activity, TNBC cells were plated in ATT or SUS conditions with or without TDO-specific inhibitor 680C91 for 48 hours.
PMC6318037	R01008	While SUS CM again increased CD8 T cell death, this effect was significantly abrogated when SUS cells were treated with tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase inhibitor 680C91 (Figure 2D), suggesting that tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase activity is at least partially responsible for the CM effect.

PMC6335671	I00008	5'-DFUR would be preferably metabolized to 5-FU in tumor tissue by activity-enhanced thymidine phosphorylase with more than 10 times higher concentration of product compared with other normal tissue [4].
PMC6335671	I00010	It had been reported that approximately 80% of 5-FU is catabolized to inactive product dihydrofluorouracil (FUH2) by the rate-limiting enzyme dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase) in liver, and declined activity of dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase often caused a longer retention of 5-FU [5–7].
PMC6335671	I00012	The antitumor activity of 5-FU usually worked through three metabolic pathways: the first pathway was the anabolism of 5-FU to fluorouridine triphosphate and incorporating the product into RNA, and finally damage the structure of RNA; the second pathway was similar with the first mechanism and deoxyfluorouridine triphosphate was produced to damage the DNA structure; the third way was anabolism of fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate from fluorouridine monophosphate or 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (2'-DFUR), and then a ternary complex would be formed with thymidylate synthetase and folic acid to suppress the synthesis of thymidine.

PMC6358190	I01004	thiopurine methyltransferase activity is inherited in a codominant pattern: individuals who are homozygotes of the variant genotype have reduced activity of the enzyme, although allele frequency of the variant is lower in far-east Asians than in whites.3 Standard dose of 6MP in patients with the homozygote variant of thiopurine methyltransferase potentially produces extensive 6TGN, which may cause life-threatening
PMC6358190	I01006	In addition, heterozygous patients with 2 different single-nucleotide polymorphisms on the 2 thiopurine methyltransferase alleles exhibit similar patterns to homozygous patients, and they are exposed to a substantial risk of developing myelosuppression at standard doses of thiopurine drugs.6

PMC6365407	D02002	Both rat and human studies show that the kidney is the main site of serine production.42 Although some serine is produced by regeneration from glycine (15%), most (>50%) comes from TCA-cycle intermediates that are converted into phosphoenolpyruvate by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase.41 Serine is required for cellular and tissue growth in general and for the nervous system in particular.43 It acts as neurotransmitters, is important for the catalytic activity of many enzymes, and is an important building block of many lipids.
PMC6365407	D04001	In general, the first step from tyrosine to L-DOPA, which is catalyzed by tyrosine hydroxylase, is regarded as the rate-limited step in this process.
PMC6365407	D04002	However, for the much higher levels of intrarenal dopamine, expression of L-DOPA-decarboxylase as well as availability of L-DOPA substrate, could be of additional importance.47 Intrarenal dopamine has been found to account for more than 50% of the kidney’s salt excretion ability and is therefore of great importance for blood pressure control.48, 49

PMC6365407	D06001	Urine tyrosine has previously been found to be reduced in early CKD16, 73 and in patients with end-stage renal disease,74, 75 and this is caused by reduced phenylalanine-hydroxylase enzyme activity,45 also demonstrated in our study.
PMC6365407	D06002	Even though we found no change in renal expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, which is considered the rate-limiting enzyme in catecholamine synthesis, production of L-DOPA could still be hampered in CKD.

PMC6525389	A02004	Glutaminase activity was decreased after plasma treatment, which might lead to glutamine accumulation and leukemia cells death.
PMC6525389	D00017	The first step of glutamine catabolism occurs through the activation of glutaminase (glutaminase), which catalyzes the conversion of glutamine to glutamic acid.
PMC6525389	D00018	Inhibition of glutaminase can inhibit leukemia cell growth and even induce apoptosis [34].
PMC6525389	D00020	In order to determine its reason, we investigated that glutaminase activity in leukemia cells after plasma treatment, and the result showed that glutaminase activity was decreased.

PMC6525389	D00022	However, when added glutamate to leukemia cells inhibited glutaminase activity, we found increased relative cell activity.
PMC6525389	D00023	The above results showed that CAP treatment could inhibit the glutaminase activity of leukemia cells so that glutamine was not able to be normally metabolized to produce glutamic acid and thus accumulated, which might lead to leukemia cells death due to the lack of required nutrients.

PMC6525389	R11002	Moreover glutaminase (glutaminase) is overexpressed in many tumor cells and converts glutamine to glutamic acid, which is then converted to ∝-KG and introduced into TCA cycle [25].
PMC6525389	R11003	We therefore hypothesized that glutaminase activity of plasma-treated leukemia cells was reduced and glutamine could not be normally metabolized and converted to glutamic acid, which suppressed the proliferation of leukemia cells and even leaded to leukemia cells apoptosis.
PMC6525389	R12000	To determine whether the differentially metabolic pathway and the differential metabolite were responsible for leukemia cells death, we analyzed glutaminase activity of leukemia cells before and after plasma treatment.

PMC6680906	D00008	If during high-intensive exercise the ATP degradation rate in muscle is higher than the ATP resynthesis rate, accumulated hypoxanthine can be partly reconverted to inosine monophosphate (IMP) by the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase), thus contributing to ATP restoration, or it leaks out to the blood stream where a further degradation to uric acid or a direct elimination from body via urine occurs [33,35,36,37].
PMC6680906	D01010	Hellsten-Westing et al. demonstrated that the attenuation in hypoxanthine efflux after a six-week HIIT in habitually active men was associated with a training-induced, elevated activity of the purine salvage enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase in muscle [45].
PMC6680906	D01011	As hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase catalyzes the reconversion of hypoxanthine to IMP [35], its intensified activity following HIIT was interpreted as a training-induced adaptation to enhance the conservation of muscle purine nucleotides [45].

PMC6680906	D02004	As one possible metabolic adaptation to the short-term HIIT, an elevated hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity in skeletal muscle could be suggested.
PMC6680906	D02005	However, if muscular hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity actually increased after ten days of HIIT, it is still questionable to what extent a more efficient salvage in muscle is likely to explain the decrease in urinary hypoxanthine excretion at rest.
PMC6680906	D02008	As recently shown, not only hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity in skeletal muscle but also hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase activity in erythrocytes is exercise- and training-dependent [48,49,50].

PMC6719621	R14001	Surprisingly, we found that arylformamidase knockdown led to a reproducible but marginal reduction in Kyn synthesis that did not always meet statistical significance (Supplemental Fig.
PMC6719621	R14003	Given that arylformamidase is necessary for Kyn synthesis (Fig. 2A), it is possible that siRNA-mediated knockdown was not sufficient to significantly impair arylformamidase activity.
PMC6719621	R14004	Attempts to generate colon cancer cells lines that have arylformamidase knocked out have not been successful.
PMC6719621	R14005	Moreover, previous studies based on arylformamidase knockout mice have suggested that other, yet uncharacterized genes may compensate for the loss of arylformamidase in some organs, such as the kidneys (Dobrovolsky et al. 2005).

PMC6857457	D04000	Impairment of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation has been associated with elevated circulating fatty acid derivatives such as acylcarnitines and reduced ketone bodies in plasma.25,32 Fatty acid β-oxidation is a multistep process that involves entry of the fatty acid into the cytosol, activation to acyl-CoA by conjugation with coenzyme A in the cytosol, conversion to acylcarnitine by the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1, transport across the inner mitochondrial membrane by the transporter carnitine translocase, and then conversion back to acyl-CoA by carnitine palmitoyltransferase-2 inside the mitochondrion, where fatty acid oxidation (β-oxidation) takes place (Figure 6A).35
PMC6857457	D05005	Likewise, there is evidence that circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine levels increase in conditions of oxidative stress.44,45 Asymmetric dimethylarginine is a product of methylation of arginine residues in proteins by the action of protein-arginine methyltransferases.46 Because more than 90% of asymmetric dimethylarginine generated is metabolized by dimethylargine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH),47 hepatic dimethylargine dimethylaminohydrolase activity is an important determinant of circulating asymmetric dimethylarginine levels.48,49 dimethylargine dimethylaminohydrolase is known to be highly sensitive to oxidative stress because of the presence of sulfhydryl groups at the active site, and it has been shown that oxidative stress inactivates this enzyme by modifying critical cysteine residues in its active site.50,51 As such, inactivation of DDAH because of irinotecan-induced oxidative stress may lead to the accumulation of asymmetric dimethylarginine in the liver, which would be subsequently released into circulation (Figure 7C).
PMC6857457	D05007	The conversion of methionine to cysteine is rate-limited by cystathionine β-synthase, whose activity is regulated by the redox balance.55,56 Under conditions of oxidative stress, activation of cystathionine β-synthase would enhance conversion of methionine to cystathionine and then cysteine, leading to enhanced synthesis of glutathione, which serves as an autocorrective response to an oxidative insult (Figure 7D).29 Interestingly, N-α-acetyllysine was identified as the most significantly changed amino acid metabolite on irinotecan/SN-38 exposure in both patient plasma and HepatoCells medium.
PMC6857457	D05008	The acetylation of lysine residues in proteins has been known as an important mechanism of epigenetics, whereby histone acetyltransferases catalyze the addition of acetyl groups from acetyl-CoA onto the lysine residues of histones and nonhistone proteins.

PMC6948762	A03001	Renal acetyl-CoA carboxylase activation accompanies these lipidomic changes and suggests that it may be the underlying mechanism linking lipid abnormalities to DKD progression.
PMC6948762	D01004	Importantly, the ability to perform integrative renal gene expression with serum lipids has uncovered acetyl-CoA carboxylase (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) activation as a critical determinant.
PMC6948762	D01005	Consequently, acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibition might be a therapeutic strategy to prevent DKD or slow its progression.
PMC6948762	D01006	Not all patients with diabetes develop DKD; therefore, the possible contribution of acetyl-CoA carboxylase polymorphisms to renal outcomes needs to be investigated.
PMC6948762	D03008	Overall, the main renal toxicities are determined by saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate, through mechanisms that involve activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin complex-1 (mTOR1) signaling pathways.
PMC6948762	D03011	Within the tubulointerstitial compartment, palmitate upregulates the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, leading to intracellular activation of DAG followed by protein kinase C (PKC), which further promotes renal tubular cell injury (43).
PMC6948762	D03016	This probably reflects a lower abundance of fatty acids with 14 or more carbons, which become the dominant mitochondrial substrates in progressors whose mitochondrial shuttling of fatty acids with 16 or more carbons is impaired because of carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT1) inhibition (50).
PMC6948762	D04001	G proteins promote transcriptional activation of metabolic genes by carbohydrate-response element-binding protein and regulate downstream lipogenic genes, including ACACA, fatty acid synthetase, acyl CoA synthase, and glycerol phosphate acyl transferase (51).
PMC6948762	D04002	In particular, the significant association of ACACA gene expression with DAGs in the glomerular and TAGs in the tubulointerstitial compartments supports the hypothesis that the observed differential serum lipids may be regulated, in part, by renal acetyl-CoA carboxylase.
PMC6948762	D04003	The direct correlation of shorter low-double-bond DAGs with elongase and desaturase imply that a higher abundance of such lipids may upregulate the renal cortical elongation and desaturation of fatty acids as a compensatory mechanism that converts shorter and relatively more saturated, toxic lipids into longer, relatively more unsaturated, less toxic products.
PMC6948762	D05001	De novo lipogenesis of long chain fatty acids is dependent on the activity of 3 cytosolic enzymes: ATP citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and fatty acid synthetase (53).
PMC6948762	D05002	acetyl-CoA carboxylase is a key regulatory enzyme in lipogenesis, and its activity is under hormonal regulation by insulin, glucagon, and epinephrine.
PMC6948762	D05003	During insulin resistance, increased insulin promotes acetyl-CoA carboxylase activation via its protein phosphatase–mediated dephosphorylation (54).
PMC6948762	D05004	A recent expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis of participants of the Nephrotic Syndrome Study Network revealed a significant differential expression of G/C ACACA variant in both glomerular and tubulointerstitial compartments of the participants (55), suggesting the possibility of ACACA polymorphism on acetyl-CoA carboxylase activity.
PMC6948762	D05005	acetyl-CoA carboxylase activation inhibits CPT1, lowering cytosolic conversion of long chain acyl CoA to long chain AC, decreases substrate for the carnitine shuttle, impairs β-oxidation of long chain fatty acids, and increases cytosolic abundance of palmitate (53).
PMC6948762	D05006	Increased palmitate promotes elongation and desaturation, as evidenced by upregulation of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) 1 and 2 (Figure 9 and ref. 56).
PMC6948762	D06001	Upregulation of renal (and possibly liver) acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the diabetic milieu enhances de novo lipogenesis, which generates excess saturated fatty acids (e.g., palmitate).
PMC6948762	D06002	Although kidney acetyl-CoA carboxylase expression is modified, the liver may also influence circulating levels of fatty acids and complex lipids.
PMC6948762	D06004	In addition, acetyl-CoA carboxylase upregulation can inhibit CPT1, which impairs β-oxidation.
PMC6948762	D08001	Although existing knowledge of the de novo lipogenesis pathway, along with the results obtained from the transcriptomic-lipidomic integrative analysis, support the hypothesis that acetyl-CoA carboxylase activation may be responsible, in part, for the differential lipid pattern, our results cannot distinguish whether the increased renal acetyl-CoA carboxylase expression is a cause or a consequence of the differential plasma lipid profile.
PMC6948762	D09006	The underlying mechanism may depend on impairment of fatty acid β-oxidation and renal acetyl-CoA carboxylase activation, thus providing a potential therapeutic target (Figure 9).

PMC7001531	D01003	As shown in the arginine metabolic pathway (Figure 7A), arginine is the precursor of nitric oxide (NO), and NO is synthesized from L-arginine by nitric oxide synthase (nitric oxide synthase), which includes neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nnitric oxide synthase), endothelial NOS (eNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS).
PMC7001531	D01008	Arginase (also present in the brain) is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of arginine to ornithine, competing with eNOS (in the choroid plexus and vascular endothelium) for arginine (28).
PMC7001531	D01009	A high concentration of arginine could stimulate the expression and activation of arginase, and the maximal catalytic activity of arginase is higher than that of eNOS (15, 28).
PMC7001531	D01010	The increase of arginase activity will decrease the catalytic activity of arginine for NO production and lead to the uncoupling of eNOS, while uncoupled eNOS can induce the transfer of electrons from NADPH to oxygen molecules to form superoxide anions (O2-).

PMC7017805	A00000	Dysregulation of the kynurenine pathway has been regarded as a mechanism of tumor immune escape by the enzymatic activity of indoleamine 2, 3 dioxygenase and kynurenine production.
PMC7017805	A00002	In this study, plasma from patients diagnosed with metastatic cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) was obtained before (PRE) and during treatment (TRM) with inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway (MAPKIs).
PMC7017805	D00006	Also, the complex interplay of the activity of the KP component may imply the existence of a feedback mechanism; e.g., kynurenine 3-monooxygenase activity is one determinant of KYNA production by regulating the amount of KYN substrate available to KATs (60).
PMC7017805	D03001	3-HK and KYNA interactions in the PRE network identify groups of proteins such as CXCL13, IL-8, TIE2, ADGRG1, CCL20, and CXCL9 to be involved in Tie2 and SHP2 signaling with an inhibitory effect on Th1 differentiation (51–54) Interaction of Tie2, a tyrosine kinase receptor, with its ligand angiopoietin-1(Ang1), regulates angiogenesis which makes it an attractive target for cancer therapy (53).
PMC7017805	D03004	The tyrosine-protein phosphatase non-receptor type 11 (PTPN11), also known as SHP-2, is a critical intracellular regulator that mediates cell proliferation and differentiation (63).
PMC7017805	D08001	However, it is previously reported that lower level of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, 3-HK, and 3HAA is associated with less proliferative and exhausted CD4+ T-cells (67).
PMC7017805	D09000	It is also reported that KYN potentiates the activity of the MAPK-ERK1/2 pathway (69), and inhibition of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway increases the serum levels of IFNγ and TNF-α (70).
PMC7017805	D09001	IFN-γ and TNF-α also induce kynurenine 3-monooxygenase, KYNU expression as well as 3-HK production (71, 72).
PMC7017805	D09002	Therefore, we speculated that inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway with MAPKIs impair the balance between mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways with KP activity and therefore activates compensatory feedback loops to elevate KP activation toward 3-HK and 3-HAA production.
PMC7017805	D10002	Besides, strengthening kynurenine 3-monooxygenase or KYNU activity leads to the utilization of KYN, and decreasing the excess amount of KYN in the plasma triggers immune evasion, a result that could restore immune surveillance (19).

PMC7065026	A00000	A sensitive and selective ultra‐high performance liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS) method for the simultaneous determination of seven oral oncolytics (two PARP inhibitors, i.e. olaparib and niraparib, and five tyrosine kinase inhibitors, i.e. cobimetinib, cabozantinib, dabrafenib, vemurafenib and regorafenib, plus its active metabolite regorafenib M2) in EDTA plasma was developed and validated.
PMC7065026	D01000	Numerous methods have been developed for the quantification of combinations of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.
PMC7065026	D01001	One of the main difficulties of the analysis of multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors is the large difference in clinically relevant concentrations for some of them.
PMC7065026	D01002	Vemurafenib has a target trough concentration of 42,000 μg/L which is several times higher than the levels of other tyrosine kinase inhibitors included in our method (Goldwirt et al., 2016).
PMC7065026	D01003	Quantification methods of vemurafenib combined with other tyrosine kinase inhibitors that have been previously published, use solid‐phase extraction (Rousset et al., 2017), protein precipitation with methanol followed by a step of evaporation (Cardoso et al., 2018) and protein precipitation with acetonitrile and zinc‐sulfate for sample preparation (Huynh et al., 2017).

PMC7084352	D00034	Correspondingly, it was the only Arginine N-methyltransferase here negatively associated with the expression of proliferation marker PCNA.
PMC7084352	D01007	As Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase enzymes are known mostly as ADMA-metabolizing enzymes and ADMA is primarily implicated in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases [47], little, if not nothing, is known on DDAHs in IBD.
PMC7084352	D01016	Instead, SDMA is mostly excreted with urine, although its degradation by alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2) has been shown [47].
PMC7084352	D01018	Nonetheless, in addition to Dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase overexpression, DDAH1 was associated with IBD angiogenesis as VEGFA and TP53 were independent predictors of its expression in both quiescent and inflamed bowel.
PMC7084352	D02007	The Nitric oxide synthase enzymes use arginine for NO synthesis; however, active IBD is reportedly accompanied by downregulated expression of cationic amino acid transporter 2, responsible for arginine up-take, causing mucosal arginine concentrations to be diminished and inversely related to the disease activity [24].

PMC7084352	D05001	It is worth mentioning that putrescine, a direct substrate in polyamine synthesis, can be formed from arginine also via agmatine [63] and therefore can facilitate tissue regeneration by bypassing the ARG and Ornithine decarboxylase enzymes.
PMC7084352	D05002	Accordingly, agmatinase expression has been demonstrated in the small intestine and immune cells.
PMC7084352	D05010	ODC1 overexpression may increase susceptibility to neoplastic transformation as polyamines are involved in epigenetic regulation of gene expression by interacting with histone acetyltransferases, deacetylases, and demethylase and thus affecting chromatin state and global transcription [67].
