PMC2764366	A01000	In a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants influencing LDL-C in an isolated population from Kosrae, we observed associations for SNPs in the gene encoding HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR).
PMC2764366	A01003	In vitro studies in human lymphoblastoid cells demonstrated that homozygosity for the rs3846662 minor allele was associated with up to 2.2-fold lower expression of alternatively spliced HMGCR mRNA lacking exon13 and minigene transfection assays confirmed that allele status at rs3846662 directly modulated alternative splicing of HMGCR exon13 (42.9±3.9 vs. 63.7±1.0 %Δexon13/total HMGCR mRNA, p=0.02).
PMC2764366	A02000	We identified variants in HMGCR that are associated with LDL-C across populations and affect alternative splicing of HMGCR exon13.
PMC2764366	D00000	We identified variants in the HMGCR gene that were among our top hits for LDL-C in a GWAS in a population from the Island of Kosrae.
PMC2764366	D00001	We then conducted in vitro studies to follow-up the association signals and to identify a functional variant at the HMGCR locus.
PMC2764366	D00002	We present evidence that a common intronic SNP (rs384662) that is in linkage disequilibrium with the variants typed in the genome scan modulates alternative splicing of HMGCR mRNA.

PMC2764366	D01000	HMG-CoA reductase is a key enzyme in cholesterol homeostasis and catalyzes the rate limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis 21.
PMC2764366	D01001	In contrast to other well known determinants of cholesterol homeostasis, e.g. LDL-receptor or Apolipoprotein E, associations between variants in HMGCR and LDL-C have only recently emerged in the context of GWAS.
PMC2764366	D01002	As in the Kosrae study, the initial results of the DGI GWAS in 2758 Caucasians supported associations between SNPs in HMGCR and LDL-C, but did not meet the statistical threshold of genome-wide significance by themselves (best associated SNP rs12654264: p=4.09×10−4) 13.
PMC2764366	D01003	In this study, genome-wide significance was clearly established for HMGCR SNP rs12654264 after validation in three additional Caucasian cohorts, resulting in a combined p-value of 1×10−20 in a total of ~18000 subjects 13.
PMC2764366	D01004	However in a separate study, the associations between SNPs in HMGCR and LDL-C that were observed in the DGI study were not strengthened by a meta analysis approach, consisting of the DGI and two other Caucasian GWAS (best associated SNP rs3846663: p=2.79×10−4 ) 12.
PMC2764366	D02000	A major aspect of our study was to follow-up the findings from the GWAS and to identify the putative functional variant at the HMGCR locus.
PMC2764366	D02005	On the other hand, we provide mutually supportive evidence that a common intronic variant (rs3846662) in LD with the genotyped variants is functional and alters the efficiency of HMGCR exon13 alternative splicing: We could demonstrate that (1.) expression levels of alternatively spliced Δexon13 HMGCR mRNA were significantly lower in lymphoblastoid cells from homozygotes for the rs3846662 minor allele and (2.) allele status at rs3846662 directly modulated alternative splicing of HMGCR mRNA in minigene constructs.
PMC2764366	D02006	Further, alternative splicing of HMGCR appeared to be regulated and was present in vivo, as we could detect Δexon13 HMGCR mRNA in all eleven human tissues that we studied.
PMC2764366	D03000	HMGCR mRNA lacking exon13 was described in a survey of alternative pre-mRNA splicing by Johnson et al 20, however its function and the underlying mechanisms remain unknown.
PMC2764366	D04000	Modulation of alternatively spliced HMGCR mRNA levels could be of pharmacologic interest with regard to response to statin therapy or as target for antisense-mediated exon skipping.
PMC2764366	D05000	Therefore, identification of specific factors that regulate HMGCR alternative splicing and elucidating the underlying mechanism may lead to a better understanding of its impact on regulating cellular cholesterol homeostasis and plasma cholesterol levels.
PMC2764366	I04000	In this manuscript, we report associations of SNPs in HMGCR with LDL-C in Kosraens that, in combination with similar findings from studies in Caucasians, indicate that the same genetic variants at HMGCR contribute to differences in LDL-C across populations.
PMC2764366	I04001	To follow-up the association signal, we have implemented a hypothesis driven strategy and performed in vitro studies to identify a functional variant in intron13 of HMGCR that affects alternative splicing of exon13.

PMC2764366	M06000	Minigenes were used to assess the influence of SNP rs3846662 on alternative splicing of HMGCR exon13.
PMC2764366	M07000	HEK293 cells were transfected with HMGCR pSPL3 minigenes (A, G and A→G) and empty pSPL3 vector (negative control) using FuGene6 reagent (Roche Applied Bioscience).

PMC2764366	M07002	HMGCR splicing pattern was analyzed by Real-Time PCR as described above.
PMC2764366	M08000	The open reading frames of HMGCR full-length and Δexon13 mRNA were PCR amplified and cloned into the pcDNA3.1 expression vector (Invitrogen).
PMC2764366	M08001	UT-2 cells with stable expression of human full-length (UT-2+FL) or Δexon13 HMGCR (UT-2+ex13) were generated by G418 selection of FuGene6 transfected UT-2cells.
PMC2764366	M09001	HMG-CoA reductase activity was measured in detergent solubilized cell extracts as described 17 except that mevalonolactone was separated by ion exchange chromatography 18.
PMC2764366	R02000	Combining p-values across both studies, we validated multiple SNPs at the HMGCR locus, three of which surpassed a genome-wide significance of p<5 ×10−8 (rs7703051, rs12654264 and rs3846663) (Table 1 and supplemental Fig.II).
PMC2764366	R02001	A regional association plot for the combined results showed a peak of association signal over a 47 kb region containing the HMGCR gene (Fig.II).
PMC2764366	R03000	We also combined the p-values of the association analysis results for plasma total cholesterol from the Kosrae and DGI studies and found genome-wide significance for the same three SNPs at the HMGCR locus (supplemental Table I).
PMC2764366	R04000	To follow-up the association results, we next aimed to discover functional variants at the HMGCR locus and study their molecular mode of action.
PMC2764366	R04001	We used existing resequencing data of the region containing the entire HMGCR gene from 23 Caucasians - estimated to have >99% power to detect variants with a minor allele frequency of >5% 19- to identify candidate functional SNPs.
PMC2764366	R04002	Under our hypothesis driven model we focused on SNPs that would have strong potential for changing HMGCR function or levels.
PMC2764366	R05003	We detected that SNP rs3846662 was located 47bp downstream of exon13 and in LD with the genotyped variants of genome-wide significance (r2:0.82–0.93, Fig.1).We hypothesized that this intronic SNP may be functional and modulate the splicing efficiency of exon13.
PMC2764366	R06000	To analyze whether rs3846662 was associated with HMGCR splicing efficiency we obtained lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) from Caucasian CEU individuals of the HapMap collection, who were either homozygous for the major (rs3846662/AA) or minor allele (rs3846662/GG).
PMC2764366	R07000	We went on to determine the amounts of full-length and alternatively spliced HMGCR (Δexon13) mRNA separately.
PMC2764366	R07001	Δexon13 HMGCR mRNA was detectable in all samples and showed significant variation along the time course (Fig.2B).
PMC2764366	R07002	We observed a distinct decrease in the percentage of Δexon13 HMGCR mRNA in both genotype groups over the first 10h.
PMC2764366	R07003	However, the decrease in percentage of Δexon13 HMGCR mRNA was significantly less pronounced in LCLs from homozygotes for the rs3846662 major allele.
PMC2764366	R07004	Hence, the percentage of Δexon13 HMGCR mRNA per total HMGCR mRNA was significantly higher in homozygotes for the major allele as compared to homozygotes for the minor allele at 10h, 24h and 48h (10h: 23.0±7.6 vs. 10.4±3.4, 24h: 23.1±7.9 vs. 11.6±3.8, 48h: 27.1±9.4 vs. 15.7±9.1, % Δexon13/total HMGCR mRNA, major vs. minor allele, Fig.2B).
PMC2764366	R09000	We next quantified the expression levels of both HMGCR transcripts in vivo, using cDNA samples from various human tissues.
PMC2764366	R10000	Our studies in LCLs demonstrated that the amount of Δexon13 HMGCR mRNA was associated with allele status at SNP rs3846662.
PMC2764366	R10002	We created exon-trapping vectors containing the genomic DNA sequence of HMGCR from intron12 to intron14 of rs3846662/AA (major allele) and rs3846662/GG (minor allele) individuals, respectively and transfected them into HEK293 cells.
PMC2764366	R11000	In accordance with our previous results in human LCLs, we found significantly lower levels for Δexon13 HMGCR mRNA in cells transfected with the minor allele minigene (rs3846662/G) as compared to cells transfected with the major allele minigene (rs3846662/A) (Fig.4).
PMC2764366	R11001	The difference in exon13 splicing efficiency between the two minigenes was 20.8% (42.9±3.9 vs. 63.7±1.0 %Δexon13 HMGCR mRNA/total HMGCR mRNA, p=0.02).
PMC2764366	R11002	This difference in splicing efficiency was abolished when we transfected a construct in which we had used site directed mutagenesis to convert rs3846662/A to the minor G allele (Fig.4), further corroborating that allelic variants at rs3846662 directly modulate the efficiency of HMGCR exon13 splicing.
PMC2764366	R12000	Alternative splicing of HMGCR mRNA leads to an in-frame deletion of 53 amino acids in the catalytic domain of the protein.
PMC2764366	R12001	To investigate the effect of this deletion on enzyme activity, we stably expressed human full-length (UT-2+FL) and Δexon13 (UT-2+ex13) HMGCR variants at comparable levels in UT-2 cells (Fig.5A), a CHO cell-line that lacks HMGCR activity and requires exogenous mevalonate for growth 16.
PMC2764366	R12002	UT-2+FL cells displayed 51% HMGCR enzyme activity of wild-type CHO cells, whereas UT-2+ex13 cells lacked enzyme activity and were indistinguishable from control UT-2 cells (Fig.5B).
PMC2764366	R12003	Further, UT-2+FL cells grew in the absence of mevalonate, whereas UT-2+ex13 and parental UT-2 cells died without mevalonate supplementation (Fig.5C), suggesting that the Δexon13 HMGCR variant is unable to restore enzyme activity in these cells.

PMC2797209	D04000	The excretion of the protease in the mite feces would be expected to allow the protease access to the proteins found in the epidermal layer.
PMC2797209	D04001	As proteins in house dust mite feces have been found to gain considerable access to lung tissue of allergy sufferers (35), it is similarly likely that the protease in the mite fecal matter might gain such access to skin.
PMC2797209	D04002	The actions of this protease would be anticipated to cause considerable disruption to the proper assembly and structure of the epidermal layer.
PMC2797209	D04004	Disruption of the structure of this protein, which has been shown here to be a substrate of the Sar s 3 protease, would be expected to substantially disrupt the CE, and indeed such disruption of the epidermis is commonly observed in sufferers of scabies mite infestations.

PMC2797209	R00001	Testing of the antibodies using immunoblotting analysis revealed that the antibodies against rSar s 3 were specific to the enzyme and did not cross-react with scabies mite-inactivated protease paralogues from the scabies mite (data not shown).

PMC2862965	R03001	Relatively little is known about GSTCD, but the presence of the C-terminal α-helical domain common to the glutathione S-transferase (GST) family of enzymes suggests this protein is involved in cellular detoxification by catalyzing conjugation of glutathione to products of oxidative stress14.

PMC3088509	D00000	In this study, we have identified PGD2S as a candidate biomarker for pediatric medulloblastoma after studying the extent of variability that exists in the CSF proteome.
PMC3088509	D01000	The most intriguing finding in our study is the alteration of prostaglandin D2 synthase isoforms (PGD2S), a glycoprotein that is abundant in CSF.
PMC3088509	D01001	PGD2S, also known as β- trace, is one of the most abundant glycoprotein in human CSF [30]; it is synthesized and secreted by both glial cells and the choroid plexus [31].
PMC3088509	D01013	Therefore, we quantitated levels of PGD2 in our CSF samples using ELISA but found no correlation to PGD2S quantities in CSF samples from tumor and control subjects (data not shown) most likely due to its instability in biological fluids and rapid degradation to the 15-deoxy prostaglandin J2 metabolite [37].
PMC3088509	D02004	This observation could suggest that either these spots are sensitive enough to indicate the presence of minimal residual disease after surgical removal of the tumor or that the turnover of PGD2S in the CSF requires more than 2 weeks.
PMC3088509	D03000	Because neither age, histological subtype, effect of surgery nor presence of metastases correlated with the intensity of the PGD2S spots, the observed alteration in PGD2S was not attributed to any factor other than disease status.
PMC3088509	D03001	Furthermore, the consideration of blood contamination was rendered moot by the fact that PGD2S is a protein.
PMC3088509	D04000	In addition to the decrease in total PGD2S levels, there was a marked difference in the levels of various isoforms between patients and controls.
PMC3088509	D04001	In particular, there was at least a 2 fold reduction of the acidic isoforms of PGD2S in medulloblastoma samples (see Table 1).
PMC3088509	D04002	This prompted us to identify the glycosylation patterns in the various isoforms of PGD2S. Since the linear MS spectra for all three spots exhibited pairs of peaks with masses of 4163 and 3870 as well as 3960 and 3667, which differ in mass by 292 Da (the mass of a sialic acid molecule), we hypothesized that all three spots contained sialylated glycopeptides but different number of sialic molecules.
PMC3088509	D04003	This was confirmed by neuraminidase treatment (see Figure 3).
PMC3088509	D04004	We were able to detect only two of the three predicted glycopeptides from PGD2S, one spanning amino acid sequence 67 to 86 and the other starting at 87 and ending at 92.
PMC3088509	D04005	We speculate that these PGD2S isoforms are a result of differential glycosylation patterns of the three predicted sites in the protein.
PMC3088509	D04006	Further analysis of purified PGD2S using accurate mass measurements is required to fully characterize its glycosylation pattern in CSF but such an analysis is beyond the scope of this clinical study.
PMC3088509	D04007	In conclusion, the observations described herein indicate that PGD2S is a CSF biomarker for medulloblastoma, which could be useful in detecting the efficacy of treatment and the recurrence of disease.
PMC3088509	M02000	PGD2S protein spots were excised from the 2-DE gel in-gel tryptic proteolysis was carried out.
PMC3088509	M03000	PGD2S measurements in CSF were performed using commercially available ELISA kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol (Cayman Chemicals, Ann Arbor, MI).
PMC3088509	R04000	Three proteins, namely apolipoprotein E (apo E), apolipoprotein J (apo J) and prostaglandin D2 synthase (PGD2S) were differentially expressed in the CSF of medulloblastoma patients (see Figure 1 and Table 1).
PMC3088509	R06000	To study the effect of the presence of gross tumor in the alteration of PGD2S levels, the medulloblastoma samples were divided into two groups-one in which the tumor was totally resected and CSF samples collected by lumbar puncture (LP) 10–14 days after surgery and a second group consisting of samples collected at a time where the tumor was still present (not totally resected, or with metastatic disease, or ventricular CSF obtained at the time of surgery).
PMC3088509	R06001	There was no difference in the PGD2S spot intensities between the two groups (see supporting information).
PMC3088509	R07000	To validate decreased PGD2S levels as a biomarker for medulloblastoma in CSF, we used a commercially available sandwich ELISA kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) to measure PGD2S levels in the same cohort.
PMC3088509	R07001	The ELISA assay using 17 medulloblastoma and 10 control samples corroborated the 2-DE finding showing a 7.9 fold reduction in total PGD2S in tumor samples after normalizing the values to total protein concentration (p<0.000002) (Figure 2).
PMC3088509	R08000	We detected 7 isoforms of PGD2S in our 2-DE gels with a spot pattern that is characteristic of glycosylation (Figure 1).

PMC3108835	D00000	The major findings of this study were the following: (i) associations between SLE and several new and previously reported autoantigens/autoantibodies were demonstrated using multiple proteomic analyses: two-dimensional-PAGE/WB/MALDI-TOF/MS analysis and immunoprecipitation followed by LC-MS/MS shotgun analysis; and (ii) statistically significant associations between anti-esterase D antibodies and CNS syndromes as well as between anti-APEX nuclease 1 antibodies and psychiatric disorders in SLE were also shown by ELISAs, although the associations of other autoantibodies with CNS syndromes were unexpectedly unclear.
PMC3108835	D01000	We found new, previously unreported associations of three serum autoantibodies with SLE, demonstrating reactivity against crystallin αB, esterase D, and APEX nuclease 1.
PMC3108835	D03000	Statistically significant associations between anti-esterase D antibodies and CNS syndromes as well as between anti-APEX nuclease 1 antibodies and psychiatric disorders in SLE were also demonstrated for the first time.
PMC3108835	D03001	However, although promising, these novel findings require cautious interpretation and further investigation to allow for decisive conclusions because most of the O.D. values of anti-esterase D antibodies in the present study were not very high and there were several samples from patients without psychiatric disorders that had high-titer anti-APEX1 antibodies and vice versa.
PMC3108835	D06001	Among them, statistically significant associations between anti-esterase D antibodies and CNS syndromes as well as between anti-APEX nuclease 1 antibodies and psychiatric disorders in SLE were also shown.
PMC3108835	D06002	This study demonstrates that the immunoproteomic approach used in this study combining two-dimensional-PAGE/WB/MALDI-TOF/MS analysis and immunoprecipitation followed by LC-MS/MS shotgun analysis is a reliable and effective method for the identification of autoantigens in SLE.
PMC3108835	R02000	Differentially reacted protein spots specific to the CNS group were excised from the blotted membranes and subjected to digestion with lysine endopeptidase, followed by peptide-mass fingerprinting and MALDI-TOF/MS.
PMC3108835	R05000	Although some of the proteomic data (e.g. esterase D) were insufficient for protein identification by themselves (supplemental data), we selected possible antigens based on not only the results of the two proteomic approaches described above but also literature information.
PMC3108835	R05001	Among the many candidate antigens screened, 11 recombinant antigens showed positive reactions against the pooled sera of 28 patients with active CNS lupus by WB analysis: crystallin αB, esterase D, APEX nuclease 1, 60S acidic ribosomal protein P0 (ribosomal protein P0), proteasome activator complex subunit 3 (PA28γ), triosephosphate isomerase, phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (cell migration-inducing gene 10 protein), phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1, phosphoglycerate mutase 1, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type-2, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (Fig. 2).
PMC3108835	R05002	Among these, APEX nuclease 1, PA28γ, phosphoglycerate mutase 1, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase type-2, and glial fibrillary acidic protein were identified exclusively by immunoprecipitation followed by LC-MS/MS shotgun analysis.
PMC3108835	R07000	The O.D. values of sera from the CNS group were significantly higher than those from the non-CNS group in ELISAs using esterase D (p = 0.016), although most of them show low O.D. values (< 0.1; Fig. 5A).
PMC3108835	R07001	Unexpectedly, no O.D. values in ELISAs of other autoantibodies differed significantly between SLE patients with or without active CNS syndromes when tested in larger sample sizes: crystallin αB (p = 0.75), APEX nuclease 1 (p = 0.18), ribosomal protein P0 (p = 0.89), or PA28γ (p = 0.58).
PMC3108835	R07002	However, when the CNS group with neurologic disorders and the CNS group with psychiatric disorders were separately compared with SLE patients without those disorders, the levels of anti-APEX nuclease 1 antibodies were significantly elevated in SLE patients with psychiatric disorders compared with the levels in SLE patients without psychiatric disorders (p = 0.037;

PMC3108838	R06000	Essentially identical results were obtained in an experiment in which the AP and BG peptides were spiked into the RKO lysate following reduction and alkylation, but prior to addition of trypsin (not shown).
PMC3108838	R06001	We also obtained similar results in experiments in which the RKO lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and gel bands were excised and spiked with the AP or BG peptides and labeled standards either prior to or following in-gel tryptic digestion (not shown).

PMC3208743	D06002	The increase in ChoCC has been associated with progressive alteration of membrane choline phospholipid metabolism during malignant transformation.62 It has been reported that the activity of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PLC) and phospholipase D (PLD), the enzymes responsible for the degradation of phosphatidylcholine was higher in human mammary epithelial and epithelial ovarian carcinoma cell lines.62, 63 These findings suggest that both biosynthetic and catabolic pathways of the phosphatidylcholine cycle contribute to the accumulation of ChoCC in tumor tissues.

PMC3214617	I10000	SNP rs10811661 near cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors CDKN2A and CDKN2B showed modest evidence for T2D association in our stage 1 + 2 sample (OR = 1.20, P = 0.0022) (Table 1 and table S5) and showed genome-wide significance in the all-data meta-analysis (OR = 1.20, P = 7.8 × 10−15).
PMC3221604	D04000	In order to assess the prevalence of prophages in H. pylori, we performed a PCR screen for the integrase gene and found this gene in a surprisingly high proportion of screened isolates (21.4%, 73/341).
PMC3221604	D09002	It is possible that they shape the genome at least in terms of the diversity of strains found worldwide as well as contributing to virulence evolution.
PMC3221604	M02000	Genomic DNA from the B45 strain was extracted from cultures originating from a single colony, by using a commercial kit (Qiagen SA, Courtaboeuf, France) including an RNase step.
PMC3221604	M13000	To identify the prevalence of prophage sequences in H. pylori strains, a PCR screening strategy was used with degenerated primers F1, AAGYTTTTTAGMGTTTTGYG, and R1, CGCCCTGGCTTAGCATC, designed using Primer 3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/) on the aligned integrase sequences of B38 (HELPY_1521), B45, and H. acinonychis strain Sheeba (Hac_1606) obtained using multiple sequence alignment with hierarchical clustering (71).
PMC3221604	M14000	Phylogeny analysis was performed on the integrase sequences obtained on the 73 positive strains screened in the present study: a 442-bp sequence was available for each sequenced PCR product.
PMC3221604	M14001	We also included the internal fragment of the Hac_1606 integrase sequence (YP_665314.1|) corresponding to the amplified product.
PMC3221604	M15000	The evolutionary history of phage integrase genes was inferred using the neighbor-joining method.
PMC3221604	R10000	In order to estimate the prevalence of this prophage type in H. pylori genomes, we screened 341 strains, isolated in different geographic regions and from patients presenting different pathologies, using degenerate PCR primers targeting the B38, B45, and H. acinonychis strain Sheeba prophage II integrase genes.
PMC3221604	R10001	Surprisingly, 21.4% of the isolates (73/341) had an integrase gene (GenBank accession numbers JF734912 to JF734984), suggesting that this is a much more frequent phenomenon than initially estimated.
PMC3221604	R11003	Interestingly, the first one (cluster A), which included the B45 integrase, was comprised of 81.0% (17/21) French isolates and the second (cluster B) was composed of 70.6% (12/17) Swedish isolates.
PMC3221604	R11004	The H. acinonychis strain Sheeba prophage II integrase formed a sister group with these two clusters.
PMC3221604	R11007	The last cluster (cluster D), found at the extremity of the second branch, was more heterogeneous in geographic composition and was comprised of 6 French, 4 German, 3 Portuguese, and 3 Swedish strains.
PMC3224994	D01000	The strongest association signal (P = 2.12 10−6) in the combined analysis was found with marker rs7045881 × located in the first intron of the PLAA gene on 9p21, encoding phospholipase A2-activating protein (PLAP).
PMC3224994	D04001	The polymorphism rs4316429 within the glutamate dehydrogenase pseudogene 5 (GLUDP5) on 10p11 shows nominal association (P = 3.59 × 10−2) in the replication analysis and in the combined analysis (P = 1.90 × 10−5).
PMC3241912	D03000	Muglia and colleagues (2008) reported that the protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor PTPRN was significantly associated with major depression: in the current report, two other protein tyrosine phosphatase receptors, PTPRD and PTPRS, are significantly associated with the comorbid phenotype.
PMC3249587	M02001	PCR was performed using 50 ng of genomic DNA, Taq DNA polymerase (EF Taq, SolGent, Daejeon, Korea), and 0.5 pM of each primer under the following conditions: 30 cycles of PCR consisting of denaturation for 10 s at 98℃, annealing for 30 s at 65℃, extension for 2 min at 72℃, and a final extension for 10 min at 72℃ in a thermocycler (Gene Amp PCR system 9700, Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA).
PMC3249587	M05000	The fragment encompassing the promoter region of APOM, -1747 to +55, was amplified with primers containing restriction endonuclease sites.
PMC3254127	M03000	Bacterial pellets collected from dental plaque and saliva were suspended in lysis buffer with lysozyme (20 mg/ml) and incubated with proteinase K. Bacterial DNA was extracted using QIAamp DNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions.
PMC3254127	M04000	The amplification mix contained 12.5 ul of Gotaq Hotstart polymerase 2 × mix (Promega, USA), a 1 ul of each primer (5 pM), 1 ul genomic DNA (0.1-10 ng μl-1) and 9.5 ul H2O in a total volume of 25 μl.
PMC3255724	R03000	Growth was also detected for most F. prausnitzii strains on the host-derived sugar N-acetylglucosamine and for some strains on d-glucosamine and d-glucuronic acid, while β-glucuronidase activity has been reported previously in some F. prausnitzii isolates (8).
PMC3258399	R18001	In the absence of medium chain acyl-CoA dehydroxygenase (MCAD) phenylpropionacid is converted to phenylpropionglycine instead of benzoic acid.
PMC3258399	R18002	Phenylpropionglycine is detected only in the urine of MCAD-deficient patients and has been used as a biomarker for the diagnosis of this condition (Wikoff 2009).
PMC3260972	R06000	In the GWAS approach, the best associated SNP rs11143230 was located in the vicinity of GDA.
PMC3260972	R06001	We analyzed 68 SNPs (rs11143230 was not genotyped) within GDA in our discovery sample.
PMC3276286	A00000	Serum gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) activity is a marker of liver disease which is also prospectively associated with the risk of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and cancers.
PMC3276286	A00001	We have discovered novel loci affecting GGT in a genome-wide association study (rs1497406 in an intergenic region of chromosome 1, P = 3.9 × 10−8; rs944002 in C14orf73 on chromosome 14, P = 4.7 × 10−13; rs340005 in RORA on chromosome 15, P = 2.4 × 10−8), and a highly significant heterogeneity between adult and adolescent results at the GGT1 locus on chromosome 22 (maximum PHET = 5.6 × 10−12 at rs6519520).
PMC3276286	A00002	Pathway analysis of significant and suggestive single-nucleotide polymorphism associations showed significant overlap between genes affecting GGT and those affecting common metabolic and inflammatory diseases, and identified the hepatic nuclear factor (HNF) family as controllers of a network of genes affecting GGT.
PMC3276286	A00003	Our results reinforce the disease associations of GGT and demonstrate that control by the GGT1 locus varies with age.
PMC3276286	D00001	First, GGT activity has been shown in many prospective studies to have important disease associations, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.
PMC3276286	D01000	We replicated previously reported associations between GGT activity and SNPs in GGT1 and HNF1A. These are discussed in more detail, in relation to the age heterogeneity and the network analysis, below.
PMC3276286	D02000	Of the novel loci, that on chromosome 1 is intergenic, between EPHA2 and ARHGEF19, and shows some linkage disequilibrium with each, but neither gene shows obvious connections with GGT.
PMC3276286	D05000	SNPs in and near GGT1 are known to be associated with serum GGT activity (6–8), but the age effect means that this relationship is more complex than previously thought.
PMC3276286	D05001	This interaction is an unexpected result, although we have previously found evidence from a longitudinal twin study that genetic effects on GGT activity differ with age across adolescence (15).
PMC3276286	D05002	GGT activity is known to change with age and also differs between men and women; in our data, the sex difference becomes apparent at about age 14 and there is a substantial increase in mean GGT between the ages of 18 and 30 (see Supplementary Material, Table S4).
PMC3276286	D05003	Similar differences between mean GGT in adolescents and adults were present in the replication cohorts.
PMC3276286	D05006	As for other biochemical phenotypes which change with age, existing knowledge does little more than describe the changes which occur and the mechanisms are poorly understood, but the existence of age-by-genotype effects for serum GGT adds to the complexity and emphasizes genetic causes of differences between people.
PMC3276286	D07000	Out of the GGT and GGT-related gene family, only GGT1 has been shown to produce an active enzyme (21), although GGT protein, GGT1 transcripts and other GGT genes have physiological functions independent of enzymatic activity (22,23).
PMC3276286	D09000	Although only five loci met genome-wide significance criteria for GGT, many other variants with smaller effect sizes or lower minor-allele frequencies (MAFs) must contribute to the heritability of this phenotype.
PMC3276286	D10000	This pathway analysis also showed networks of genes in which variation is associated with GGT activity, connected by previously documented effects (mainly effects of one gene product on the expression of another gene).
PMC3276286	D10001	Figure 3 emphasizes the existence of a group of genes whose variation affects GGT activity and which are controlled by or connected with the Hepatic Nuclear Factor family.
PMC3276286	D10002	Multiple genes, which are controlled by HNF1a, HNF4a or both, contain SNPs which are associated with GGT activity at P < 0.001, and SNPs in both HNF4A and (even more strongly)
PMC3276286	D10003	HNF1A have apparently direct effects on GGT.
PMC3276286	D10004	This reinforces the phenotypic associations between serum GGT and obesity and inflammation, while the SNP-disease associations are consistent with the predictive validity of serum GGT for diabetes, cardiovascular disease and overall mortality.
PMC3276286	D12000	Serum GGT activity is an independent predictor of morbidity and mortality, and increases in obesity and metabolic syndrome.
PMC3276286	D12001	These associations are strengthened by our discovery that SNPs affecting GGT, even at suggestive rather than genome-wide-significant levels, include a highly significant excess of those affecting cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
PMC3276286	D12002	The direction of association between SNPs at the GGT1 locus (and potentially elsewhere) and serum GGT activity changes with age, and differences in allelic effects on GGT between health and disease deserve further study.
PMC3276286	I00000	Gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) is a membrane-bound enzyme which transfers glutamyl groups linked through the gamma-carboxylic acid from peptides such as glutathione to acceptors.
PMC3276286	I01000	Measurement of GGT activity in serum is used clinically as a liver function test and a biomarker for excessive alcohol consumption (2), but there is also strong evidence of prospective associations between GGT activity and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and cancers.
PMC3276286	I01001	For example, a study of >0.25 million people followed for a median of 7.6 years (3) showed a relative risk of death from any cause of 2.0 when the top 15% of participants were compared against the bottom 37% for GGT at entry.
PMC3276286	I02000	Given this biological and epidemiological information about GGT, identification of polymorphisms, genes and pathways influencing serum GGT should contribute to our understanding of the response to oxidative stress and the causes of cardiovascular and metabolic risk.
PMC3276286	I02004	Apart from the known association with GGT, there are associations with serum C-reactive protein (CRP) (9), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and coronary artery disease (10) and type 2 diabetes (11).
PMC3276286	I03000	As with many quantitative traits, the heritability of serum GGT activity [50–60% in adults (13,14)] is substantially greater than can be accounted for by identified and significant SNP associations.
PMC3276286	I03001	We previously found heritability for GGT of ∼70% in adolescents (15), with evidence for some genetic effects common to ages 12, 14 and 16 and others which change with age.
PMC3276286	I03002	There is also evidence for genetic correlation between serum GGT, ALT and AST activity (13).
PMC3276286	I04000	We have conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for serum GGT activity in 12 526 adults and adolescents.
PMC3276286	I04001	Our aims were to identify novel loci, test whether they affect other markers of liver function (ALT, AST) or only GGT, and compare allelic effects between adults and adolescents.
PMC3276286	I04002	Using both significant and suggestive SNP associations, we searched for overlap between genes or pathways affecting GGT and those affecting cardiovascular or diabetic risk.
PMC3276286	M05000	From the combined Adult Studies, 17 071 people had GGT and other liver enzyme results, some from more than one study.
PMC3276286	M09001	For the 1993–96 Adult Study, GGT, ALT, AST, lipids and glucose were measured with standard clinical laboratory methods on a Hitachi 747 analyser.
PMC3276286	M17001	Serum GGT was analysed on an Architect c16000 Analyser (Abbott Diagnostics, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL 60064, USA) using reagents from Abbott Diagnostics.
PMC3276286	M17003	Of the 2868 individuals who participated in the childhood follow-ups, 1377 individuals had GGT levels measured at the 14-year follow-up and 1268 at the 17-year follow-up.
PMC3276286	M17004	A subset of those individuals were selected for analysis based on singleton birth, having no siblings in the study, Caucasian ethnicity, no congenital abnormalities and relevant genotype data.
PMC3276286	M19000	We submitted all SNPs showing associations with GGT at P < 0.001
PMC3276286	R00000	We tested for SNP associations of serum GGT activity in two Australian cohorts, of adults and adolescents, and compared the adolescent results with the larger adult data set for replication and heterogeneity testing.
PMC3276286	R01000	Five genome-wide-significant associations (P < 5 × 10−8) were found for GGT in either the adult or the combined adult and adolescent data (Table 1).
PMC3276286	R02000	We compared results for additional liver function tests, ALT and AST.
PMC3276286	R02001	There was no overlap between our genome-wide-significant results for GGT and nominally significant results for ALT or AST, or vice versa.
PMC3276286	R02002	An intergenic region on chromosome 7 showed suggestive effects on all three enzyme activities, with a block of SNPs showing lowest P-values of 1.3 × 10−6 for GGT, 8.3 × 10−5 for ALT and 1.2 × 10−6 for AST (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2).
PMC3276286	R02003	The reported association for AST on chromosome 10, in MRC1/MRC1L1 (8), was confirmed (rs691461, P = 7.3 × 10−15), and that between ALT and PNPLA3 (7) showed P =
PMC3276286	R02005	In view of the associations between GGT activity and cardiometabolic risk factors, we also tested whether the SNPs showing significant associations with GGT had effects on BMI, lipids, glucose and CRP.
PMC3276286	R05000	There was substantial overlap between genes containing significant or suggestive SNPs for GGT and genes showing documented disease associations.
PMC3276286	R05001	For 321 genes identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis from the list of SNPs with P < 0.001 for GGT, an excess of disease associations was found for the categories ‘coronary artery disease’, ‘hypertension’, ‘non-insulin-dependent diabetes’, ‘insulin-dependent diabetes’, ‘rheumatoid arthritis’, ‘Crohn's disease’, ‘inflammatory bowel disease’, ‘progressive motor neuropathy’ and ‘amyotrophic lateral sclerosis’, all at P < 10−10 (by Fisher's exact test).
PMC3278245	I01001	In the cyclooxygenase pathway, arachidonic acid is converted into various bioactive lipid molecules including prostaglandin E2 (8).
PMC3302576	A00001	Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified numerous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) and a Dopamine Beta-Hydroxylase (DBH) locus associated with smoking cessation in multiple populations.
PMC3302576	A04001	Associations of CHRNA3/CHRNA5 and CYP2A6 loci with CPD and DBH with smoking cessation are also likely of importance in the smoking behaviors of COPD patients.
PMC3302576	D06000	Analysis of smoking cessation did not reveal any loci associated below the suggestive significance level, and it showed that the previously reported 10 association between rs3025343 in the DBH locus can be replicated in COPD subjects with a nominal significance threshold.
PMC3302576	D06001	DBH is a plausible candidate gene for smoking cessation since it participates in the metabolism of dopamine.
PMC3334304	D02000	Of the genes implicated here in wheezing and influenza acquisition, it is interesting to note that two are myosin-related genes: MYLK (associated here with acquisition of natural influenza) and MYH14 (associated here with wheezing post-vaccination).
PMC3334304	D02001	MYLK is a nonmuscle myosin light chain kinase isoform involved in inflammatory response and MYLK genetic variants have been implicated in susceptibility to sepsis-induced acute lung injury and asthma38–40.

PMC3346154	M16002	Plasmids with cDNAs for retinoic acid receptors α, β, and γ were cotransfected in individual experiments.
PMC3346154	M16003	Four hours after transfection, cells were treated with test compounds that were dissolved in ethanol or with 0.1% ethanol alone for an additional 24 h. Cell lysates were then assayed for luciferase activities using a GloMax 96 microplate luminometer (Promega) and the Dual-Luciferase reporter assay system (Promega).
PMC3346154	M16004	For each experiment, the firefly luciferase activity (experimental reporter) was normalized to Renilla luciferase (control reporter) activity.
PMC3346154	M16005	The change in normalized firefly luciferase activity was calculated relative to that for cells that were transfected with vehicle (ethanol), which was set as 1.
PMC3346154	R01000	We first screened all of the compounds for their potential to activate RARα, RARβ, and RARγ, using Cos-1 cells transiently transfected with cDNAs for the individual RARs and with a RARE-luciferase reporter.
PMC3356921	I01000	Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have reported genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across a 70-kilobase (kb) region that includes APOE and several neighboring genes,5 namely, poliovirus receptor–related 2 (PVRL2 [OMIM *600798]), translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 yeast homologue (TOMM40

PMC3406255	D02000	The 13C labeling pattern in glucose, [U-13C]glucose, was chosen over alternatives because the intent was to achieve maximal enrichment of the pyruvate pool to increase the likelihood of detecting flux through PDH.
PMC3406255	D05003	This specific conclusion relies solely on qualitative analysis of the 13C NMR spectra, and does not require any assumptions or mathematical modeling.
PMC3419811	D00001	ABO encodes for glycosyltransferases responsible for post translational glycosylation of procoagulant FVIII and von Willebrand Factor (VWF).[23] ABO O blood group phenotype and genotype (i.e., ABO rs8176719) is associated with a decreased risk for VTE,[7, 8, 24] presumably due to decreased plasma levels of FVIII and VWF.[25, 26] ABO-mediated glycosylation protects VWF from proteolysis by ADAMTS13[27] such that individuals with type O blood group (homozygous exon 6 ABO rs8176719 deletion) and hypoglycosylated VWF have ~25% lower plasma FVIII and VWF levels.[24, 28]

PMC3505013	I00001	Inhibition of the EGFR pathway with tyrosine kinaseinhibitors (TKIs), such as erlotinib in patients with advanced NSCLC, leads to improvedsurvival compared with placebo (Shepherd et al,2005).
PMC3544159	D01001	In the first approach, SA samples modified with metabolites of PhIP were enzymatically digested with a mixture of Pronase E, leucine aminopeptidase, and prolidase, to produce amino acid containing adducts.37,38 Data-dependent scanning of NO2-PhIP-modified SA revealed that adducts were formed with Cys, Lys, and Tyr.
PMC3544159	M10000	Trypsin/chymotrypsin digestion: The denatured and alkylated PhIP-modified SA (5 μg, 75 pmol, in 35 μL 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) containing CaCl2 (1 mM) was digested with trypsin at a protease:protein ratio of 1:50 (w/w) and chymotrypsin at a protease:SA ratio of 1:12.5 (w/w).
PMC3544159	M11000	Pronase E/leucine aminopeptidase/prolidase digestion: This enzymatic digestion was performed as described previously.24 In brief, the PhIP-modified SA (5 μg, 75 pmol) in 50 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.5) containing 1 mM MnCl2 was treated with Pronase E at a protease:protein ratio of 1:2 (w/w), leucine aminopeptidase at a protease:protein ratio of 1:30 (w/w), and prolidase at a protease:SA ratio of 1:8 (w/w).
PMC3544159	R19001	The enzymatic digestion of HONH-PhIP- and HONH-[2H5]-PhIP-modified SA with Pronase E, leucine aminopeptidase, and prolidase resulted in extensive hydrolysis of the sulfinamide linkage, and targeted MS/MS analyses of the protein digest showed that PhIP was recovered in high yields.24
PMC3544159	R19002	The amino acid adduct N2-cysteinesulfinyl-PhIP was not detected in the 3-enzyme digest; however, data-dependent scanning identified two pairs of HONH-PhIP-tripeptide adducts (tR =17.8 and 19.3 min) (Supporting Information, Figure S-9, Table 3).
PMC3584211	D02000	This contention is corroborated by our observation that the protease mutant strain is more sensitive to AMPs.
PMC3584211	D02002	Herein, we show that extracellular proteases facilitate resistance to agents other than LL-37, as we observed increased sensitivity to both indolicidin and histatin-5.
PMC3584211	D03000	To further understand these findings, we performed FACS analyses using GFP-labeled variants of the wild-type and protease-null strain grown in human blood.
PMC3584211	D03001	After 4 h of incubation we observed increased phagocytosis of protease-null cells compared with the parental strain.
PMC3584211	D04000	We also observed significant influence of the secreted proteases on in vivo pathogenesis.
PMC3584211	D06000	In stark contrast to this, we in fact observe increased killing by the protease-null mutant when mortality was used as a measure of infection.
PMC3584211	D06001	This finding is of primary importance, and speaks strongly to a major role for the secreted proteases in controlling, and tightly regulating the infectious process.
PMC3584211	D06002	Herein, we show major increases in virulence-determinant stability upon inactivation of extracellular proteases.
PMC3584211	D06003	Specifically, we show that α-toxin, γ-hemolysin, PSMs, LukE, LukAB, PVL, and others are all more abundant in the protease-null strain.
PMC3584211	D07000	A major consideration with each of our phenotypic and growth-related studies is that the data presented may be skewed by elevated aggregation of the protease-null strain.
PMC3584211	D07001	It has previously been reported that secreted extracellular proteases have been shown to cleave surface and adhesive proteins by other groups (McGavin et al.
PMC3584211	D07003	Therefore it is reasonable to project that the protease-null strain may display elevated clumping compared with the parental strain, as we intimate above.
PMC3584211	D08000	Therefore, this presents a scenario where, in addition to their own, independent virulence-affecting roles, the secreted proteases exist as key check point enzymes to control the severity and intensity of infection via modulating the stability of other toxins and virulence determinants.
PMC3584211	D08001	Indeed, one could suggest that the regulatory control of secreted proteases by the agr system is no accident, but in fact evolutionary design.
PMC3584211	D09000	In summary, we demonstrate that the extracellular proteases of S. aureus play a variety of key roles in the virulence process.
PMC3584211	I02000	A number of studies have been conducted to determine the contribution of extracellular proteases to the disease process; however, many have been contradictory.
PMC3584211	I03000	In addition to these more general functions, S. aureus exoproteases have been shown to cleave specific host proteins.
PMC3584211	I03002	Secreted proteases can also cleave human α1-proteinase inhibitor (Potempa et al. 1986), the heavy chains of all human immunoglobulin classes (Prokesova et al. 1992), and elastin (Potempa et al. 1988), which aids in tissue invasion.
PMC3584211	I04000	Consequently, while there is a wealth of information on the role of secreted proteases in S. aureus disease causation, the specific role of these enzymes as virulence factors remains unclear.
PMC3584211	M00004	Once confirmed, this strain was used for the subsequent inactivation of sspAB, followed by scpA, using the pJB38 plasmids referred to above, and a protocol established for pKOR1 gene inactivation (Bae and Schneewind 2006).
PMC3584211	M05000	Phagocytosis of the wild-type and protease-null mutant was analyzed using pooled, whole human blood coupled with flow cytometry.
PMC3584211	M06000	Liquid cultures of LAC and its protease-null mutant were grown in Luria–Bertani (LB) media without NaCl.
PMC3584211	R00000	An extracellular protease-null strain of S. aureus has previously been generated and described in USA300 LAC (Wormann et al. 2011).
PMC3584211	R00001	As it forms the basis of the work described herein, we first set out to confirm the lack of secreted proteases in this strain using a targeted proteomics method.
PMC3584211	R01000	We first sought to assess whether loss of extracellular proteases affected viability of the USA300 LAC strain.
PMC3584211	R02000	We next set out to assess the fitness of the wild type and protease mutant during growth in a more pathogenically relevant medium, in this case pig serum.
PMC3584211	R03000	The specific mechanism by which the reduced viability of the protease-null strain in serum is mediated is unclear.
PMC3584211	R03007	Specifically, we observed a twofold decrease in protease-null cells compared with the parental strain at a concentration of 45 μg/mL, which increased to >fourfold at 65 μg/mL, and more than 7.5-fold at 85 μg/mL. Similar findings were observed with indolicidin, with a 2.5-fold decrease in viability observed for the mutant strain at 4 μg/mL, a more than sevenfold observed at 6 μg/mL, and >10-fold at 7 μg/mL. Finally, when these analyses were performed using histatin-5 we observed a >2.5-fold decrease in mutant viability at 3 μg/mL, a >8.5-fold at 5 μg/mL, and >11-fold at 6 μg/mL.
PMC3584211	R03008	Collectively, it is apparent that extracellular protease deletion results in heightened sensitivity of S. aureus cells to the effects of antimicrobial peptides; and that this observation is not limited to a single peptide example.
PMC3584211	R03009	As such, these findings strongly suggest that secreted proteases are a major mechanism by which S. aureus resists the toxic effects of AMPs.
PMC3584211	R04000	The in vitro AMP sensitivity assays suggest that extracellular proteases are important for survival during interaction with elements of the immune system.
PMC3584211	R04008	These strains were incubated under identical conditions to the whole human blood survival assay, before white blood cells were isolated and subjected to separation and analysis by FACS (Fig. 3).
PMC3584211	R05000	There are conflicting results regarding the role of extracellular proteases in S. aureus virulence (Coulter et al. 1998;
PMC3584211	R05005	Accordingly, 10 mice were subcutaneously inoculated with either the LAC wild type or protease-null mutant, and the infection was allowed to proceed for 6 days.
PMC3584211	R08008	Other well-known virulence determinants were also found to be more abundant in the protease-null strain, including two Lipases (Geh = 3.8-fold, SAUSA300_2603 = 2.5-fold), components of the γ-hemolysin (HlgA = 2.4-fold, HlgC = 2.1-fold), α-toxin (twofold), leukotoxin LukE (twofold), and enterotoxin Q (1.5-fold).
PMC3584211	R08009	Our analysis also revealed increased abundance of certain proteins in the wild-type strain, including all 10 secreted proteases, as expected, along with catalase (ninefold), the CamS pheromone (twofold), and two putative lipoproteins (SAUSA300_2403 = twofold, SAUSA300_0411 = threefold).
PMC3584211	R09000	A consideration with this pooled analysis is that a protein may be processed by secreted proteases into potentially inactive fragments, as a result of endoproteolysis.
PMC3584211	R10006	We also performed specific fraction analysis as detailed above to determine those proteins with altered protein stability upon deletion of the extracellular proteases (Fig. 8 and Table S4).
PMC3591372	D00001	In the current cohort study, we further investigated several newly found candidates, ceruloplasmin, myeloperoxidase, complement factor H and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, by comparing their plasma levels during the active phase of aGvHD and after the complete response to aGvHD therapy.
PMC3591372	M10000	The samples were diluted, and the target proteins were measured using ELISA kits at the following antibody concentrations, according to each manufacturer's protocol: ceruloplasmin, 1:400 (Assaypro, EC4001-1); myeloperoxidase, 1:20 (Bender, BMS2038INST); complement factor H, 1:20000 (Hycult Biotech, HK342); and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein, 1:2000 (Assaypro, EG5001-1).
PMC3608855	A00000	We carried out a genome-wide association study of serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity in 866 Amish participants of the Heredity and Phenotype Intervention Heart Study and identified significant association of AST activity with a cluster of single nucleotide polymorphisms located on chromosome 10q24.1 (peak association was rs17109512; P=2.80E-14), in the vicinity of GOT1, the gene encoding cytosolic AST (cAST).
PMC3608855	A00008	Remarkably, we did not find any association between the deletion and metabolic traits including serum fasting glucose or insulin, fasting and post-meal lipids, inflammatory markers, or sub-clinical markers of cardiovascular disease.
PMC3608855	D00000	Serum AST activity levels are determined by both genetic and environmental factors.4,5 Variation in serum AST activity has a moderate heritable basis (0.32–0.40) estimated from twin studies.4,5
PMC3608855	D00001	A GWAS of AST protein levels, as one of the group of 42 proteins measured in 1200 in CHIANTI study participants, didn’t find any cis-effect associations with SNPs near or in GOT1 or trans-effect associations with SNPs elsewhere in the genome.8
PMC3608855	D00002	In another GWAS, no SNP was associated with serum levels of AST at or exceeding genome-wide significance.9 Through a GWAS of serum AST activity in the OOA, we identified a rare in-frame 3 bp deletion in GOT1 that was strongly associated with low serum AST activity in the OOA.
PMC3608855	D00003	Subjects heterozygous for the GOT1 c.1165_1167delAAC had serum AST activity levels that were about one-half that of wild-type homozygotes.
PMC3608855	D00004	Consistent with this observation, functional studies found that AST activity of the mutant AST recombinant protein was totally abolished.
PMC3608855	D01000	Elevated serum AST activity is a clinical marker for damage to hepatocytes, myocardial cells or skeletal muscle.
PMC3608855	D01001	By contrast, decreased serum AST and its clinical significance are less known.
PMC3608855	D01002	This loss-of-function mutation in AST provides a unique opportunity to determine if decreased AST is associated with a clinically significant phenotype.
PMC3608855	D01003	Although AST has a pivotal role in intermediary metabolism, deficiency might be expected to lead to abnormalities in glucose and/or lipid metabolism.
PMC3608855	I00000	Aspartate aminotransferase (AST; EC 2.6.1.1) catalyzes the reversible conversion between aspartate/α-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate/glutamate, and has an important role in amino acid metabolism and in the urea and tricarboxylic acid cycles.1 AST is conserved from all prokaryotic to eukaryotic organisms and is expressed in many types of cells/tissues including liver, red blood cells and cardiac/skeletal muscles.
PMC3608855	I01000	The locus for soluble AST (GOT1) is on chromosome 10q24, whereas the mitochondrial form of AST (GOT2) is on 16q12.
PMC3608855	I01001	Twin studies4,5 suggest that serum AST activity is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.
PMC3608855	I01002	However, to date, specific gene variants that influence serum AST activity and/or metabolic or other phenotypes that may be associated with AST activity have yet to be identified.
PMC3608855	I01003	We sought to determine the genetic determinants of serum AST levels by carrying out a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of serum AST in 866 Amish subjects from the Heredity and Phenotype Intervention (HAPI) Heart Study.
PMC3608855	M06003	For construction of cASTmut (c.1165_1167delAAC), three fragment In-Fusion cloning was carried out with mutant 5′-end fragment (PCR amplified with upstream primer p2254 and downstream primer p2323 5′-ccactcacgattcgaccacttggcagcag-3′ on wild-type cAST cDNA template), mutant 3′-end fragment (PCR amplified with upstream primer p2313 5′-ggtcgaatcgtgagtggcttaaccaccaaa-3′ and downstream primer p2255 on wtAST template), and fragment of HindIII and Xba-precut pFlag-CMV2, to make the mutant cAST expression vector pFlag-CMV2-cASTmut.
PMC3608855	M08000	AST activity was determined by using the AST kit (Catachem, Oxford, CT, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction.
PMC3608855	M08001	Briefly, 5 μl of cell lysate was incubated with a 0.2 ml mixture of reagent A and B containing L-aspartate, NADH, malate dehydrogenase and 2-oxoglutarate at 25 °C.
PMC3608855	M08005	One unit of AST activity was defined as the amount of enzyme, which catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol l−1 of NAD per minute under conditions of the assay at 25 °C.
PMC3608855	R00000	We carried out a GWAS of serum AST activity levels in 866 Amish subjects from the HAPI Heart Study.
PMC3608855	R00002	In the GWAS, the strongest SNP associations with serum AST levels were observed for a group of SNPs located on chromosome 10q24.1.
PMC3608855	R03000	To further examine the functional consequences of p.Asn389del, we conducted in vitro functional studies by expressing the recombinant wild-type and mutant cAST (p.Asn389del) in the mammalian kidney cell line HEK293 and measuring AST activity.
PMC3608855	R03002	AST activity levels were increased by >100 fold in a dose-dependent manner when the cells were expressing wild-type cAST (lanes 2 and 3).
PMC3608855	R03006	Interestingly, the activities from the cells transfected with wild-type and mutant cAST at a 1:1 ratio were less than half of that of wild-type AST (lane 4 versus 3; P<0.001), suggesting a dominant negative effect.
PMC3608930	D03000	DENND1B (also known as DENN/MADD) is expressed in a wide range of tissues and cells, including adipocytes, but most predominantly in natural killer cells and dendritic cells.[32] DENND1B is predicted to exert its effects through the TNF-pathway via binding to the TNFR1, whereby MAP kinase activation and arachidonic acid release take place.[42] DENND1B has been proposed to have dual activities under normal and stress conditions such as hypoxia or macrophage invasion.[43]
PMC3636716	R07005	The lack of replication was not explained by differences in the allele frequency between discovery and replication control cohorts (P ≥ 0.1 for the difference in frequency between control datasets for all SNPs, except rs17862876, which showed a slightly lower risk allele frequency in the replication controls (P = 0.018) and thus would be biased toward association in the same direction as in the discovery set).
PMC3638140	M02001	A total of 500 ng of genomic DNA, 330 femtomoles of probe mixture (ignoring the contribution of the spiked-in poor performers), and 1 μL of 10× Ampligase DNA ligase buffer (Epicentre) were added to molecular biology-grade water for a total of 10 μL.
PMC3638140	M03000	Following the gap-fill and ligation phase, the reactions were cooled to 37°C, and to each reaction we added 20 units of Exonuclease I (NEB) and 100 units of Exonuclease III (NEB) to degrade uncircularized probe and genomic DNA.
PMC3638140	M03001	The digestion was incubated at 37°C for 45 min, heated to 80°C, and incubated for 20 min to inactivate the exonucleases.
PMC3638140	M04000	After exonuclease treatment and heat-inactivation, the samples were cooled on ice and, optionally, stored at −20°C.
PMC3638140	M04001	For each capture reaction, two PCR reactions were prepared, each with Phusion HF buffer to 1× (Fermentas), forward primer and indexed reverse PCR primers to 500 nM, SYBR green (Invitrogen) to 0.5×, dNTPs to 200 μm each (NEB), 2 units of Phusion Hot-Start II polymerase, 10 μL of capture reaction, and nuclease-free water to 50 μL. PCR cycling conditions were an initial denaturation step for 2 min at 95°C, followed by 26 cycles of: 15 sec at 98°C, 15 sec at 65°C, and 45 sec at 72°C.
PMC3645730	R05000	Previous studies revealed that the expression of PLA2 in cancer patients was upregulated [19,20].
PMC3645730	R05001	The activity of PLA2 was observed as significantly higher in invasive breast tumor tissues than benign breast tumor tissues and normal breast tissues [21,22].

PMC3675060	D04000	In conclusion, a potential peroxidase mediated oxidation of estrogens to very reactive carcinogenic quinone methides has been demonstrated in humans.
PMC3675060	M14000	The incubation mixture consisted of 0.5 µM substrate (E1 or E2), 1 unit LPO, and 0.25 µM H2O2 in 10 mM K2HPO4, pH 7.0.
PMC3675060	M19000	For LPO assay, separations on the UPLC system were conducted using an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 1.8 µm column (1×50 mm) at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min.

PMC3691078	D01000	In the current study, an unbiased GWAS detected a significant association with SNP(s) in the MGMT gene and cellular sensitivity to temozolomide.
PMC3691078	M02000	The 529 LCLs derived from the CAP cohort were incubated under standardized conditions for 24hr, after which MGMT transcript levels were quantified using the Illumina H8v3 beadarray (Illumina probe ILMN_1795639).
PMC3691078	M02001	Arrays were quantile transformed to the overall average empirical distribution across all arrays, and MGMT expression values quantile normalized.
PMC3691078	M09000	Methylation beta values were assessed for 20 different probes that are associated with MGMT (chr10: 131155063 – 131302958).
PMC3691078	M09001	We then assessed whether SNPs of interest altered methylation beta values for the probes assigned to MGMT using analysis of variance.
PMC3691078	R01000	To determine if these SNPs are potentially functionally relevant, we next sought to test for association with MGMT transcript levels and examined how these genotypes are related to differential dose response.
PMC3691078	R02000	Rs531572 was highly significantly associated with both IC50 values (p<10−6,4, Figure 3A) and MGMT transcript levels (p<10−25, Figure 3B) with the A allele associated with that higher IC50 values and greater MGMT transcript levels.
PMC3691078	R02001	There was a direct correlation between MGMT transcript levels and temozolomide response with greater endogenous MGMT transcript levels associated with IC50 (p<0.006, Figure 4).
PMC3691078	R02002	However, inter-individual variation in MGMT transcript levels only explained 1.8% of the variation in IC50.
PMC3691078	R03002	The first 4 methylation probes associated with MGMT (situated within the promoter region of the gene and most likely to influence expression levels) have median beta values < 2.0, indicating little methylation, while the probes situated on the latter part of the gene have median beta values > 0.8, indicating they are highly methylation.

PMC3725073	R15002	DGRs were identified by searching contigs for regions that matched three criteria: (i) they contained protein-coding regions resembling reverse transcriptases, (ii) they encompassed short repeat regions containing mismatches in adenine positions, and (iii) they contained hypervariable regions.
PMC3725073	R15003	Of the 20 contigs with both a reverse transcriptase and an adenine-mismatched repeat, six were associated with hypervariable regions (located no more than 100 bp away; Table S3) and were selected for further study.

PMC3760386	I00000	Thymidylate synthase (TS) catalyzes the conversion of deoxyuridylate (dUMP) and 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to dTMP and 7,8-dihydrofolate.
PMC3760386	I00001	This reaction is the sole de novo biosynthesis of thymine in DNA and therefore, inhibition of TS blocks DNA synthesis and thereby causing cell death.
PMC3760386	I00002	Given its essential role in DNA synthesis, TS is an important target for chemotherapeutic drugs, such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine (orally bioavailable 5-FU prodrug).
PMC3760386	I00006	It has been proposed that, instead of inhibiting TS, the possibility exists of using the high catalytic activity of TS to activate deoxyuridine prodrugs to form toxic byproducts that could be incorporated into DNA thereby causing cell death
PMC3760386	I00008	For patients whose tumors express a high level of TS, there is no FDA-approved therapeutic drug currently available that targets this pathway.
PMC3760386	I00009	Hence, a therapy that is specifically targeted toward tumors that express high levels of TS could have widespread applicability.
PMC3760386	I01000	FAU [1-(2′-deoxy-2′-fluoro-β-D-arabinofuranosyl) uracil] is a pyrimidine nucleoside, which acts as a suicide prodrug, taking advantage of high TS activity as a mechanism of activation.
PMC3760386	I01001	FAU has been shown to be readily transported into several cell lines and converted by intracellular thymidine kinase (TK) to its monophosphate, 1-(2-deoxy-2-fluoro-β-D-arabinofuranosyl) uracil monophosphate (FAUMP), which is then methylated by TS in the 5-position to form the methylated product FMAUMP
PMC3760386	I01008	The Karmanos Cancer Institute (KCI) Phase I service has recently received approval from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) to conduct a Phase I clinical trial of FAU in patients with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors for which standard curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective.

PMC3811377	D01000	Our results suggest that most of the detectable bacterial DNA in the lung parenchyma is DNase I sensitive and corresponds to dead bacteria.
PMC3811377	D03000	Although there is some intrinsic DNase activity in the airway surface (41), DNA can remain in the lungs for a significant time under certain conditions.
PMC3811377	M03000	Five hundred microliters of BAL fluid or a homogenate (02-542; Fisher Healthcare, Houston, TX) of 100 mg lung tissue in 2 ml of 0.9% NaCl was incubated with 500 μg/ml DNase I (10104159001; Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Manheim, Germany) or DNase I buffer at 37°C for 10 min, followed by DNase I inactivation at 75°C for 10 min.
PMC3811377	R03000	DNase I has been used to purify intact DNA in viruses with capsids and/or envelopes from mixtures containing DNase I-sensitive free and protein-associated DNA without a capsid (31).
PMC3811377	R03001	In the food industry, DNase-treated DNA PCR (DTD-PCR) has been used to detect DNA from live bacteria contaminating food accurately and with minimal cytotoxic effects on bacteria (32, 33).
PMC3811377	R03002	In order to determine whether bacterial DNA quantified with qPCR corresponded to intact or dead bacteria, we treated samples with DNase I and followed this with heat inactivation before cell lysis as the initial step for sample DNA extraction; comparison of treated and untreated samples would determine the ratio of DNA from intact bacteria to that from total bacteria.
PMC3811377	R05000	To determine whether DNase I treatment directly results in bacterial death, we incubated S. aureus with DNase I and determined viability after incubation by dilution plating (Fig. 3C).
PMC3811377	R05001	DNase I treatment of S. aureus resulted in an increase of 15 to 20% in counts using the plate dilution method.
PMC3811377	R05004	We speculate that this effect could be caused by DNase improving individual cell dispersion prior to plating, perhaps by dissolving biofilms, but this does not seem to enhance bacterial growth.
PMC3811377	R05005	We conclude that DNase treatment before cell lysis is not cytotoxic to bacteria and allows discernment of DNA of intact bacteria from that of dead bacteria and free bacterial DNA.
PMC3811377	R06000	In order to determine the load of DNA from live bacteria in the lungs, we used DNase I treatment before cell lysis followed by 16S rRNA qPCR in BAL fluid samples and compared them to lung homogenates from healthy pigs.
PMC3811377	R07000	We found that all BAL fluid samples had a mixture of DNase I-sensitive and -resistant DNA, with DNase I treatment reducing the measured bacterial load in BAL fluid samples by 63%, to an average of 1.05 × 106 ± 6.5 × 105 CFU/ml (Fig. 4A).
PMC3811377	R07001	In 6 out of the 11 lung homogenates, all DNA was DNase I sensitive, suggesting the absence of live bacteria (Fig. 4B).
PMC3811377	R07002	On average, 94.4% of the bacterial DNA was DNase I sensitive in lung homogenates.
PMC3811377	R08003	We found that bacteria in transbronchial BAL fluid samples were similar to those in transoral BAL fluid samples, with clear dominance from bacteria in the Sphingobacteriales order and Mycoplasmataceae, Xanthomonadaceae, and Pasteurellaceae families and with some samples containing abundant Streptococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae, among others.
PMC3811377	R09000	The presence of a small amount of DNase I-resistant DNA in some but not all of the lung homogenate samples may represent a community of symbiotic bacteria.
PMC3811377	R09001	We hypothesized that DNase I-resistant DNA would show an overrepresentation of specific taxa compared to DNase I-untreated samples.
PMC3811377	R10000	We found that in samples in which bacteria were detectable by qPCR, most 16S rRNA gene sequences corresponded to the Bacteroidaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae families, with similar proportions in DNase-treated and untreated samples (Fig. 5, lung).
PMC3816124	D01002	Similar to the known tumor suppressor gene phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN),[29] MTMR proteins function as phosphoinositide- 3-phosphatases and antagonize the activity of specific classes of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases.[30] Although it contains an inactive phosphatase domain, SBF2 enhances the catalytic activity of and may alter the cellular localization of MTMR2, a phosphatase-competent member of the MTMR family.[31]

PMC3882906	D03006	Interestingly, vascular injury and immune deregulation, which are both SSc hallmarks, are related to cell damage and deregulated apoptosis.66 Therefore, the association between SSc (especially ACA+ SSc) and the rs35677470 loss-of-function variant in DNASE1L3 might provide a link between a defective apoptotic DNA breakdown and the production of ACA.
PMC3882906	M15001	We used the Regulome, Genevar, and Blood eQTL browser resources to explore the evidence of transcription factor binding sites, DNase hypersensitivity sites, and expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) in the publicly available ENCODE database and additional eQTL databases.42–44 Molecular graphics and analyses of DNASE1L3, HLA-DPAβ1, HLA-DQα1, and HLA-DRβ1 structure were performed with the UCSF Chimera package.45

PMC3907856	I01006	Phostensin binds to the pointed ends of actin filaments but not to actin monomers, sides of filaments, or barbed ends of filaments, retarding the elongation and depolymerization rates of gelsolin-actin seeds and reducing the rate of G-actin addition at the pointed ends [4,6].

PMC3907856	R02001	Although PP1 and actin were precipitated by PT-2 monoclonal antibody from protein extracts of Jurkat cells, it may arise from interaction with phostensin-α instead of phostensin-β

PMC3943323	D03000	A number of findings indicate that this mechanism may be working in the generation of MP in TI patients: (i) HMC are contained in MP found in patients’ plasma or are released from TI-RBC in vitro; (ii) the degree of band 3 oxidation and phosphorylation in TI-RBC correlates with the amount of membrane-bound HMC; (iii) in TI-RBC and phenylhydrazine-treated RBC there was microscopy evidence that HMC are bound to protruding areas of the membrane that can be easily shed following moderate mechanical stress; (iv) in TI-RBC, Syk inhibitors diminished both band 3 phosphorylation and the rate of MP release; and (v) phenylhydrazine, which induces HMC formation in control RBC without directly oxidizing band 3, caused a Syk kinase-dependent release of MP accompanied by oxidation, phosphorylation and clustering of band 3.

PMC3971604	D07002	Pyruvate carboxyl transferase catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to oxaloacetate while glyoxylate reductase is an enzyme in the oxalate synthesis pathway responsible for converting glyoxylate to glycolate [15].
PMC3971604	D07003	Alterations in these gene sets may be markers of the health of the microbial community.
PMC3971604	D09003	Additionally, a deficiency in glyoxylate reductase may result in increased levels of glyoxylate which has been shown to inhibit the interaction of the Vitamin D receptor (VDR) with vitamin D response elements (VDREs)
PMC3971604	D10006	However, inspection of the taxonomic assignments of the annotated genes (via phylogenomic inference) across all four samples revealed a lower relative abundance of known SRBs when compared to the other three samples, indicating that a sulfide-mediated phenomenon may not be a key requirement for the onset of NEC.
PMC3971604	R08000	Of the cofactors, vitamins, prosthetic groups, and pigment subsystems represented within the Group A of higher abundance genes detected in the pre-NEC sample, two sets were associated with tetrapyrroles (specifically heme and siroheme biosynthesis; precorrin-2 oxidase [EC 1.3.1.76] and sirohydrochlorin ferrochelatase [EC 4.99.1.4]) while the third was associated with folate and pterines (YgfZ; S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione dehydrogenase [EC 1.1.1.284]).

PMC3977717	A04000	Conclusions: Our results suggest that some genes previously identified as influencing lung function are independently associated with emphysema rather than lung function, and that genes related to α-mannosidase may influence risk of emphysema.

PMC3991606	D02001	The parasite nicotinamidase and NMNAT exhibit transcriptional peaks around 20 and 40 hours post invasion, while the nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase and NAD+ synthase enzymes are maximally transcribed between 25–28 hours.
PMC3991606	D02002	Although it has been proposed [41] that NAD+ synthesis would peak with NAD+ synthase expression, we observe steady NAD+ production throughout the IDC.
PMC3991606	D02003	This is likely necessary to maintain NAD+ pools to replace the NAD+ that is lost to turnover and provides a sufficient increase in total NAD+ required for the development of new merozoites.

PMC3991606	R05003	We generated an E. coli strain where the nadD locus was replaced with the chloramphenicol (cam) drug resistance cassette (nadD::cam) and the non-essential linked gene, ybeT, was replaced with a kanamycin (kan) drug resistance cassette (ybeT::kan).
PMC3991606	R07000	Based on a previous report that demonstrated the anti-parasitic activity of the known bacterial NMNAT inhibitor, compound 1_03 [25], renamed 1a-a in this study, we sought to characterize the specificity of this compound further.
PMC3991606	R09000	We chose to modify the aniline group (R1) because differentially substituted anilines have previously been tested against bacterial NMNAT and have yielded strong inhibition (Sorci et al., 2009).
PMC3994512	R00002	The final conversion to butyrate is performed by various butyryl-CoA transferases that use cosubstrates either formed earlier in the individual pathways, namely, acetoacetate and 4-hydroxybutyrate for the lysine and 4-aminobutyrate pathways, respectively, or from external sources, as shown for butyryl-CoA:acetate CoA transferase (But) (23).
PMC3994512	R00004	 1 have been proposed as final enzymes as well (19), and our data support those suggestions (see below)
PMC3994512	R08002	However, the acetyl-CoA pathway, especially, shows exceptions, where alternative transferases were found in several isolates (Fig. 2) (19), and gene arrangement analysis indicated that transferases linked to other pathways might catalyze the final step to butyrate in certain isolates (e.g., see Fusobacteria or Porphyromonas).
PMC3994512	R08003	Several paralogous genes were detected for both buk, associated with C. botulinum and Clostridium difficile, and but, derived mainly from Lachnospiraceae, Syntrophomonadaceae, and Veillonellaceae, at the bottoms of individual trees (Fig. 3).

PMC3994512	R11002	Alternative transferases were detected only at very low abundances, suggesting that those enzymes do not play an important role for butyrate synthesis in healthy humans.

PMC4020801	D08000	In humans, prostaglandin H2-D isomerase catalyzes the conversion of prostaglandin H2 to prostaglandin D2, which functions as a neuromodulator and as a trophic factor in the central nervous system for fatty acid biosynthesis.
PMC4020801	D09000	The bioinformatic analyses using GO-term clustering, physical interaction module assembly, and KEGG pathway data mapping have shown an involvement of pathways consisting of fatty acid binding and transport, exocytosis, and protease inhibitory activity, which are also partially involved in Complement and coagulation cascades.
PMC4020801	D10000	The interactome analysis surprisingly showed a highly interconnected network of 18 of the 19 relevant proteins, where only 36 additional molecules were needed to generate a specific molecular network, suggesting that the up-regulated proteins form a potential dysregulated functional cluster encompassing immune responses and complement cascade proteins, protease cascades maybe linked to the membrane attack complex or possibly to counteract the enzymatic effect of up-regulated molecules such as GPX3, RBP3 and PTGDS, or as modulators of gene activation cascades.
PMC4020801	D11000	The up-regulation of GPX3 is of particular interest, since it was shown previously that cataracts contain elevated levels of oxidants such as dehydroascorbic acid (DHA), indicative of oxidative stress, linked to a potentially elevated level of extracellular glutathione peroxidase GPX3 [42].
PMC4036550	R06006	In addition, BLASTx searching indicated that many contigs (such as comp6291_c0_seq1, comp48905_c0_seq1, comp8098_c0_seq1, comp6984_c0_seq1, comp92776_c0_seq1, comp71626_c0_seq1 and comp36376_c0_seq1) shared equivalent or relatively higher amino acid identity (52%–85%, e-values of 7e−12–4e−35) with poxvirus rather than retroviruses, with Fowlpox virus (FPV) being the closest relative.

PMC4123862	A02000	Our findings suggest that along with the FADS gene cluster, additional genes may influence n6 PUFA composition.
PMC4123862	D01001	In particular, the C allele of rs174547 in FADS1 was associated with a higher proportion of LA and lower GLA (consistent with lower delta-6 desaturase activity), and a higher proportion of DGLA and lower AA (consistent with lower delta-5 desaturase activity).
PMC4123862	D01002	This polymorphism has previously been recognized for its association with n6 PUFAs and desaturase activities22, and our findings build upon and extend these prior observations by documenting additional inverse associations with GLA and DGLA.
PMC4123862	D01005	It remains unclear whether such FADS polymorphisms have biological effects on plasma FA composition40-43, and our findings highlight the need for additional study of potential interaction among FADS variation, n6 PUFAs, and metabolic biomarkers and health outcomes.
PMC4123862	D03000	Apart from our novel findings for the FADS gene cluster, additional novel associations were observed among multiple n6 PUFAs and gene variants of NRBF2, PDXDC1, AGPAT1, and NTAN1.

PMC4123862	I01000	To date, the best characterized genes shown to affect plasma and membrane PUFA composition are the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) genes, FADS1 and FADS2.
PMC4123862	I01001	These biologically relevant candidate genes encode the delta-5 and delta-6 desaturases which participate in the metabolic conversion of the essential fatty acid linoleic acid (LA) to longer chain n6 PUFAs (Figure 1).
PMC4123862	I01002	Candidate gene studies have demonstrated significant associations of the minor alleles in the FADS cluster with multiple n6 PUFAs including arachidonic acid (20:4n6, AA), linoleic acid (18:2n6, LA), gamma linoleic acid (18:3n6, GLA), dihomo gamma linoleic acid (20:3n6, DGLA), and adrenic acid (22:4n6, AdrA)19-22.
PMC4123862	I01003	A recent GWAS of fatty acids confirmed the association of genetic variants in FADS1, FADS2, and FADS3 with LA and AA18; however, it remains unknown whether other loci beyond FADS influence LA and AA composition, and whether any genetic loci influence levels of the other n6 fatty acids including GLA, DGLA, and AdrA.
PMC4149216	I00000	Alcohol dependence (AD) is a moderately heritable disorder for which two major families of risk genes have been mapped via linkage and candidate gene association studies: the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) family, which contributes to variation in speed of ethanol metabolism and yields a variable concentration of acetaldehyde following alcohol consumption; and the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) gene family, which mediates acetaldehyde clearance (Edenberg 2007; Li et al. 2011, 2012a, 2012b).

PMC4284067	R06000	Sources of oxidative stress in ALS have been investigated most thoroughly in mutant SOD1 (mSOD1) models, where several aberrant oxidative reactions have been proposed.
PMC4284067	R06001	However, enzymatically inactive SOD1, depleted of copper loading, is still capable of causing motor neuron degeneration, and mSOD1 may cause oxidative stress by mechanisms beyond its own catalytic activity (26).
PMC4284067	R06002	mSOD1 within microglia increases superoxide production by NADPH oxidase (Nox) enzymes.
PMC4284067	R06003	SOD1 stabilizes Rac1-GTP in the activated Nox2 complex, and mutant SOD1 locks Rac1 into its active state, with resultant prolongation of ROS production (27).

PMC4525767	D02015	Other plausible explanations for the lack of effect of insulin sensitizer therapy on BCAA concentrations include an adaptation of BCAA metabolism to chronically high circulating insulin in people with insulin resistance, or a blunted effect of insulin sensitizers on BCAA transamination, a process that is typically increased in people with diabetes [26,43].
PMC4548467	A01001	 M. tuberculosis gene expression was quantified via reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction in serial sputa from 17 Ugandans treated for drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis.

PMC4576037	R03000	Despite increases of resistance genes in the metagenome being more consistent in the Central Africa group, no ESBL-positive strains were isolated among travelers returning from Africa.
PMC4576037	R03006	In all study subjects that acquired ESBL-producing E. coli, beta-lactamases associated with ESBL resistance were detected in the corresponding metagenomes, and all but one subject had acquired at least one ESBL gene that was not detected in the before specimens.
PMC4576037	R03007	Notably, the genes detected in the metagenomes were not the same as those present in the sequenced isolates, and in the majority of cases, metagenomics failed to detect any presence of the CTX-M gene.
PMC4576037	R03008	ESBL genes were frequently present in subjects without an ESBL-producing isolate, meaning that culturing for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriacae does not unambiguously predict the total resistance gene content and, conversely, detection of ESBL genes using metagenomics does not necessary imply identification of ESBL-resistant cultures.
PMC4576037	R03009	We found no evidence for acquisition of genes encoding carbapenemases by culturing or by metagenomic sequencing approaches.
PMC4592389	R02001	To evaluate the effects of low AIPL1, expression on paclitaxel-induced neurotoxicity, we modulated the gene in neurons through transient siRNA transfection and verified with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), a reduction of expression in AIPL1 to 62% and 14% relative to control at 24 and 48 hours post transfection relative to non-targeting control (Figure 3A).

PMC4819009	D01010	Notably, higher blood lactate levels are associated with a higher risk of incident diabetes [4,18]; therefore, the positive association between lactate and incident diabetes probably reflects mechanisms independent of the GCKR pathway.
PMC4876170	M05000	Plasma levels of total (un-cleaved) cytokeratin-18 (M65) and caspase cleaved cytokeratin-18 (M30) were quantified with commercially available ELISAs (Peviva AB, Bromma Sweden), previously validated in clinical trials and used according to manufacturer’s instructions as described elsewhere [36].
PMC4892810	R04000	Additionally, genomic analysis revealed that there were two different homologs of arginine kinase and eight different heat-shock protein 70 (HSP70) homologs, with the predicted sequences of the various homologs differing.
PMC4892810	R04001	Both proteins were present on 2D gels as a group of similarly migrating spots and tryptic fragment sequences aligning to both arginine kinase homologs and to six of the eight HSP70 homologs were identified, confirming that most of the various homologs of these two proteins were translated into protein.
PMC4893679	D03000	The source of suggested prognostic value of serum lipase levels is somewhat unclear.
PMC4893679	D03001	It has been shown that serum lipase levels are more accurate than serum amylase levels in the diagnosis of AP.32 Although there was no difference in the incidence of AP in their medical history (6/9 AP vs. 8/18

PMC4915629	A04001	Our results suggest that, since kynurenine monoxygenase diverts the kynurenine pathway toward the synthesis of xanthurenic acid, its inhibition may also contribute to glucose homeostasis.
PMC4915629	D03000	The enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) is located at a critical branching point in the kynurenine pathway such that the inhibition of this enzyme by either pharmacological or genetic means may shift the flux towards the formation of kynurenic acid rather than to the synthesis of xanthurenic acid.
PMC4915629	D03001	The inhibition of KMO has suggested that KMO regulates the production of downstream KP metabolites.
PMC4915629	D03002	We have previously shown that the adipose tissue expression of KMO was associated with higher HbA1c in women with obesity and was expressed preferentially in pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages [7].
PMC4915629	D03003	Both the activation of KMO and, consequently, the potential synthesis of xanthurenic acid may be deleterious to glucose homeostasis.
PMC4915629	I00003	Our group and others previously showed that obesity is associated with an increased expression of the IDO1 gene in the human adipose tissue and with increased concentrations of circulating kynurenines and kynurenine to tryptophan (K/T) ratio reflecting the increased enzymatic activity of IDO1, that also correlates with the increased expression of inflammatory markers in the adipose tissue

PMC5036217	D04000	Elevated ALP serum levels are used in PSC diagnosis,12 as well as in follow-up of the disease, as elevated levels reveal cholestasis.
PMC5036217	D04001	Growing evidence suggests that reduced levels of ALP are associated with an improved prognosis in PSC.3132
PMC5036217	D04002	In our cohort, the genus Enterococcus positively correlated with ALP in univariate analysis, suggesting a potential link between these bacteria and disease severity.

PMC5347185	R05003	In addition, we detected a significant effect of year of sampling (F1,69 = 3.03, P < 0.004), likely because some subtypes occurred only in certain years, and the interaction between HA and NA subtype and the year that the mallards were sampled was significant (F1,69 = 2.14, P = 0.007).
PMC5398544	R06002	To further explore and quantify the decrease in complex lipids, we carried out a quantitative analysis in 8 of the 11 paired samples and found a significant depletion of 22 lysolipids and enrichment of 5 species of phosphatidylcholine during CM (p < 0.05, FDR < 0.10) (Fig 3, S2 Table).

PMC5426060	A02000	Three intronic variants located within DSE (dermatan sulfate epimerase) on 6q22 were associated with fast beta EEG at a genome wide significant level (p<5×10−8).
PMC5426060	A02004	Previous studies have indicated that DSE is involved in a network of genes integral to membrane organization; gene-based tests indicated that several variants within this network (i.e., DSE, ZEB2, RND3, MCTP1, and CTBP2) were also associated with beta EEG (empirical p<0.05), and of these genes, ZEB2 and CTBP2 were associated with DSM-V Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD; empirical p<0.05).
PMC5426060	A03000	In this sample of EA families enriched for AUDs, fast beta EEG is associated with variants within DSE on 6q22; the most significant SNP influences the mRNA expression of DSE and ROS1 in hippocampus and temporal cortex, brain regions important for beta EEG activity.
PMC5426060	A03002	Converging data from GWAS, gene expression, and gene-networks presented in this study provide support for the role of genetic variants within DSE and related genes in neural hyperexcitability, and has highlighted two potential candidate genes for AUD and/or related neurological conditions: ZEB2 and CTBP2.
PMC5426060	D01000	In a GWAS of fronto-central fast beta EEG in families of EA, we report a genome-wide significant signal in an intronic region of DSE (dermatin sulfate) on 6q22.
PMC5426060	D01012	Further, researchers have hypothesized that cognitive impairments observed in Alzheimer’s disease may involve disrupted functional connectivity between frontotemporal and frontoparietal regions related to beta (and alpha) frequency EEG (Hsiao et al., 2013).
PMC5426060	D02000	Variation within DSE has been associated with several cancers (Gouignard et al., 2016a; Thelin et al., 2013, 2012), Heschl’s Gyrus thickness (Cai et al., 2014), and is also a notable risk factor for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, with a subtype specifically linked to dysfunction of DSE (Müller et al., 2013).
PMC5426060	D02002	(Gouignard et al., 2016b) demonstrates a functional role for dse (the protein encoded by DSE) in cranial neural crest cell migration and in cell adhesion providing a potential biological mechanism linking DSE dysfunction to Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and other neural crest related disorders (i.e., neurocristopathies); the knockdown of dse impaired the correct activation of transcription factors involved in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition and reduced the extent of neural crest cell migration, subsequently leading to a decrease in neural crest-derived craniofacial skeleton, melanocytes and dorsal fin structures.
PMC5426060	D04000	Based on previous physical, co-expression, co-localization and pathway gene-gene interactions observed in the literature, GeneMANIA indicated that DSE is involved in a network of genes integral to membrane organization (Table 2).
PMC5426060	D07000	Since the three genome-wide associated variants were located within an intron of DSE, this discussion has primarily focused on DSE and related gene networks.
PMC5426060	D10002	The most significant SNP is an eQTL for DSE, a gene encoding a protein important in cranial neural crest development, previously implicated in several complex traits (e.g., Ehlers Danlos syndrome, bipolar disorder, brain morphology) and expressed in hippocampus and temporal cortex, brain regions of importance to beta EEG.
PMC5426060	R00000	Three highly correlated (i.e., in high linkage disequilibrium; r2 =1.0; D-prime=1.0 based on hg19 1000 Genomes from the CEU sample) intronic SNPs (rs10456907, rs13214667, rs2252790) located within DSE (dermatan sulfate epimerase) on 6q22 were associated with fast beta EEG at a genome wide significant level (p<5×10−8).
PMC5426060	R01000	Braineac indicates that rs2252790 is nominally associated with the mRNA expression of DSE/TSPYL1 (TSPY like 4), and ROS1 (ROS proto-oncogene 1, receptor tyrosine kinase) in several brain regions.
PMC5426060	R02000	Following the identification of gene networks of relevance to GWAS findings (i.e., genes shown to interact with DSE via physical, co-expression, co-localization and/or pathway analyses in previous studies, curated using GeneMANIA as described above), gene-based analyses indicated that when considered as a set (all available SNPs in a given gene, corrected for the number of independent signals within that gene set), variants within the following genes are associated with fast beta EEG (empirical p-value<0.05): DSE, ZEB2, MCTP1, RND3 and CTBP2 (Table 3).

PMC5511775	A00000	Remission induction therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) includes medications that may cause hepatotoxicity, including asparaginase.
PMC5511775	A00001	We used a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify loci associated with elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) levels after induction therapy in children with ALL enrolled on St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital (SJCRH) protocols.
PMC5511775	A00003	Adjusting for age, body mass index, ancestry, asparaginase preparation and dosage, the PNPLA3 rs738409 (C>G) I148M variant, previously associated with fatty liver disease risk, had the strongest genetic association with ALT (P = 2.5×10−8).
PMC5511775	A00004	The PNPLA3 rs738409 variant explained 3.8% of the variability in ALT, and partly explained race-related differences in ALT.
PMC5511775	A00005	The PNPLA3 rs738409 association was replicated in an independent cohort of 2,285 patients treated on Children’s Oncology Group protocol AALL0232 (P = 0.024).
PMC5511775	D00000	Patients with ALL are at increased risk for the development of toxicities, including hepatotoxicity, which is partly reflected by elevated serum aminotransferase levels.(3)
PMC5511775	D00001	Our objectives were to use a genome-wide approach to determine inherited variation associated with ALT elevation among a racially diverse set of pediatric patients with ALL at a uniform time point (the end of remission induction), adjusting for clinical and other covariates potentially associated with increased ALT levels.
PMC5511775	D00002	Although many ALL medications can contribute to elevations in serum ALT, our multivariate analysis suggested that elevated post-induction chemotherapy ALT levels were linked to asparaginase exposure (Figures 1A&B, Table 3).
PMC5511775	D00003	Patients on Total XVI (who all received PEGylated E. coli asparaginase) had higher ALT levels compared to the Total XV patients (who all received the less potent native E. coli asparaginase)
PMC5511775	D00004	(P = 0.041, Figure 1A, Table 3), despite the fact that patients on Total XV received pre-induction high-dose methotrexate whereas those on Total XVI did not (Table 1, Figure S9), suggesting an effect of asparaginase preparation on hepatotoxicity.
PMC5511775	D00005	Moreover, those who received additional asparaginase during induction had higher ALT levels compared to those that did not receive additional asparaginase (P = 2.7×10−4, Figure 1B, Table 3).
PMC5511775	D00006	Interestingly, serum bilirubin at end of induction did not differ by asparaginase exposure (data not shown).
PMC5511775	D00007	Adjusting for treatment, host-related covariates (e.g., age, BMI percentile) and ancestry, we found that the PNPLA3 rs738409 I148M variant associated with higher ALT levels.
PMC5511775	D00008	This is the identical genetic variant that has previously been linked to ALT elevation in the general population,(10) non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD),(12, 14, 15) NAFLD severity,(16) and hepatic fibrosis(15) in genome-wide studies.
PMC5511775	D00011	Overall in the discovery cohort of 715 patients, the median increase in ALT was 12 IU/L, or 33.3% of the median of the major allele homozygous (C/C) group, for each minor allele of PNPLA3 (P = 0.032), compared to a 6.0% increase for each allele observed in the general population,(10) suggesting that the effect of the variant is amplified during ALL therapy, and consistent with larger effect sizes for pharmacogenetic traits.(21)
PMC5511775	D01000	Because of hepatic infiltration of ALL at diagnosis and the prolonged use of potentially hepatotoxic chemotherapy, there is no optimal time to measure “baseline” ALT in ALL.(22)
PMC5511775	D01001	We did examine ALT levels at diagnosis within the SJCRH cohort and showed that serum ALT levels were lower at diagnosis than at end-of-induction (P < 2.2×10−16, paired t-test, Figure S8, Table 2), and that PNPLA3 rs738409 remains a significant risk factor (P = 4.4×10−6) for post-induction ALT elevation even after including diagnostic ALT as a covariate.
PMC5511775	D02000	Patatin-like Phospholipase Domain Containing Protein 3 (PNPLA3 or adiponutrin) is a member of the family of patatin-like lipolytic enzymes involved in triacylglycerol metabolism and signaling.(23)
PMC5511775	D03000	We confirmed that asparaginase exposure in mice indeed led to an accumulation of hepatic lipids and neutral triglycerides (Figure S7).
PMC5511775	D03001	The results suggest that the mechanism of asparaginase-induced hepatotoxicity may be similar to that of hepatic steatosis, and may be attenuated by therapies that can mitigate hepatic triglyceride accumulation.
PMC5511775	D03002	These results may have particular implications for adults with ALL, in whom hepatotoxicity is common.(26) Interestingly, an early postmortem study from 31 pediatric ALL patients that received native E. coli asparaginase found that 87% had developed steatosis after exposure to asparaginase.(27)
PMC5511775	D04000	We observed that ALT was higher (Table 3, Table S6) in those with ancestry indicating Hispanic status or whites than in blacks, as others have reported.(11)
PMC5511775	D04001	Differences in the risk allele frequency of the PNPLA3 rs738409 variant mirrored the differences in ALT among race groups (Figure 3B), although this variant did not reach statistical significance in blacks or Hispanics (Figures 3A&S3B), likely due to relatively low power because of small sample sizes for non-whites (with an effect size of 1.36 for the rs738409 variant, our power to detect a significant effect in separate GWASs of blacks and Hispanics was only 0.32 and 0.37, respectively).
PMC5511775	D04002	Although the PNPLA3 rs738409 variant accounted for some variability in ALT across race groups, race remained a significant risk factor for ALT even after accounting for PNPLA3 rs738409.
PMC5511775	D05000	We found that some of the additional association of race with ALT might be due to other genetic variants.
PMC5511775	D05001	For example, black patients carrying the PIGV rs12748152 and GREB1 rs149940960 variants had lower ALT levels compared to non-carriers (Figure 3C&D, Table S3).
PMC5511775	D06000	Although we think asparaginase was the most likely cause of post-induction ALT elevations in this study, we acknowledge that other elements of ALL induction therapy can also cause increases in ALT.
PMC5511775	D06002	but this was unlikely to have contributed to the end-of-induction ALT (which was measured 42–46 days after a single dose of methotrexate for Total XV), and because high-dose methotrexate was used prior to induction only in Total XV, not Total XVI (Table 1, Figure S9), and yet ALT was higher in patients enrolled on Total XVI compared to Total XV (Figure 1A).
PMC5511775	D06003	Likewise, although thiopurines can cause elevations in ALT, they are more prominent with mercaptopurine (used in Total XV) than with thioguanine (used in Total XVI) (Table 1),(36, 37) and thus unlikely to explain the higher ALT on Total XVI compare to Total XV.
PMC5511775	D06004	The use of PEG-asparaginase at 3000 units/m2 on Total XVI results in much higher and more prolonged serum asparaginase concentrations than the doses of native E. coli asparaginase that we used on Total XV.(38)
PMC5511775	D06005	Most tellingly, in both Total XV and Total XVI, ALT was higher in the 25% of patients who required extra doses of asparaginase due to high MRD during induction therapy than it was in those who did not receive extra doses (Figure 1B).
PMC5511775	D07000	The association of PNPLA3 rs738409 with ALT after induction therapy was replicated in the COG AALL0232 protocol.
PMC5511775	D08000	In summary, we have identified that elevated post-induction chemotherapy ALT levels were likely due primarily to asparaginase, and we found that the same PNPLA3 I148M variant that was previously shown to be the most important determinant of NAFLD in a general population of adults is associated with drug-induced increases in serum ALT.
PMC5511775	I01000	Some treatment regimens for adults with ALL avoid using and/or dose modify asparaginase and high-dose methotrexate in order to minimize treatment-related hepatotoxicity,(8, 9) which may contribute to the lower cure rates for adults with ALL.
PMC5511775	I02000	We investigated coding and non-coding genetic variants associated with the elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) after remission induction therapy.
PMC5511775	I02001	A total of 715 St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital patients were evaluable with genotyping and post-induction chemotherapy ALT levels.
PMC5511775	M02000	For the SJCRH cohort, ALT values were graded using CTCAE version 3.0.(41)
PMC5511775	M02001	ALT values between 1.0 ~ 2.5 fold of normal upper limit were assigned as grade 1, between 2.5 ~5.0 fold as grade 2, between 5.0 ~20.0 fold as grade 3, and > 20.0 fold as grade 4.
PMC5511775	M02002	Patient BMI at the time of ALT sample collection was calculated and BMI percentile was determined as described previously with obesity defined as ≥ 95th percentile.(42)
PMC5511775	M02003	For the COG AALL0232 cohort, ALT values were graded using the CTCAE version 4.0.
PMC5511775	M02004	ALT values between 1.0 ~ 3.0 fold of normal upper limit were assigned as grade 1, between 3.0 ~5.0 fold as grade 2, between 5.0 ~20.0 fold as grade 3, and > 20.0 fold as grade 4.
PMC5511775	M03000	During induction therapy, patients enrolled on the SJCRH Total XV or Total XVI protocols received asparaginase, prednisone, vincristine, daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, and thiopurine (Table 1, Figure S9).(39, 40) Total XV patients received native E. coli asparaginase (Elspar) at 10,000 units/m2 IM, three times weekly for six doses and Total XVI patients received a single dose of PEGylated E. coli asparaginase (Oncaspar) at 3,000 units/m2 IV.
PMC5511775	M03001	Patients on Total XV with day 19 MRD ≥ 5% received three additional doses of native E. coli asparaginase over a week’s period, and patients on Total XVI with day 15 MRD ≥ 1% received an additional dose of PEGylated E. coli asparaginase (Table 1, Figure S9).
PMC5511775	M03002	Post-induction samples for ALT and total bilirubin measurement were drawn on day 46 (Total XV) and on day 42 (Total XVI) from the start of remission induction therapy, regardless of clinical suspicion of hepatotoxicity (Figure S9).
PMC5511775	M03003	ALT and total bilirubin were also measured at diagnosis (pre-induction therapy), before the patients were exposed to methotrexate or asparaginase (Figure S9).
PMC5511775	M04000	During induction therapy, patients enrolled on COG AALL0232 received vincristine, daunorubicin, dexamethasone or prednisone, and PEGylated E. coli asparaginase.(43)
PMC5511775	M04001	Patients with day 29 MRD between 1% and 25% received extended induction consisting of additional doses of vincristine, daunorubicin, dexamethasone or prednisone, and PEGylated E. coli asparaginase.
PMC5511775	M04002	During consolidation, patients received cytarabine, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, mercaptopurine, and PEGylated E. coli asparaginase (Table S7).
PMC5511775	M04003	Measurement of ALT levels was a required observation on COG AALL0232 on day 1 of induction and at the start of consolidation and was performed at other times at the discretion of the treating physician.
PMC5511775	M04004	Sites were required to report all grade 3 and higher ALT elevation.
PMC5511775	M07000	Male Balb/cJ mice (4-week-old) (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) received 1,500 IU/kg of PEGylated E. coli asparaginase by intraperitoneal injection twice weekly for 6 weeks.
PMC5511775	M08000	Univariate and multivariate linear regression was performed using a general linear model with R statistical software (version 2.13.2) to identify clinical risk factors associated with post-induction ALT levels as a continuous variable.
PMC5511775	M08001	For the COG AALL0232 replication cohort, associations between clinical risk factors and the frequency of grade > 2 hepatotoxicity were determined using Fisher’s exact test in R. The genome-wide association analysis between SNP genotypes and ALT was performed in PLINK 1.9 (https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink2) using linear or logistic regression as appropriate, adjusting for significant covariates and assuming an additive genetic model.(48)
PMC5511775	R00002	Patients enrolled on Total XV received mercaptopurine, whereas most on Total XVI received thioguanine; those on Total XV received pre-induction window therapy with methotrexate, whereas those on Total XVI did not (Table 1).
PMC5511775	R00003	In both protocols, patients with higher minimal residual disease (MRD) at day 15–19 of induction received additional asparaginase compared to those without.
PMC5511775	R01000	Overall, 715 patients were evaluable for post-induction ALT data in the discovery cohort (Table 2, Figure S1).
PMC5511775	R01001	By univariate analysis (Table S1), treatment protocol (Figure 1A), additional asparaginase during induction (Figure 1B), race group (Figure 1C), age (Figure 1D), body mass index (BMI) percentile (Figure 1E), and gender were associated with post-induction ALT levels.
PMC5511775	R01002	In multivariate analysis (Table 3), higher ALT levels were associated with Total XVI treatment protocol (P = 0.041), receiving additional induction asparaginase (P = 2.7×10−4), non-black race (P = 8.7×10−13 for whites and P = 2.6×10−7 for Hispanics), older age (P = 1.4×10−6), and higher BMI (P = 2.9×10−3).
PMC5511775	R01003	Race group accounted for 7.2% of the variability in ALT levels (Table 3).
PMC5511775	R01004	Focusing on the National Cancer Institute’s common toxicity criteria (CTCAE) categories of ALT toxicity, Total XVI patients had more grade 2–3 ALT elevations compared to Total XV patients (P = 5.8×10−3, Figure S2A).
PMC5511775	R02000	To identify genetic variants associated with post-induction ALT levels in the SJCRH discovery cohort, we used a multivariate linear regression model including treatment protocol, use of additional asparaginase doses, percentage of Northern European ancestry, West African ancestry and Native American ancestry, age, and BMI percentile as covariates along with genotypes.
PMC5511775	R02001	The strongest association (P = 2.5×10−8) with ALT levels was with the PNPLA3 rs738409 (C>G) I148M variant (Figure 2A, Table 4), a missense polymorphism known as a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for ALT in the general population.(10)
PMC5511775	R02002	The median ALT level for patients of CC, GC, and GG diplotypes was 35, 45, and 58 IU/L, respectively.
PMC5511775	R02003	When ALT was translated into CTCAE categories of ALT toxicity, the frequency of higher ALT grade (grade > 2) was 2.6%, 3.9% and 5.3% respectively among patients of CC, GC, and GG diplotypes (Figure S2B).
PMC5511775	R02004	The association of PNPLA3 rs738409 with ALT treated as a continuous variable was observed in both Total XV (P = 5.5×10−6) and Total XVI (P = 2.7×10−4) (Figure S3A), and differed within race groups (Figure 3A, Figure S3B).
PMC5511775	R02005	Interestingly, the minor allele frequency (MAF) of PNPLA3 rs738409 was highest among Hispanics (44.2%), followed by whites (23.1%), and lowest in blacks (13.1%) in our cohort, as observed in previous studies,(11) and followed the same trend as their post-induction ALT levels (Figure 3B).
PMC5511775	R03000	Because the impact of PNPLA3 rs738409 on ALT elevation differed by race (Figure 3A, Figure S3B), and because ALT levels differed among races in the same direction that the PNPLA3 rs738409 MAF did (Figure 3B), we questioned whether the association between race and ALT elevation was accounted for mostly by this variant.
PMC5511775	R03001	After adding PNPLA3 rs738409 genotype to a multivariate analysis for determinants of ALT levels, the PNPLA3 SNP accounted for 3.8% of ALT variability, and race group still remained an important risk factor (P = 3.7×10−11, 6.6×10−5 and 2.0×10−3 for whites, Hispanics and others vs. blacks, respectively), and explained 5.3% of the variability in ALT elevation after incorporating the PNPLA3 SNP (Table 3).
PMC5511775	R03002	Therefore, we performed three separate ancestry-specific GWAS among whites, blacks and Hispanics (Tables S2–S4) to identify additional possible race-specific genetic determinants of ALT, including the percentage of West African and Native American ancestries as covariates in the GWASs within blacks and Hispanics, respectively.
PMC5511775	R03007	In addition, when race structure was calculated with PCA and the first five principal components were used as covariates in each race-specific GWAS, the top SNPs and P values for association with ALT did not change substantially (Tables S2–S4), and PCA within blacks did not uncover any stratification among the patients carrying the different PIGV rs12748152 genotypes (Figure S4D).
PMC5511775	R04000	A total of 109 variants within the PNPLA3 gene were found in the SJCRH cohort, 65 of which had nominal P values of < 0.05 for their association with ALT, with 61/65 having the minor allele associated with higher ALT (Table S5).
PMC5511775	R04001	A gene-level GWAS including the same covariates as the single SNP GWAS (protocol, asparaginase dosage, percent ancestry, age, and BMI percentile) identified PNPLA3 as an overall detrimental gene for ALT levels (P = 0.0093), reflecting the collective impact of PNPLA3 variants.
PMC5511775	R05000	In the replication cohort AALL0232, ALT elevation was classified into grade > 2 vs. grade ≤ 2.
PMC5511775	R05001	Accounting for the significant covariates of age, race, gender, and the induction steroid (Table S6), PNPLA3 rs738409 was associated with the frequency of grade > 2 ALT elevations in the entire AALL0232 cohort (P = 0.024) (Figure S6) and when the analysis was limited to Hispanics (P = 0.01), thus independently replicating the polymorphism’s association.
PMC5511775	R06000	Because the PNPLA3 variant rs738409 has been previously linked to elevated ALT levels and to the development of hepatic steatosis in the general population,(13) its association with elevated ALT after remission induction therapy suggested that asparaginase may influence blood ALT levels through dysregulation of hepatic lipids.
PMC5511775	R06001	We confirmed that PEGylated E. coli asparaginase caused hepatic steatosis in mice, as evidenced by a doubling in Oil-red O (ORO) staining in livers of mice treated with the drug compared to control (Figure S7).

PMC5697442	A00000	Variable drug responses depend on individual variation in the activity of drug-metabolizing enzymes, including cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP).
PMC5697442	D03001	A significant increase of ALT was observed in steatosis (79.3 ± 26.3 U/l) and the NASH group (72.5 ± 16.5 U/l) compared with the control group (19.1 ± 2.8 U/l), which is consistent with previously reported elevated ALT in pediatric NAFLD (Molleston et al., 2014).
PMC5697442	D04000	Heritable genetic variations in CYP enzymes can significantly alter function of these enzymes.
PMC5697442	D09007	In summary, the distinct pattern of CYP activity alterations in adolescents with NASH compared with adults suggests the possibility of ontogenetic factors in the response to inflammatory disease for these CYP isoforms.
PMC5697442	D10000	Although pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated age-related differences in very young patients for some CYP activities, our present study demonstrates differences in response to disease in patients as old as 12–21 years, the age at which the activity of all CYP isoforms investigated was thought to be similar to adults (Hines, 2007).
PMC5697442	D10001	It is noteworthy that the ex vivo study was performed with human liver microsomes while the CYP activities in this pediatric study were evaluated in an intact physiologic condition.
PMC5697442	D10002	Therefore, the differences found between the two studies may reflect the differences in CYP activities in the different reaction environments.
PMC5697442	D11000	CYP-mediated drug metabolism in adolescents with NASH can decrease up to 80%, which creates the potential for an increased incidence of variable drug responses.

PMC5697442	M10002	For comparison, the mean difference of CYP activity comparing the steatosis or NASH groups to the control group was computed from a linear model with logarithmic transformed relative activity.
PMC5697442	R01000	Compared with the control group (17.7 ± 1.5 U/l), the NAFLD patients had a statistically significantly higher ALT level (79.3 ± 26.3 for steatosis and 72.5 ± 16.5 for NASH).
PMC5697442	R03004	Even though the pharmacokinetic curves of caffeine, losartan, and midazolam as well as their metabolites were differentiated among the normal, steatosis, and NASH groups, calculation of metabolic AUC ratios offset these changes, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4 was not significantly altered in adolescents with steatosis or NASH.
PMC5697442	R05000	A variance comparison of CYP activities was performed between the present pediatric study and a previous study in adults (Fisher et al., 2009).

PMC5994036	D02000	Our analysis shows no association between increased arginase activity and RA disease activity (DAS28 score).
PMC5994036	D02002	Alternatively, arginase activity may not elicit a significant effect on the RA pathogenesis per se, but may influence the induction of subclinical endothelial dysfunction in patients with RA.
PMC5994036	D02004	Interestingly, the disconnect was further supported by our observation that seronegative subjects had statistically significant elevated levels of SDMA and ArgMI compared with seropositive patients (Table ​(Table3),3), although the latter showed higher extraarticular disease manifestations.
PMC5994036	D03001	Among the methylated derivatives, ADMA, a potent endogenous inhibitor of NOS and a marker of endothelial dysfunction, has been shown by our group and others to serve as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events in the general population [14, 16].
PMC5994036	I01000	l-arginine is the common substrate of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and arginases [8].
PMC5994036	I01001	NOS catalyzes l-arginine to generate nitric oxide (NO) and l-citrulline, whereas arginases catalyze the conversion of l-arginine to l-ornithine and urea (Fig. 1a).
PMC5994036	I01002	Elevated arginase activity therefore can diminish the bioavailability of l-arginine by substrate competition and decrease NO production, which can lead to endothelial dysfunction [9, 10] and eventually result in adverse cardiovascular issues [11].
PMC5994036	M02000	We measured plasma arginase activity in 119 patients with RA and compared it with that of 148 age- and sex-matched control subjects.
PMC5994036	M02001	Plasma arginase activity was measured using the QuantiChrom Arginase Assay Kit (BioAssay Systems, Hayward, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PMC5994036	R05000	We measured plasma arginase activity in 119 patients with RA (Table ​(Table1)1) and compared it with that of 148 age- and sex-matched control subjects.
PMC5994036	R06000	Further analysis showed heightened arginase activity in a subgroup of 17 patients with RA with existing CVD compared with patients with RA without CVD (n = 101) (p = 0.048) (Fig. ​(Fig.3b).3b).
PMC5994036	R06001	Interestingly, elevated arginase activity did not show an association with traditional risk factors such as hypertension, type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, and smoking.
PMC6019644	D04007	In light of evidence that antibodies against citrullinated protein and peptides (ACPA) precede the clinical onset of RA by several years, have high specificity for RA at over 95%24,25 and that we previously observed antibodies characteristic of RA, including citrullinated and uncitrullinated peptides of the RA autoantigens in individuals with periodontitis3, the ability of C.curtum to degrade arginine via the arginine deiminase pathway and to produce substantial amounts of citrulline is of particular interest.
PMC6023477	R14000	In addition to karyotypically examining aneuploidy of chromosomes in cancer cells, iFISH is also uniquely capable of qualitatively and quantitatively co-detecting multiple tumor biomarkers’ expression and cytogenetic gene rearrangement, such as anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene [66] in adenocarcinomic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, as shown in Figure 3 (ALK-iFISH, Cytelligen, San Diego, CA, USA).
PMC6023477	R15002	Unlike conventional pathological biopsy routinely performed once to detect positivity of the therapeutic target (e.g., ALK, HER2, EGFR, etc.) on primary or metastatic lesions, continuously cytogenetic and/or phenotypic monitoring of dynamic target status on circulating carcinoma cells, such as the described ALK gene rearrangements, phenotypic protein expression of HER2, stem cell markers (CD133, CD44v6, EpCAM), immunotherapeutic marker PD-L1, and mesenchymal marker vimentin, etc.

PMC6075359	D00000	In the HCHS/SOL cohort, we found genome-wide significant associations of iron traits with four previously known loci (TF, HFE, FADS2/MYRF, TMPRSS6) and identified a potential novel iron locus (PPP1R3B).
PMC6075359	D01000	PPP1R3B is a subunit of the serine/threonine phosphatase, protein phosphatase-1 (PP1).
PMC6075359	D01001	PPP1R3B (originally called GL) targets PP1 to glycogen synthase in the liver, regulating glycogen storage.
PMC6075359	D14000	Our results show the generalization of previously reported associations between iron traits and TF, HFE, FADS2/MYRF, TMPRSS6, TFR2, NAT2, ABO and GAB3 to a Hispanic/Latino population.
PMC6075359	R01000	SNPs representing the previously reported TF, HFE, fatty acid desaturase 2 (FADS2)/ myelin regulatory factor (MYRF) and transmembrane protease, serine 6 (TMPRSS6) loci were associated with one or more iron traits at genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) (Table 2).
PMC6075359	R01001	An additional novel variant at the protein phosphatase 1, regulatory subunit 3B (PPP1R3B) locus was nearly genome-wide significant for TIBC (P = 7.44 × 10−8).
PMC6075359	R04000	The FADS2/MYRF locus.
PMC6075359	R12000	In the largest European meta-analysis, Benyamin et al. detected associations between iron traits and 11 loci [HFE (two independent variants), solute carrier family 40 (iron-regulated transporter), member 1 (SLC40A1), TF, transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2), transferrin receptor (TFRC), TMPRSS6, ABO, aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator like (ARNTL), FADS2, N-acetyltransferase 2 (arylamine N-acetyltransferase) (NAT2), testis expressed 14 (TEX14)] (6).
PMC6075359	R15000	We tested the lead variants from each iron-associated locus for associations with glycemic traits: rs6762719 for TF, rs1799945 for HFE, rs4841132 for PPP1R3B, rs174529 for FADS2/MYRF and rs855791 for TMPRSS6 (Table 5).
PMC6086450	A03001	Thus, different metabolic processes, potentially the immunoregulation by indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase-1 (IDO), which is involved in cancer development and progression supporting inflammatory processes in the tumor microenvironment and glutaminolysis, can serve as novel promising therapeutic targets in MM.
PMC6086450	D03000	Furthermore, kynurenine, which is converted from the essential aromatic amino acid tryptophan by the enzyme IDO1 plays an important role in several cellular functions.
PMC6086450	D03001	The activity of IDO and the activation of the kynurenine pathway, which is indirectly reflected by the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio, was elevated in NDMM patients.
PMC6086450	D03002	The IDO enzyme has been reported to be a key player in both cancer development and progression as it supports inflammatory processes in the tumor microenvironment, mediates immune tolerance to tumor antigens and suppresses T-cells and natural killer cells [26, 27].
PMC6086450	D05000	Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), which was enriched in healthy controls, is an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and is derived from methylation of arginine residues in proteins.
PMC6086450	R06000	The activation of the kynurenine pathway occurs when the activity of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase-1 (IDO1), which catalyzes the conversion of tryptophan to kynurenine, is increased [14, 15].
PMC6092577	M02000	Clinical and biochemical indices were determined for each patient, including the following: (1) liver and kidney function, including serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total bilirubin (TBIL), direct bilirubin (DBIL), albumin (ALB), globulin (GLB), creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and uric acid (UA); (2) lipid profiles, including triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL); (3) clotting function, including the prothrombin time (PT); and (4) virological indicators, including hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb), hepatitis Be antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis Be antibody (HBeAb), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb) and the HBV-DNA titers were determined for each patient.
PMC6098070	D04005	In addition to regulation of glycosylation, recent studies also showed that SPPL3 is involved in immune response, including NFAT activation [53] and regulation of NK cell maturation and cytotoxicity [54].
PMC6098070	D04006	Surprisingly, the activation of NFAT is not dependent on the proteolytic activity of SPPL3 [53].
PMC6098070	D04007	A recent study also showed that genetic variant nearby SPPL3 is associated with the levels of markers of inflammation [55], consistent with SPPL3’s reported role in immunity and inflammation.
PMC6098070	D04008	Of note, immune dysfunction has been thought to be an important contributor to MDD [56, 57].
PMC6098070	D04009	Our study suggests that SPPL3 may represent a novel risk gene for MDD.
PMC6142358	A02000	The multi-step analysis unveiled five new proteins most predictive of water T2: hepatocyte growth factor, receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3, bone sialoprotein 2, glucokinase regulatory protein and endothelial cell-specific molecule 1.
PMC6142358	D01000	Three proteins were most predictive of plasma water T2: hepatocyte growth factor, receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 (fms-like tyrosine kinase 3) and bone sialoprotein 2.
PMC6142358	D03000	The hepatic growth factor receptor, also known as MET, is part of a tyrosine kinase signaling complex that functions in cell growth and survival, angiogenesis and tissue regeneration
PMC6142358	D08000	The CART regression tree analysis for serum water T2 yielded two biomarkers: endothelial cell specific molecule 1 and glucokinase regulatory protein (GKRP).
PMC6142358	D09000	Glucokinase regulatory protein is a well-known inhibitor of glucokinase and a key regulator of liver glucose uptake and metabolism [62–65].
PMC6142358	R04000	As revealed by CART analysis, the final regression tree for plasma water T2 included three biomarkers: hepatocyte growth factor receptor, receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 (fms-like tyrosine kinase 3), and bone sialoprotein 2 (Fig. 3).
PMC6142358	R04001	The final regression tree for serum water T2 included two protein markers: endothelial cell-specific molecule 1 and glucokinase regulatory protein (Fig. 4).
PMC6150202	R14000	Thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) plays an important role in the metabolism of thiopurines used in IBD therapy, i.e., in keeping balance between active (non-methylated) and non-active (methylated) thiopurine metabolites.
PMC6150202	R14001	The proposed method allowed for the evaluation of three analytes (AZA, 6-MP, and 6-MMP) included in a detailed investigation of TPMT activity.
PMC6188484	M01003	Prior to GC-MS analysis, the following steps were completed: 1) mixed and vortexed 15μl urine and 10°C L-leucine-13C6 (0.02 mg/ml, internal standard solution); 2) added 15μl urease into the mixed solution to degrade the urea at 37 °C for 60 minutes; 3) extracted the mixture successively using 240I1/4l and 80I1/4l of ice-cold methanol; 4) vortexed the obtained mixture for 30 seconds and then conducted centrifugation (at 4 °C, 14000 rpm x5 minutes); 5) at room temperature, transferred 224ul supernatant into a glass vial for vacuum drying; 6) derivatized the obtained dried metabolic extract using 30μl methoxyamine (20 mg/ml) at 37 °C for 90 minutes; 7) added 30μl of N,O-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide with 1% trimethylchlorosilane into the obtained dried metabolic extract; 8) heated the mixture at 70 °C for 60 minutes to obtain trimethylsilyl derivatives; 9) after derivatization and cooling to room temperature, added 1.0μl derivative into the GC-MS system.
PMC6193488	A00001	Platelets and coagulation proteases, interacting with circulating cells and in different vascular beds, modify several complex pathologies including atherosclerosis.
PMC6193488	A03000	Coagulation proteases, fibrin(ogen) and thrombus form ation: The role of factor (F) XI in thrombosis including the lower margins of this factor related to safe and effective antithrombotic therapy needs to be established; FXI is a key regulator in linking platelets, thrombin generation, and inflammatory mechanisms in a renin-angiotensin dependent manner; however, the impact on thrombin-dependent PAR signaling needs further study; the fundamental mechanisms in FXIII biology and biochemistry and its impact on thrombus biophysical characteristics need to be explored; the interactions of red cells and fibrin formation and its consequences for thrombus formation and lysis need to be addressed.
PMC6193488	A04001	The role of protease-activated receptor (PAR)-4 vis á vis PAR-1 as target for antithrombotic therapy merits study; ongoing trials on platelet function test-based antiplatelet therapy adjustment support development of practically feasible tests; risk scores for patients with atrial fibrillation need refinement, taking new biomarkers including coagulation into account; risk scores that consider organ system differences in bleeding may have added value; all forms of oral anticoagulant treatment require better organization, including education and emergency access; laboratory testing still needs rapidly available sensitive tests with short turnaround time.
PMC6193488	A05000	Pleiotropy of coagulation proteases, thrombus resolution and ischaemia-reperfusion: Biobanks specifically for thrombus storage and analysis are needed; further studies on novel modified activated protein C-based agents are required including its cytoprotective properties; new avenues for optimizing treatm ent of patients with ischaemic stroke are needed, also including novel agents that modify fibrinolytic activity (aimed at plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor.
PMC6193488	R113001	One promising drug candidate currently in phase II clinical studies for treatment of ischaemic stroke is the activated protein C (APC) variant 3K3A-APC.221 APC provides natural anticoagulant function by inactivating the coagulation cofactors Va and VIIIa.
PMC6193488	R113002	In addition, APC conveys direct effects on cells that involve multiple receptors including PAR1, PAR3, and the endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR).222 Depending on the cell type and cell stress involved, these cellular activities of APC, collectively referred to as ‘APC’s cytoprotective activities’, can be characterized as antiapoptotic and anti-inflammatory activity, beneficial alterations of gene expression profiles, protection of endothelial barrier function and regenerative activities.
PMC6193488	R114000	Studies have shown beneficial effects of APC in rodent stroke models.223
PMC6193488	R114001	The use of molecularly engineered APC variants with altered selectivity profiles to rodent stroke models, such as the 3K3A-APC variant with minimal anticoagulant activity but normal cytoprotective activities, demonstrated that the beneficial effects of APC primarily require its cytoprotective activities but not its anticoagulant activities.
PMC6193488	R115000	Recent insights into the molecular mechanisms for APC’s cytoprotective activities identified noncanonical PAR1 and PAR3 activation by APC that give rise to novel tethered ligands capable of inducing biased cytoprotective signaling as a key distinction from the traditional canonical thrombin-mediated PAR1 and PAR3 signaling that generally results in prohaemo-static and proinflammatory effects.224 Based on the available data, the consensus model for APC’s cytoprotective activities involves the binding of APC to the EPCR which permits APC-mediated noncanonical activation of PAR1 at Arg46 and PAR3 at Arg41 resulting in the initiation of biased signaling and the corresponding cytoprotective effects.
PMC6193488	R117003	Protein C is also sensitive to VKAs as it contains a GLA domain that is involved in binding of negatively charged phospholipid vesicles required for APC’s anticoagulant activity, binding to EPCR required for efficient protein C activation and APC’s cytoprotective effects on cells.
PMC6193488	R119001	With the notion that APC induces non-canonical activation of PAR1 and PAR3, biased signaling, and the integration of PAR signaling based on homo- and hetero-dimer formation, the realm of possibilities for specialized signaling variations has grown exponentially.
PMC6193488	R120001	The standard of care for acute ischaemic stroke now involves IV alteplase (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator [tPA]) within 4.5 hours, followed by antiplatelet treatm ent (acetylsalicylic acid or clopidogrel) 24 hours after infusion of thrombolytics, to avoid excess risk of intracerebral haemorrhage.225,226 The major goal of thrombolytic treatm ent is to rapidly establish oxygenated blood flow to limit brain damage.
PMC6193488	R140000	Activated protein C mutants are increasingly interesting for their cytoprotective properties (e.g. in the management of patients with ischaemic stroke).
PMC6193488	R16002	C5 nevertheless is crucial for outer membrane phosphatidylserine exposure and activating TF prothrombotic activity, as previously also demonstrated for complement fixing antibodies causing thrombotic complications in stem cell therapy.51 Protein disulphide isomerase pathways are necessary for affinity maturation of TF and phosphatidylserine exposure but is not sufficient to render MV-associated TF fully prothrombotic.52 Complement-dependent release of MV from monocytes in LPS-stimulated whole blood produces TF which due to its high affinity is already in complex with its ligand FVIIa.
PMC6193488	R161000	Further studies on novel modified activated protein C-based agents are required including its cytoprotective properties.
PMC6193488	R41001	In contrast to humans, mice have two kininogen genes and ablation of kininogen 1 (mkng1–/– mice) protects from experimental arterial thrombosis without causing bleeding.106 Consistently, a patient with plasma kininogen activity of less than 1% did not bleed.106 While serine proteases are targetable by small molecule inhibitors that bind into the enzymatic pocket, strategies for interference with HK or HK expression should be further investigated.
PMC6193488	R55000	Undertake further studies on FXI induced increased thrombin production and PAR-mediated cell signaling; these should consider upregulation of PK-mediated activation of the bradykinin pathways; population-based cohorts or large trials with anticoagulants should be explored for signals of blood pressure lowering effects or changes in incident CVD linked to FXI or other clotting protease activity.
PMC6193488	R89002	VKAs exert their anticoagulant effect by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase, which requires absorption from the gut into the systemic circulation, whereas NOACs are only partially absorbed from the gut and residual drug can exert effects locally on the GI mucosa leading to bleeding.174,179,182
PMC6247389	A00000	Paraoxonase-1 (PON1) and lipoprotein phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) may exert an important protective role by preventing the oxidative transformation of high- and low-density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL, respectively).
PMC6247389	A00005	Arylesterase, but not lactonase or Lp-PLA2 activities, was inversely associated with TD2M after adjusting for potential confounding factors such as age, sex, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, and lipoprotein subclasses (odds ratio = 3.389, 95% confidence interval 1.069–14.756).
PMC6247389	A00006	Marked difference between controls and T2DM subjects emerged from the analyses of the associations of the three enzyme activities and lipoprotein subclasses.
PMC6247389	A00007	Arylesterase was independently related with large HDL-C and small intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol (IDL-C) in controls while, along with lactonase, it was related with small low-density lipoprotein cholesterol LDL-C, all IDL-C subspecies, and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) in T2DM (p < 0.05 for all).
PMC6247389	A00009	Our study showed that T2DM subjects have lower levels of PON1-arylesterase compared to controls and that T2DM occurrence may coincide with a shift of PON1 and Lp-PLA2 towards the more proatherogenic lipoprotein subclasses.
PMC6247389	C00000	In conclusion, the present community-based population study showed that PON1-arylesterase activity is inversely associated with T2DM.
PMC6247389	C00001	Notably, we found that this relationship was independent of several confounding factors, including the lipoprotein subclasses that may carry PON1 itself.
PMC6247389	C00002	Our study also showed that the occurrence of T2DM could coincide with a shift of PON1 and Lp-PLA2 towards the more proatherogenic lipoprotein subclasses.
PMC6247389	C00003	The existence of a possible cause-effect link between decreased PON1 activities and its redistribution across lipoprotein subclasses required further investigations.
PMC6247389	D00000	In overall agreement with previous reports [13, 14, 23], our study showed that PON1-arylesterase, but not PON1-lactonase or Lp-PLA2, activity was decreased in T2DM patients compared to controls.
PMC6247389	D00002	The subsequent analysis of the association between the enzyme activities and lipoprotein subclasses revealed that (1) Lp-pLA2 was associated with small LDL-C, large IDL-C, and VLDL-C in the T2DM group but not in controls and (2) arylesterase was associated only with large/medium HDL-C in controls and only with some of the more proatherogenic ApoB lipoproteins in T2DM subjects.
PMC6247389	D02000	One of the few certainties in this confusing landscape is the intimate interaction between the lipoprotein environment surrounding PON1 or Lp-PLA2 and their activities [9, 27, 42]; these two accessory proteins are anchored to lipids and some apolipoproteins which also coordinate and modulate their catalytic activity [43].
PMC6247389	D02001	Recent improvements in separation techniques have highlighted that PON1 and Lp-PLA2 have a preferential, but not exclusive, distribution within HDL or LDL subclasses [20, 21, 23, 26, 44].
PMC6247389	D02002	This may depend on the “broad” affinity of the enzymes with various apolipoproteins and lipid subspecies that may reach the most suitable combination in the small HDL3 in the case of PON1 and small LDL for Lp-PLA2.
PMC6247389	D02003	It was also demonstrated that when the composition and spatial location of phospholipid moiety or apolipoproteins such as APO A1 and A2 and Apo E change (as during HDL maturation), also the distribution of PON1 across HDL subclasses varies as well [21, 22, 39].
PMC6247389	D02004	This “flux” of PON1 was observed to occur during HDL maturation, but it might be a phenomenon also associated with diseases typically featuring quantitative and qualitative abnormalities of lipid/apolipoprotein profiles, such as T2DM
PMC6247389	D02006	In the present study, we focused on T2DM, not only because of the association with the aforementioned qualitative change in lipoproteins but also for the cumulating reports showing a disease-related alteration in PON1 and Lp-PLA2 activities [13, 21, 23].
PMC6247389	D03000	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated whether the inverse association between arylesterase and T2DM is independent from such large spectrum of lipoprotein subclasses.
PMC6247389	D03003	Our finding is overall consistent with the work of Dullaart et al., with a meaningful difference: the strength of the association largely decreased upon controlling for large and medium HDL-C and small IDL-C (from OR = 5.522, 95% CI 1.489–20.426 to OR = 3.389, 95% CI 1.069–14.756), suggesting that the distribution of PON1 in lipoprotein subclasses can, in part, explain the observed relationship.
PMC6247389	D03005	Arylesterase, although referred as one of the two promiscuous activities of PON1 (the other is paraoxonase), is more frequently measured in epidemiological studies compared to the putative physiological activity, lactonase [28, 46, 47].
PMC6247389	D03006	Arylesterase is minimally influenced by some prevalent PON1 genetic polymorphisms, discloses low interindividual variability, and is regarded as a better surrogate of PON1 concentration than the other two activities [47].
PMC6247389	D03007	Furthermore, regarding the lack of significant association between Lp-PLA2 and T2DM, data on the association with T2DM and related CV complications are highly variable and divergent
PMC6247389	D03008	[16, 17, 21], and besides, it is still not clear whether high/low levels of Lp-PLA2 are beneficial or detrimental for human health
PMC6247389	D03010	Some authors suggest that the possible explanation of this recurrent paradox may be related to the distribution of Lp-PLA2 among lipoprotein classes and subclasses [49].
PMC6247389	D03011	In particular, Lp-PLA2 might be anti-inflammatory when is complexed with HDL, whereas it is proinflammatory (the hydrolysis of oxidized lipids generates the cytotoxic lysophosphatidylcholine
PMC6247389	D03012	[9]) when it resides in ApoB-containing lipoproteins [9, 32, 50].
PMC6247389	D04000	In order to address the possibility of influence of the diabetic state over the distribution of Lp-PLA2 and PON1 activities across lipoprotein subspecies, we assessed the simple and adjusted correlation coefficients separately in controls and T2DM subjects.
PMC6247389	D04001	The finding that Lp-PLA2 was associated to the small LDL-C, one of the most important risk factors of CVD, is consistent with some studies on isolated lipoproteins showing that in healthy people [51, 52] and, mostly, in diabetics [21], the enzyme is preferentially located in this LDL subclass.
PMC6247389	D04002	Failure in detecting a significant correlation of Lp-PLA2 with small LDL-C in controls may be the result of the low levels of this subclass in this group (Table 2).
PMC6247389	D04003	Alternatively, it can also be hypothesized that ApoB lipoproteins may be enriched in active Lp-PLA2 in T2DM patients and this could reflect in a further selective increase in proatherosclerotic potentials of these particles.
PMC6247389	D05000	Regarding PON1, the disappearance and appearance of association with large/medium HDL-C and the more proatherogenic ApoB lipoproteins, respectively, in T2DM csubjects may have two, not necessarily antithetic, explanations.
PMC6247389	D06001	Within this assumption, the lack of correlation between arylesterase and large/medium HDL-C in the T2DM group may be the result of the marked decrease in the concentration of these subclasses (Table 2) and, thus, of the fraction of PON1 complexed with these particles.
PMC6247389	D06002	On the other hand, the exclusive association of arylesterase and lactonase with large/medium IDL, small LDL, and VLDL among T2DM patients might simply reflect the concomitant increase in the levels of these lipoproteins.
PMC6247389	D06003	As a proof of concept, PON1 has been detected within VLDL, VLDL remnants (i.e., large IDL), and small LDL in healthy individuals [19], but not in a sufficient amount to significantly contribute in arylesterase/lactonase total serum activities.
PMC6247389	D07000	It can be also speculated that the redistribution of PON1 among HDL subclasses is caused by the disease itself.
PMC6247389	D07001	In T2DM patients, PON1 is still bound in HDL, as suggested by the strong correlation between arylesterase and total HDL-C, but most likely, it is more evenly distributed among the subspecies of this lipoprotein compared to controls.
PMC6247389	D07002	Besides, it has been reported that glycation and oxidation of HDL or directly of PON1 occurring in T2DM may cause the detachment of the enzyme from its host and, as consequence, affect its activity [53].
PMC6247389	I04000	To address this still open question, the present population-based study sought to determine the link of T2DM with PON1 and Lp-PLA2 activities and, most importantly, to evaluate whether the disease might affect the distribution of these two enzymes across lipoprotein subclasses.
PMC6247389	M05000	Arylesterase and lactonase activities of PON1 and Lp-PLA2 activity in serum were measured by UV-VIS spectrophotometric assays in a 96-well plate format by using a Tecan Infinite M200 microplate reader (Tecan Group Ltd., Switzerland).
PMC6247389	M06000	Arylesterase activity was measured by using phenylacetate as substrate [31].
PMC6247389	M07000	Lactonase activity was assessed using gamma-thiobutyrolactone (TBL) as substrate, and Ellman's procedure was used to spectrophotometrically monitor the accumulation of free sulfhydryl groups via coupling with 5,5-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid)
PMC6247389	M08000	Lp-PLA2 was assessed by using 2-thio PAF as substrate, which is hydrolyzed by the enzyme in sn-2 position, and the consequent formation of free thiols was detected by Ellman's procedure.
PMC6247389	M11000	Since the distribution of arylesterase, lactonase, and Lp-PLA2 analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was skewed, the values were log transformed in order to approximate a normal distribution before being analyzed by parametric tests.
PMC6247389	R01000	Among the three serum enzyme activities assessed in this study, only PON1-arylesterase exhibited a significant change between groups.
PMC6247389	R01001	More specifically, as compared to controls, arylesterase was significantly (p < 0.001) decreased by 20% in participants with T2DM (78 ± 25 vs. 99 ± 31 kU/L) (Figure 1(a)).
PMC6247389	R01002	In contrast, either lactonase (p = 0.220) or Lp-PLA2 (p = 0.280) was not significantly different between the two groups (Figures 1(b) and 1(c)).
PMC6247389	R02000	In order to check whether the observed decrease in arylesterase activity was influenced by confounding factors of PON1 such as age and gender, we compared this activity between subgroups of 85 controls and 85 diabetics with similar age and prevalence of women/men (Supplementary Table 1).
PMC6247389	R02001	From this analysis, it emerged that the difference in arylesterase was less marked than that found in the whole sample (11%), but still significant (p = 0.003).
PMC6247389	R03000	The quantification of lipoprotein subfraction distribution was carried out on a subsample, Lipoprint, including 202 controls and 90 T2DM subjects, in order to (1) identify additional potential confounders of the association between arylesterase activity and T2DM and (2) explore the effect of T2DM on the distribution of PON1 activities and Lp-PLA2 on lipoprotein subclasses.
PMC6247389	R03002	Arylesterase, lactonase, and Lp-PLA2 activities also followed a similar trend, with only arylesterase showing a significant (p < 0.001) decrease in diabetics compared to controls (75 ± 20 vs. 96 ± 31 kU/L) (Supplementary Table 2).
PMC6247389	R05000	The above results along with the reports showing that PON1 reside in various lipoprotein subclasses [20, 23] prompted us to consider their relative serum concentration as possible confounders of the observed relationship between arylesterase and T2DM.
PMC6247389	R05001	To address this hypothesis, we first examined the association between this PON1 activity and lipoprotein subclasses in the whole population sample (Table 3).
PMC6247389	R06000	We next performed multivariable logistic regression to evaluate whether the independent correlates of arylesterase that emerged from the previous analysis could influence the association between this activity and T2DM (Figure 2).
PMC6247389	R06001	This analysis showed that low arylesterase (i.e., activity level in the lower quartile) confirmed the inverse association between this activity and T2DM that emerged from between-group comparison (Figure 1(a)).
PMC6247389	R07000	To investigate the possible effect of T2DM on the distribution of PON1-arylesterase, PON1-lactonase and Lp-PLA2 across lipoprotein subclasses, we measured the correlation between these variables separately in both controls and T2DM subjects Table 4.
PMC6247389	R07003	The pattern changed among DM patients, where the correlations persisted for total cholesterol and HDL-C (p < 0.05 for both), small LDL-C (p < 0.05), all three IDL-C subclasses (p < 0.01 for all), and VDL-C (p < 0.01).
PMC6251544	M06000	For the replication study in the Japanese population, selected SNPs were genotyped in cases from Japanese replication sets using the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based Invader assay (Third Wave Technologies, Madison, WI) (51).
PMC6256731	M06000	Identification of HPV-derived DNA was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of HPV gene sequences.
PMC6276579	I01000	Two genomewide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses of 25(OH)D concentrations inpopulations of European ancestry have been conducted identifying loci including group-specificcomponent (vitamin D binding protein) gene (GC), nicotinamide adeninedinucleotide synthetase 1 gene(NADSYN1)/7-dehydrocholesterol reductase gene(DHCR7), vitamin D 25-hydroxylase gene (CYP2R1), andvitamin D 24-hydroxylase gene (CYP24A1).
PMC6293533	R09000	We selected the following environmental factors for RDA analysis: BMI, AGE, ALT, AST, GLU, TG, TCHO, HDL, LDL, UREA, CR, and UA.
PMC6293533	R15000	The 16 environmental factors selected for RDA analysis in the quadriplegia and paraplegia groups were as follows: BMI, ALT, AST, GLU, TG, TCHO, HDL, LDL, UREA, CR, UA, AGE, COURSE, CRP, NBD score, and defecation time.
PMC6293533	R18000	Lachnoclostridium was negatively correlated with HDL (Pearson r = − 0.329, p = 0.031) and positively correlated with AST (Pearson r = 0.305, p = 0.047), UA (Pearson r = 0.358, p = 0.018) and CR (Pearson r = 0.403, p = 0.007).
PMC6296511	D03000	We found TRAP5 to be associated with lower risk of HF hospitalization among participants with CKD after adjustment for age, eGFR and baseline HF.
PMC6296511	D03001	TRAP5 is a metalloenzyme found in osteoclasts and macrophages, known to be resistant to inhibition by tartrate and activated in acidic conditions.[37]
PMC6296511	D03004	It is interesting to note that CD109, a protein found in osteoclast precursors,[42] as well as activated platelets and T-cells,[43] was associated with lower risk of heart failure among CKD participants than among non-CKD participants, (p-value for CKD interaction = 0.049).
PMC6298799	A00000	Statins, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are considered the first line treatment of hyperlipidemia to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.
PMC6298799	I00003	Inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in the hepatocytes leads to the upregulation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in cell membrane of hepatocytes to maintain cholesterol homeostasis in the liver cells.
PMC6298799	I00004	The uptake of LDL by the liver leads to a decrease in LDL levels in the plasma.
PMC6314687	C01000	The targeted oxylipin panel offers broad coverage of lipid mediators and pathway markers generated from enzymatic COX, LOX, CYP, and non-enzymatic oxidation pathways.
PMC6316856	M02000	Serum glucose, HbA1c, triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL and HDL-cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γGT), creatinine, uric acid, vitamin D, folic acid, ferritin, c-reactive protein, thyroxin and thyroid-stimulating hormone were measured in a certified clinical laboratory, using standard protocols.
PMC6336684	D00000	In an effort to identify CXCR4 effector proteins involved in cellular migration and invasion, we performed SILAC proteomics analysis and identified PI4KIIIα as one of the proteins whose expression is tightly linked to CXCR4 in the prostate cancer cell line PC3.
PMC6336684	D00001	Here we have characterized the novel cross-talk between CXCR4 and PI4KIIIα, and revealed that both proteins localize to lipid rafts together, participating in cancer cell invasion.
PMC6336684	D00002	Our studies also conclude that CXCR4 does not directly bind PI4KIIIα, but interacts through PI4KIIIα adaptor proteins, EFR3 and TTC7.
PMC6336684	D00004	EFR3 and TTC7 interaction with PI4KIIIα is evolutionarily conserved (34, 35), where EFR3B is a peripheral membrane protein targeted to PM through a palmitoylated anchor (36), which interacts with soluble adaptor protein TTC7 bound PI4KIIIα.
PMC6336684	D00005	Structural studies demonstrate that TTC7 binds with both EFR3 and PI4KIIIα (26), and membrane anchored EFR3 serves as a docking site for this complex in PM.
PMC6336684	D00006	Binding studies demonstrate highly specific interaction between CXCR4 and both EFR3B and TTC7B (Figure 3 and ​and4).4).
PMC6336684	D01000	Among phosphatidylinositol 4 kinases, PI4KIIIα has been demonstrated to be critical for maintenance of PI4P pools in PM (23, 40), where it serves as a major precursor for the bulk of PI(4,5)P2 and, subsequently, for PI(3,4,5)P3.
PMC6336684	D02000	PI4KIIIα activity has been shown to be a critical determinant of plasma membrane identity by maintaining the levels of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2.
PMC6336684	D02001	Embryonic fibroblasts lacking PI4KIIIα showed impairment of PI4P and PI(4,5)P2 production at plasma membrane and relocation of several of plasma membrane PI4P/PI(4,5)P2-binding proteins to internal compartments (35).
PMC6336684	D02002	Our data indicate that PI4KIIIα activity has additional functions in prostate cancer cells, where PI4P highly localizes to invasive projections in CXCR4 overexpressing cells thereby contributing to the invasiveness of cancer cells (Figure 5).
PMC6336684	D02003	In support of this hypothesis, we show that PI4KIIIα knockdown causes a sever defect in in vitro invasion without a significant alteration in cell proliferation.
PMC6336684	D02004	Our data from the cellular invasion assay also demonstrate that PI4KIIIα has a broader role on cellular invasion as its knockdown significantly inhibited multiple members of chemokine mediated PC3 cell invasion (Figure 7).
PMC6336684	D03000	In conclusion, in this study we assign a novel role of the chemokine receptors in recruiting PI4KIIIα activity for cancer cell invasion (Figure 7).
PMC6336684	D03001	By doing so, CXCR4 regulates PI4P production on the plasma membrane via interacting with cellular PI4KIIIα machinery.
PMC6336684	I01000	Phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) phosphates (PIPs), or phosphoinositides (PIs), are cellular phospholipids phosphorylated at 3, 4 and/or 5 positions on the myo-inositol ring by several types of kinases specific to each position.
PMC6336684	I01009	The phosphatases, which dephosphorylate PIPs are fairly specific to each phosphate in the myo-inositol ring, and often localize to subcellular locations where their substrates are produced.
PMC6336684	I02000	In the present study we investigate the relationship between CXCR4 and PI4KIIIα activity in terms of biochemical characterization and consequences to cancer cell invasion and metastasis.
PMC6336684	M05000	In vitro PI4KIIIα lipid kinase assays were performed as described earlier (22).
PMC6336684	M05001	Post kinase assay the chloroform-extracted PI(4)P product was separated by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) in n-propanol-2M acetic acid (65:35 v/v).
PMC6336684	M05003	PI4KIIIα activity was set as one fold in control PC3 cells (PC3 scr and PC3 RFP) and compared with CXCR4 manipulated cells.
PMC6336684	M05004	In other prostate cancer cells PI4KIIIα activity was set as one fold in LNCaP cells and compared with activity of C4–2B and VCaP cells.
PMC6336684	M06001	Briefly, scr and PI4KIIIα siRNA transfected PC3 CXCR4 cells were cultured overnight in inositol-free cell type-specific medium and labeled for 24–48 h with 25 μCi/ml of myo-[2-3H] inositol in an inositol free medium following previously published protocols (32).
PMC6336684	M09000	CXCR4 overexpressing cells (~50% confluent) transfected with or without 100 nM PI4KIIIα siRNA for 6 hrs in duplicate 60-mm dishes were harvested 44 hrs later and seeded in 12 wells (1×104 cells/well) of a Cell-Bind 96-well, black culture plate in complete growth medium (RPMI-1640, 10% FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin).
PMC6336684	R01000	To determine the significance of CXCR4 and PI4KIIIα association in lipid rafts, we first assessed whether CXCR4 regulates PI4KIIIα expression in prostate cancer cells.
PMC6336684	R01001	Data from Western-blotting experiments in CXCR4-overexpressing cells showed approximately a 2-fold increase in PI4KIIIα levels vs. the control PC3 parent cell line (Figure 2A,B).
PMC6336684	R01002	Concordantly, CXCR4 knockdown cells had reduced expression of both PI4KIIIα and Sac1expression.
PMC6336684	R01003	QPCR analysis of PI4KIIIα and Sac1 did not show changes in gene expresssion between parental PC3 cells and CXCR4 manipulated cells (Supplementary figure 3) suggesting a post-transcriptional mode of PI4KIIIα protein elevation in CXCR4 overexpressing PC3 cells.
PMC6336684	R01004	Cycloheximide treatment demonstrated that both CXCR4 and PI4KIIIα protein expression were decreased in PC3-CXCR4 cells compared to control PC3 cell which have lowere levels of both proteins; thus the overexpressed CXCR4 stabilizes PI4KIIIα in PC3 CXCR4 cells.
PMC6336684	R01005	The levels of both CXCR4 and PI4KIIIα in these cells were downregulated upon cycloheximide treatment in a similar fashion, further suggesting a post-transcriptional mode of their celllular regulation (Supplementary figure 4).
PMC6336684	R01006	Recent studies have indicated that CXCR4 signaling regulates the translational machinary involved in mTORC1 signaling (31), suggesting that PI4KIIIα overexpression could be due to a translational mechanism involving CXCR4/mTORC1 signaling.
PMC6336684	R01007	To identify whether the greater protein levels of PI4KIIIα is accompanied by elevated lipid kinase activity, we immunoprecipitated PI4KIIIα from prostate cancer cells with anti-PI4KIIIα antibody and subjected the immunoprecipitates to in vitro lipid kinase activity using PtdIns as a substrate.
PMC6336684	R01008	In vitro lipid kinase assays also confirmed that PI4KIIIα kinase activity was similarly elevated ~ 2 fold in the CXCR4-overexpressing cells and reduced in CXCR4 knockdown cells (Figure 2C and H).
PMC6336684	R01009	SiRNA mediated knockdown of PI4KIIIα resulted in a large downregulation of PI4KIIIα and small downregulation of Sac1 (Figure 2D) without a change in PI4KIIIβ expression (Supplementary figure 5) in PC3 cells.
PMC6336684	R01010	PI4KIIIα knock down experiments resulted in loss of PI4KIIIα lipid kinase activity (Figure 2E).
PMC6336684	R01011	Comparison of PI4KIIIα and Sac1 protein expression among three PC cell lines, namely, LNCaP, C42B and VCaP, by WB showed higher expression in VCaP cells compared to LNCaP cells (Figure 2F) and in vitro lipid kinase activity is also similarly higher in VCaP cells (Figure 2G).
PMC6336684	R01012	Comparision of PI4KIIIα expression and in vitro lipid kinase activity between the prostate cancer cells (LNCaP and C4–2B) and PC3 scr show that the latter have higher PI4KIIIα expression and in vitro lipid kinase activity (Figure 2A, F and H).
PMC6336684	R01013	VCaP cells which are TMPRSS2-ERG fusion positive, where ERG factor was shown to regulate CXCR4 expression (17), had 3-fold higher PI4KIIIα lipid kinase activity vs. the other two PC cell lines (Figure 2G and H).
PMC6336684	R01014	The higher lipid kinase activity may be reflective of the more active state of the PI4KIIIα in VCaP cells, which may be dependent on the expression of accessory proteins which bind and translocate PI4KIIIα to the membrane.
PMC6336684	R02000	To further determine the role of PI4KIIIα activity in maintaining cellular PI4P levels, and the requirement of PI4P for the conversion to downstream PtdIns species, PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3, we monitored cellular PI profiles using our previously established procedures (32, 33).
PMC6336684	R02003	PtdIns profiles were significantly altered upon PI4KIIIα knockdown; as expected total PI4P levels were reduced suggesting the major role of PI4KIIIα in maintaining PI4P levels, whereas there is an unexpected increase in total PI(4,5)P2 levels.
PMC6336684	R02004	The minor PtdIns species PI(3,4)P2 was decreased whereas PI(3,4,5)P3 wasincreased (Table 1).
PMC6336684	R02005	These data suggest that PI4P synthetic processes in prostate cancer cells were complexly related with steady state levels of other PtdIns species, and knockdown of PM associated PI4KIIIα levels leads to significant alterations in the cellular PtdIns profiles.
PMC6336684	R03000	To further determine the mechanism of CXCR4 regulation of PI4KIIIα, first we determined whether the two proteins interact with each other.
PMC6336684	R03001	For this purpose, we performed tagged gene transfection followed by WB analysis; data show no direct interaction between PI4KIIIα and CXCR4 (Figure 3A).
PMC6336684	R03002	PI4KIIIα is localized to the inner plasma membrane through two adaptor proteins, EFR3B and TTC7B. EFR3B is a membrane bound protein and TTC7B is an adaptor protein which binds with both EFR3B and PI4KIIIα.
PMC6336684	R04000	To determine the functional significance of PI4KIIIα mediated CXCR4 regulation and its effect on cellular invasion, we determined PI4P localization in cells and performed in vitro cellular invasion studies.
PMC6336684	R05000	To determine the clinical significance of PI4KIIIα in prostate cancer progression, we extracted expression values for PI4KIIIα and Sac1 from NCBI data set GDS3289 of human PC tumor tissues.
PMC6336684	R05001	The analysis shows that PI4KIIIα expression is significantly higher and Sac1 is lower in PC metastasis compared to either localized PC or normal adjacent tissue (Figure 6A).
PMC6336684	R05002	No difference in the expression of either PI4KIIIα or Sac1 is found between low PIN and high PIN lesions in PC patients (Figure 6A).
PMC6345099	D04001	Except for Canavan disease, a genetic disorder characterized by toxic accumulation of N-acetyl aspartate caused by aspartoacylase inactivation (86), down regulation of this metabolite seems to be constant in clinical conditions that associate neuronal dysfunction, including epilepsy (87–89), multiple sclerosis (90), Alzheimer's disease (91, 92), schizophrenia (93, 94), stroke (95), brain injury (96, 97) and brain tumors (98, 99).
PMC6345099	D12000	Aspartate is a metabolite of the urea cycle, involved in gluconeogenesis, being derived from asparaginase.
PMC6345099	D12001	The concentration of this metabolite is decreased in malignant cells, being synthesized from oxaloacetate by aminotransferase activity (121).
PMC6345099	D14000	The identification of estrogen metabolites and 17-ketosteroids in the urine of patients with PRL-secreting adenomas is most likely to be due to decreased activity of 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 5α-reductase that occurs among these patients (66).
PMC6362922	D04003	Proteobacteria are pathobionts, meaning that they may expand as a result of a microbial imbalance and exert pathogenic effects on the host and are consistently reported enriched in IBD.31–33 Our CD patients with a complicated phenotype had high abundance of Proteobacteria, in accordance with the previous reports.
PMC6363070	I02000	Rifaximin, an oral non-systemic GI-targeted antibiotic, has in vitro activity against a variety of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.22-24 Binding of rifaximin to the β subunit of bacterial DNA-dependent RNA polymerase inhibits transcription and bacterial RNA synthesis.22,25 However, the mechanism of action of rifaximin may extend beyond its antimicrobial activity.
PMC6403054	I01000	The most useful biomarker to date, faecal calprotectin, has been shown to correlate with endoscopic and histopathologic remission with a sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 89%.9 It has been reported to predict relapse for those patients in remission, with both a sensitivity and a specificity of 69%.10 A number of other potential biomarkers have been proposed for UC including C-reactive protein11 levels in serum, along with myeloperoxidase12 and lactoferrin13 levels in faeces.
PMC6456665	R07001	Interestingly, they were harbored within more genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism: eight SNPs were located in seven carbohydrate metabolism genes including those encoding β-galactosidase, α-N-arabinofuranosidase, α-1, 2-mannosidase, rhamnulokinase, Rhamnogalacturonides degradation protein, β-galactosidase and D-lactate dehydrogenase (Table S9).
PMC6456665	R07002	These results may suggest an altered carbohydrate preference and a resulting different carbohydrate metabolism patterns in the gut bacteria of TB patients.
PMC6463278	M02001	For participants with GPA, a detailed disease history was obtained including antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) type by ELISA (proteinase-3 [PR3], myeloperoxidase [MPO], or negative), disease status determined by the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score for Wegener’s Granulomatosis20 (BVAS/WG; BVAS/WG > 0 indicates active disease and BVAS/WG = 0 indicates disease remission), and sinonasal damage according to the ear, nose, and throat items on the Vasculitis Damage Index (VDI)21.

PMC6489687	A00004	Conclusion: These findings provide valuable insight into the distinct clinicopathological features of MBC and indicate that select serum proteomic markers may help improve MBC management.
PMC6489687	D03003	Consequently, high expression levels of ALDH directly correlate with poor clinical outcome in patients with breast cancer, since cancer stem cell s have been implicated in breast tumor initiation, metastatic spread and recurrence (19).
PMC6489687	D06000	Aromatase (CYP19A1) is responsible for the transformation of androgen precursors into estrogens.
PMC6489687	D07000	Finally, four proteins were detected only in the MBC group and not in the control samples: actin-related protein 2/3 complex subunit 4 (ARPC4), dual specificity mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 4 (MP2K4), ectoderm-neural cortex protein 1 (ENC1), and matrix metalloproteinase-27 (MMP27).
PMC6489687	M05001	Aromatase ELISA kit was purchased from Fine Biotech (EH2665; Fine Test, Wuhan, Hubei, P. R. China).
PMC6489687	R02001	Serum aromatase (CYP19A1) concentrations in patients with MBC and healthy controls were measured using ELISA since CYP19A1 is an endoplasmic reticulum enzyme also detected in the serum.
PMC6498444	R09000	These 3 glycoside hydrolases predominantly originated from Prevotella copri (42 ± 11.1%, Figure S3B), supporting the hypothesis that loss of Prevotella strains following U.S. immigration drove loss of plant fiber degradation capability.
PMC6498444	R09001	We also observed a loss of GH5 and GH26 glycoside hydrolases from HmongThai to Hmong1st and U.S. controls, which indicates a loss of cellulose, beta-mannan and possible xyloglucan degradative potential.
PMC6499899	I02000	Indole is an important bacterial quorum signaling molecule exclusively catabolized from tryptophan by commensal bacteria that express tryptophanase [16].
PMC6503468	I02000	The majority of available tryptophan ismetabolized in mammaliansystems through the kynurenine pathway via the tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase(TDO) or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) enzymes (Figure S1).
PMC6507336	A00000	Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK) is a Ser/Thr kinase that inactivates mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase and serves a key role in aerobic glycolysis, which is a hallmark of cancer cells.
PMC6507336	A00001	The present study determined the PDK expression in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) tissues and sera to evaluate their applicability as a biomarker for CCA.
PMC6507336	A00002	Using proteomic analysis, PDK was revealed to be the most overexpressed mitochondrial protein in CCA tissues.
PMC6507336	A00003	Then, the expression of PDK isoforms in CCA tissues was examined in 15 CCA cases by immunohistochemistry.
PMC6507336	D01000	We also studied the serum PDK levels in normal controls, and patients with BBD and CCA.
PMC6507336	D01001	Until now, the PDK level in the serum or plasma has not been determined in healthy controls and patients with diseases.
PMC6507336	D01002	As PDK is a mitochondrial protein, it was surprising that PDK1, 2 and 3 were detected in the sera, especially in the sera of patients with CCA.
PMC6507336	M04006	The sections were washed in 1X PBS-T and incubated with 150 µl undiluted goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody with the EnVision System (Dako; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) for 1 h and the signal was developed with diamino-benzidine (Dako; Agilent Technologies, Inc.) for 5 min in the dark.
PMC6507336	R01000	To evaluate the expression of four PDK isoforms in CCA, immunohistochemistry was performed on 15 CCA tissues from patients containing cancerous and adjacent non-cancerous tissues.

PMC6531881	D00000	Our results suggest that the number of rounds of PCR and to a lesser degree the choice of DNA polymerase impact the analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequence data from bacterial communities.
PMC6531881	D01000	The observed sequencing error rates and alpha diversity metrics followed the manufacturers’ measurements of their polymerases’ fidelity (Fig. 1).
PMC6531881	D01005	However, in our experience and despite efforts to optimize the yield with the KAPA polymerase, the reactions typically had a high proportion of primer-dimer products and low yield of correctly sized products.
PMC6531881	D01007	Considering that polymerase development is an active area of commercial development with potential new polymerases becoming available, it is important for researchers to understand how changing the polymerase impacts downstream analyses for their type of samples.
PMC6531881	D03001	Beyond the imperfections of the best polymerases, sometimes difficult to lyse organisms require stringent lysis steps and low biomass samples require additional rounds of PCR.
PMC6531881	I02000	The influence that the choice of DNA polymerase has on the formation of PCR artifacts has not been well studied.
PMC6531881	I02001	There has been recent interest in how the choice of the hypervariable region and data analysis pipeline impact the sequencing error rate (15, 18,–20); however, these studies use the same DNA polymerase in the PCR step and implicitly assume that the rate of nucleotide misincorporation from PCR are significantly smaller than those from the sequencing phase.
PMC6531881	I02002	There has been more limited interest in the impact that DNA polymerase choice has on the formation of chimeras (23, 38).
PMC6531881	I02003	A recent study found differences in the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and chimeras between normal and high fidelity DNA polymerases (38).
PMC6531881	I02004	The authors of the study reduced the difference between two polymerases by optimizing the annealing and extension steps within the PCR protocol (38).
PMC6531881	I02005	Yet this optimization was specific for the community they were analyzing (i.e., captive and semicaptive red-shanked doucs) and assumed that if the two polymerases generate the same community structure that the community structure was correct.
PMC6531881	I03000	This study investigated the impact of choice of high fidelity DNA polymerase and the number of rounds of amplification on the formation of PCR artifacts using a mock community and human stool samples.
PMC6531881	I03002	We tested (i) the effect of the polymerase on the error rate of the bases represented in the final sequences, (ii) the fraction of sequences that appeared to be chimeras and the ability to detect those chimeras, (iii) the bias of preferentially amplifying one fragment over another in a mixed pool of templates, and (iv) intersample variation in community structure of samples amplified with the same polymerase across the amplification process.
PMC6531881	I03003	To characterize these factors, we sequenced a mock community of 8 organisms with known sequences and community structure and human fecal samples with unknown sequences and community structures.
PMC6531881	M02000	Five high fidelity DNA polymerases were tested, including AccuPrime (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), KAPA HIFI (Roche, IN, USA), Phusion (New England Biolabs, MA, USA), Platinum (ThermoFisher, MA, USA), and Q5 (New England Biolabs, MA, USA).
PMC6531881	M03000	Each PCR condition (i.e., combination of polymerase and number of rounds of PCR) was replicated four times for the mock community and one time for each fecal sample.
PMC6531881	R04000	With the exception of the sequence data generated using the KAPA polymerase, the ratios of the two Salmonella enterica V4 sequences from the mock community were lower than the expected ratio of 6:1.
PMC6531881	R05000	Because the variation in bias between polymerases and across rounds of PCR could be artificially inflated due to sequencing errors and chimeras, we analyzed the alpha and beta diversity of the mock community data at different phases of the sequence curation pipeline (Fig. 4).

PMC6562671	C00000	A polysaccharide lyase AlyP1400, with high activity against alginate substrate, has been purified from marine bacterium Pseudoalteromonas sp. 1400.
PMC6562671	C00001	This enzyme had a molecular mass at 23 KDa and revealed a broad pH range for high enzyme activity and thermo-stability with a bifunctional lyase activity for both poly-M and poly-G degradation.
PMC6562671	C00002	AlyP1400 efficiently diminished P. aeruginosa PA14 biofilms when combined with conventional antibiotic, as the biofilm thickness, biovolume and surface area were reduced after treatment with carbenicillin or ciprofloxacin combined with the lyase enzyme.
PMC6562671	D01000	Recently, alginate lyase activity received much attention, because the alginate enzymatic degradation expands the potential application of this polysaccharide, not only through the industrial applications, but also for curing life threatening infections
PMC6562671	D01002	Extracting alginate lyase enzymes from marine bacteria that possessed alginate depolymerization activity could shift chronic infection treatment strategies.
PMC6562671	D01004	This is due to the alginate lyase activity, which degrades the alginate to un-saturated uronic acid-containing oligosaccharides via β-elimination of 1,4-glycosidic [42,43].
PMC6562671	D01005	Targeting mucoid biofilms with the alginate lyase enzymatic activity can reduce viscosity in clinical strains, and in CF specimens, thereby increasing the phagocytosis activities and enhance the antipseudomonal antibiotics’ effects.
PMC6562671	D02000	Using the purified alginate lyase of Pseudoalteromonas sp. 1400 under static and dynamic conditions against P. aeruginosa biofilms on polystyrene and glass surfaces, it was revealed that AlyP1400 impaired biofilm development, compared to the non-treated biofilms and led to subsequent biofilm detachment.
PMC6562671	I03002	[29], DNase (NucB) that hydrolyzes the eDNA within the extracellular matrix [30], and glycoside hydrolase that hydrolyzes the biofilm exopolysaccharide [31] have all been shown to act against P. aeruginosa biofilm.

PMC6562671	M05000	Bacterial colonies with the highest lyase activity in the clear zone assay above (4.2) were selected for testing their alginolytic activity as follows: three milliliter overnight (16–18 h) bacterial culture (OD at 600 nm adjusted to 1.0) was inoculated into a 97 mL fermentation medium (selection medium with 1.8% sodium alginate) and incubated at 28 °C and 150 rpm for 24 h. After the fermentation and centrifugation for 30 min at 12,096× g at 4 °C, cell-free supernatants were filtered through 0.22 µm non-pyrogenic filters and kept at −20 °C.
PMC6562671	M07000	Alginate lyase activities were measured using an absorbance assay at the wavelength of 235 nm.
PMC6562671	M07001	The absorbance of sodium alginate solution was increased due to the formation of a carbon-carbon double bond at the end of the product generated from lyase-mediated cleavage of alginate.
PMC6562671	M10000	In order to extract sufficient quantities of lyase, we cultured isolate 1400 under different temperatures, covering the range of 10–45 °C, and pHs, covering the range of 4.0–10 in order to determine the optimum culture conditions to purify the enzyme.
PMC6562671	M10001	Both the total and specific alginate lyase enzyme activities were measured as described by Zhu and colleagues [59], and the temperature and pH resulting in the highest enzyme activities were utilized for the following purification procedures.
PMC6562671	M11000	Alginate lyase thermo-stability was determined by incubating the purified enzyme 60 µg protein/mL with sodium alginate (0.1%) in Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.0) at different temperature (10–45 °C).
PMC6562671	M12000	The purified alginate lyase was resolved on a 10% SDS separating gel using the SDS-PAGE analysis.
PMC6562671	M15000	After confirming PA14 alginate production and AlyP1400 alginate lyase activity on the alginate, the inhibitory effects of AlyP1400 with and without antibiotics was assessed against established biofilms formed in dynamic conditions.
PMC6562671	R00000	A total of 36 bacterial strains with alginate lyase activity were isolated after enrichment on bacterial agar plates containing sodium alginate and selected for 16S rRNA sequencing (GenBank accession numbers MK377259 through MK377294).
PMC6562671	R00009	The cell-free supernatant of medium that had been used to culture this strain contained a total alginolytic activity of 70.09 ± 1.72 U/mL (Figure 1a) and significantly (P < 0.0001) reduced sodium alginate solution viscosity to 2.23 ± 0.25 centipoise with 90.81% liquefaction after 24 h incubation (Figure 1a), while sodium alginate solution (the blank) viscosity was 24.28 ± 1.12 centipoise (Figure 1b).
PMC6562671	R00011	After covering the alginate agar plate with 1 M CaCl2 solution, enzymes acting on poly-mannuronate (poly-M) will show a white halo due to gelation of the degradation products caused by the reaction of lyase with poly-M. Meanwhile, poly-guluronate (poly-G) substrate will show a white ring, due to the depolymerization of alginate to uronic acid.
PMC6562671	R02000	Isolate 1400 was selected for subsequent enzyme purification and characterization because it demonstrated the best and highest alginate lyase activity as shown by having the largest clearance zone (Table 1) and enzyme production measured in U/mL (Figure 1a).
PMC6562671	R02001	First, we set to optimize the growth conditions (including temperature and medium pH), under which Pseudoalteromonas sp. 1400 produced the highest alginate lyase activity in the supernatant.
PMC6562671	R02006	On the other hand, Pseudoalteromonas sp. 1400 grown at pH 8.0 released the highest amount of alginate lyase with specific activity of 32.85 U/mg protein and 56.5 ± 0.71 U/mL total activity, whereas we noticed that the lowest specific enzyme activity (5.92 U/mg protein) was recorded at pH 5.0 and pH 6.0.
PMC6562671	R03000	Based on the optimal alginate lyase production conditions, we set to purify this enzyme (AlyP1400) from Pseudoalteromonas sp.
PMC6562671	R04001	During the first 120 minutes of purification time, no lyase activity was observed with the collected fractions through the bio-gel column chromatography eluate with 0.2 M sodium chloride.
PMC6562671	R05000	AlyP1400 was active for both poly-M and poly-G degradation, indicating that it is a bifunctional alginate lyase (data not shown).
PMC6562671	R06000	The AlyP1400 band identified in the SDS-PAGE with alginate lyase activity was excised, subjected to trypsin digestion and analyzed by LC-MS/MS.
PMC6571926	D03000	Formation of GTP-derived urinary metabolites: Absorbed EGC, either directly from the GTP supplement, or from the hydrolysis of EGCG, likely underwent COMT-mediated methylation followed by uridine 5’-diphospho-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)-mediated glucuronidation to form methyl epigallocatechin glucuronide (Vu).
PMC6571926	D03001	Similarly, absorbed EC was metabolized by COMT-mediated methylation and sulfotransferase (SULT)-mediated sulfation reactions to form methyl epicatechin sulfate (IVu).
PMC6585303	R13000	To investigate for a special immune relationship in patients with SLE with their candidate pathobionts, we electrophoretically separated the components in extracts of eight monocultured RG strains (online supplementary table 5) after treatment with lysozyme and endonuclease.
PMC6585303	R13001	Immunoblots revealed that many patients with lupus and healthy adult controls had IgG reactivity with antigenic bands, common to a range of RG strains (figure 2A–D), and these were protease-sensitive (figure 2E).
PMC6585303	R24000	For investigations of the potential immune epitope features of the RG2 strain, we performed immunoblots with lupus IgG that detected high levels of oligomeric bands in the LG3 pool in the range of ~20–30 kDa protein markers, which resembled the reactivity pattern of protease-resistant antigens in the RG2 extract that were absent in other RG strains (figure 4A–D).
PMC6585303	R24001	In fact, preincubation of a lupus serum with LG3 at 2 µg/mL inhibited all immunoblot reactivity with the oligomeric antigenic bands in the LG2 and LG3 pools and with the nuclease-treated RG2 extract, but did not affect the IgG reactivity with the protease-sensitive bands (figure 4E, F).
PMC6590206	M04000	The sequences of microbial rRNA that can reflect the flora composition and diversity were used as targets, and sample-specific barcode sequences were used for PCR amplification of the variable regions of the 16S rRNA gene (Q5 HiFi DNA polymerase; NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA).
PMC6627068	A00001	Cystathionine β-synthase deficiency (CBS), an inborn error of metabolism, is associated with vascular thromboembolism, the major cause of morbidity and mortality in affected patients.
PMC6627068	A00003	We used label-free mass spectrometry for quantification of changes in serum proteomes in CBS-deficient patients (n = 10) and gender/age-matched unaffected controls (n = 14), as well as in patients with cardioembolic (n = 17), large-vessel (n = 26), or lacunar (n = 25) ischemic stroke subtype.
PMC6627068	D00000	We used label-free mass spectrometry to identify serum proteins whose levels were affected by CBS deficiency and ischemic stroke subtypes.
PMC6627068	D00001	We found that many of the proteins affected by CBS deficiency were also affected in ischemic stroke patients.
PMC6627068	D00002	Our results suggest that CBS deficiency and ischemic stroke, particuraly the cardioembolic stroke subtype, share similar molecular mechanisms.
PMC6627068	D01001	Specifically, the identification of CBS deficiency-responsive proteins that are involved in acute phase response (e.g., SAA1, SERPINA1, ORM2, AHSG), immune response (e.g., IGHD, IGJ, APC, C4BPA, IGHV3-72, IGK, IGKV2D-24), blood coagulation (e.g., FBLN1, KNG, APOH, C1S, C1R, CF1, CBP2, SERPINC1, SERPINF2, SERPIND1, F2, F13B), and lipid/cholesterol transport/metabolism (APOC1, APOC3, APOA1, APOM) supports this conclusion.
PMC6627068	D03000	Comparisons of proteomes between CBS deficiency, on the one hand, and ischemic stroke subtypes, on the other, indicate that sevaral proteins (Figure 2A) and molecular pathways (Figure 2C) are shared between these pathologies (Table 3 and Table 4).
PMC6627068	D03001	However, of the CBS-associated proteins (n = 40) about half (n = 18) were affected only by CBS deficiency (Table 3, Figure 2A).
PMC6627068	D03002	These CBS deficiency-specific proteins might be associated with HHcy-related pathologies affecting other organ systems, e.g., the heart, lungs, bones, or skin, in addition to the brain [5].
PMC6627068	D03003	Bioinformatic analysis shows that CBS deficiency affects molecular pathways and networks, centering on NFκB, which affect blood clotting, immune response, and inflammation (Table 5, Figure 3A).
PMC6627068	D04000	Notably, we also found that more proteins were shared between the cardioembolic stroke subtype and CBS deficiency (13–15 shared proteins) than between the large-vessel or the lacunar subtype and CBS deficiency (seven shared proteins) (Figure 2A), suggesting that the CBS deficiency proteome better resembles the cardioembolic stroke proteome than the large-vessel or the lacunar stroke proteome.
PMC6627068	D06000	Our study also highlights subtle molecular differences between CBS deficiency and ischemic stroke subtupes.
PMC6627068	D06001	For example, some of the differentiation proteins, such as SERPINA3 and CRP involved in inflammatory/acute-phase response, as well as FGA and PLG involved in blood coagulation, were associated with the cardioembolic, large-vessel, and lacunar ischemic stroke subtypes, but not with CBS deficiency (Table 3).
PMC6627068	D07000	Some of the changes in the CBS deficiency proteome (i.e., those involving the 18 CBS deficiency-specific proteins; Figure 2A, Table 3) were most likely caused by HHcy because Hcy and anti-N-Hcy-protein autoantibody levels were elevated in CBS-deficient patients.
PMC6627068	D07001	Thus, our findings suggest two effects of CBS deficiency: HHcy-related, which affected 18 proteins, and HHcy-independent, which affected 22 other proteins.
PMC6627068	D09002	In another study, low levels of SERPINA1, PLG, KLKB1, ITIH4, and APOL1 in serum of patients with lacunar stroke were associated with poor prognosis and increased risk of recurrent stroke or myocardial infarction and cognitive decline [24].
PMC6627068	D11000	Levels of serum APOC1, which were similarly affected by CBS deficiency and ischemic stroke subtypes, and levels APOC3, which were affected only by CBS deficiency in the present study (Table 3), were also reported to be similar between ischemic stroke and controls but significantly different between hemorrhagic stroke and controls in another study [29].
PMC6627068	D12002	However, because many of the dysregulated proteins identified in the present study are involved in blood coagulation, changes in these proteins are likely to be prothrombotic and promote stroke.
PMC6627068	D13000	In conclusion, our study revealed previously unanticipated similarties between proteomic signatures of CBS deficiency and ischemic stroke subtypes, suggesting that similar mechanisms are involved in both pathologies.
PMC6627068	I01000	The individuals with cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) deficiency, a rare inborn error of metabolism, have 50% chance of vascular thromboembolism by the age of 30, which is the major cause of morbidity and mortality [5].
PMC6627068	M10000	Bioinformatic analysis to discover biological pathways containing proteins affected by CBS deficiency or ischemic stroke subtype, as well as networks containing those proteins, were carried out using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software (IPA, Ingenuity Systems, Mountain View, CA, USA).
PMC6627068	R02002	Most of the proteins affected by CBS deficiency include those involved in acute phase response (SAA1, SERPINA1, ORM2, AHSG), immune response (IGHD, IGJ, APC, C4BPA, IGHV3-72, IGK, IGKV2D-24), blood coagulation (FBLN1, KNG, APOH, C1S, C1R, CF1, CBP2, SERPINC1, SERPINF2, SERPIND1, F2, F13B), and lipid/cholesterol transport/metabolism (APOC1, APOC3, APOA1, APOM) (Table 3).
PMC6627068	R08000	Some of the stroke subtype-specific proteins (FBLN1, F2, SERPINF2, CBP2, FCN3, GPX3, IKG, and GSN) were also affected by the CBS deficiency (Table 3).
PMC6627068	R10000	Most of the 40 proteins affected by the CBS deficiency were also affected in stroke subtype comparisons: 15 for cardioembolic vs. large-vessel stroke, 13 for cardioembolic vs. lacunar stroke, and seven for large-vessel vs. lacunar stroke.
PMC6627068	R10001	Of the 40 proteins, 18 were CBS deficiency-specific, not affected by the stroke subtype (Figure 2A).
PMC6627068	R12000	To identify biological pathways linked to proteins affected by CBS deficiency or stroke subtype, we carried out bioinformatic analyses using IPA resources.
PMC6627068	R12001	We found that proteins affected by CBS deficiency were significantly enriched in 13 molecular pathways, while proteins affected by stroke subtypes were similarly enriched in the same molecular pathways (Figure 2C).
PMC6627068	R12003	20–31) pathway categories affected by both CBS deficiency and stroke subtypes were LXR/RXR activation, acute phase response signaling, FXR/RXR activation, and coagulation system (Figure 2C).
PMC6627068	R13000	IPA identified similar sets of biological networks for CBS deficiency and ischemic stroke subtypes.
PMC6627068	R13001	The two top-scoring networks (score = 35–60) associated with CBS deficiency were “humoral immune response, inflammatory response, developmental disorder” (Figure 3A) and “metabolic disease, hematological system development and function, lipid metabolism” (Table 5).
PMC6627068	R13002	A predominant network, with a score of 60, associated with CBS deficiency, contained 34 proteins: 24 were quantified by label-free mass spectrometry and 10 identified by IPA to interact with the quantified proteins (Figure 2A).
PMC6627068	R16000	CBS deficiency is characterized by the accumulation of homocysteine (Hcy)

PMC6647192	I03000	The metabolism pathway of vinorelbine primarily involves liver CYP3A4 enzymes to form inactive metabolites, except for, 4′-O-deacetylvinorelbine, the only active metabolite likely formed by carboxyl-esterases [17].
PMC6683014	M04002	Other examination items that were evaluated included: age, duration of disease, body mass index, clinical disease type (inflammatory, stricturing, penetrating), disease location range (small intestine, small and large intestine, large intestine), presence of anal lesions, surgical history (small bowel resection, ileocecal resection), disease activity (Crohn’s disease activity index: CDAI), blood test results (albumin, total cholesterol, triglyceride, cholinesterase, calcium, C-reactive protein, intact parathyroid hormone, uc-OC, PIVKA-II, folic acid, vitamin B12, and homocysteine), and therapeutic regimen (antibiotics: cefepime/metronidazole/clarithromycin, probiotics, immunosuppressants, biologics).
PMC6683645	M03000	Sequencing libraries were prepared by amplifying the V3–V4 region of the 16 S rRNA gene using the 341f-805 r primers, as described earlier.10 After the initial amplification, PCR (Polymerase chain reaction) products were confirmed with gel electrophoresis and purified using Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckham Coulter Inc., Bromma, Sweden).

PMC6692492	I01002	However paradoxically, studies also suggest that activated TLRs regulate beneficial commensal-host interactions, such as promoting commensal colonization (Round et al., 2011), balancing inflammatory response, limiting bacteria penetration (Vaishnava et al., 2008), inducing tolerance in the host immune system, and establishing epithelial barrier function (Hooper and Macpherson, 2010; Kubinak and Round, 2012).
PMC6692492	R02001	Notably, MAP2K4 from the MAPK pathway was down-regulated (>2-fold) specifically by the commensal biofilm, and the immune stimulatory molecule IL12A was down-regulated >10-fold by the cariogenic biofilm (compared to 2-fold down-regulation by commensal biofilm and no regulation by gingivitis biofilm).
PMC6701140	I03000	Several studies suggested that besides improving the cognitive performance and ability of daily living in individuals with AD, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), like donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine, also improved the mental behavioral symptoms and sleep quality of these patients [19–21].
PMC6701140	M42001	After polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, DNA fragments will be sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument and an Illumina HiSeq X instrument for 16S ribosomal DNA (16S rDNA) and metagenomics analyses (which will be chosen from some representative samples in the results of the 16S rDNA analysis), respectively, at Biomarker Technologies Co, Ltd.

PMC6791832	M12000	Human BuChE activity was determined in serum according to the Ellman et al.12 method with slight modifications13.
PMC6791832	M13000	To determine the inhibitory effect on human RBC AChE activity, the hemolyzed samples were preincubated with Tem and its metabolites for 15 min at 37 °C.
PMC6791832	M13001	The RBC AChE activity was evaluated as previously described by Bernal-Hernández et al.13 in three independent experiments conducted in duplicate.
PMC6791832	R00001	It has been assumed that the inhibition of AChE in Tem-treated rats has been mainly attributed to the formation of Tem-active metabolites as a consequence of its biotransformation14, since the presence of oxons has not, to our knowledge, been demonstrated, and there is no available toxicological information on other Tem-oxidized metabolites such as Tem-dox-SO, Tem-dox-SO2, and Tem-SO in terms of inhibiting AChE.
PMC6791832	R10000	Tem-SO is the main oxidized product in the environment, and is the only one metabolite detected in biological samples exhibited a very low ability to inhibit human RBC AChE.
PMC6803684	M04000	In all EG patients the concentrations of valproic acid in serum were in the therapeutic range, the patients had normal liver and renal functions and the serum transaminases levels were normal.
PMC6815137	D07003	This finding is consistent with previous studies implicating high CTSB and CTSL protein abundance in aggressive ovarian cancers; however, no previous studies have probed protease activity or tumor compartment-specific activity (37–39).
PMC6815137	D07004	The relatively high activity in the primary tumor site is in agreement with the roles of microenvironment remodeling factors and proteases during the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in primary metastatic tumors (40), and also could be related to microenvironmental conditions in the primary tumor that may promote the activity of these enzymes.
PMC6815137	D07005	Importantly, protein and mRNA abundance measurements alone could not detect this context-specific change in activity.
PMC6815137	I01000	Family-wide chemical proteomic probes are particularly useful because they can report on the activity of large swaths of the active proteome simultaneously, with published examples available for serine hydrolases (6, 7), kinases (8, 9), metalloproteases (10), cysteine proteases (11), and other functionalities that regulate protein activity (12–14).
PMC6815137	R01000	To pilot sADPL, we targeted proteins associated with cancer phenotypes in 2 well-characterized enzyme families, serine hydrolase and cathepsin cysteine protease enzymes, using widely available fluorophosphonate-biotin (FP-Bio) (15) and an acyloxymethylketone-based cathepsin probe (19), respectively.
PMC6815137	R01002	Using monoacylglycerol lipase (MGLL) as a model enzyme, we optimized the absolute and relative concentrations of Ab-oligo and SA-oligo conjugates required for the sADPL signal and dynamic range in whole-cell proteome (SI Appendix, Fig. S2).
PMC6815137	R01003	We then tested the sensitivity and dynamic range of sADPL quantification for diverse protein targets, including the serine hydrolase enzymes neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase 1 (NCEH1), MGLL, fatty acid
PMC6815137	R01004	amide hydrolase 1 (FAAH), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4), as well as the cysteine protease enzymes cathepsin B (CTSB) and cathepsin L (CTSL).
PMC6815137	R01005	sADPL profiling and qPCR signal quantification of all 6 enzyme targets were successful, with ΔCT values of approximately 5 to 10 cycles between background and probe treatment, a linear dynamic range 3 to 4 orders of magnitude over proteome concentration, and high reproducibility among technical and biological replicates (Fig. 2 A and B).
PMC6815137	R04000	To further verify the differences observed for DPP4 and CTSL, we measured their protein levels by Western blot analysis.
PMC6815137	R04001	The DPP4 level was 3.7-fold higher in SKOV3IP1 cells, which closely matched the activity difference measured by sADPL (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
PMC6815137	R04002	The CTSL level was 4.1-fold higher in SKOV3IP1 relative to OVCAR3; however, this measurement recognizes both precursors and mature CTSL, again supporting a significant difference between activity and abundance (SI Appendix, Fig. S3).
PMC6815137	R11009	While conclusions about the prognostic potential of these enzyme activity ratios are premature given the small patient sample, these data demonstrate that hundreds to thousands of ultrasensitive parallel activity measurements can be made directly with fresh or flash-frozen patient samples in a matter of hours on a benchtop, which stands in stark contrast to activity-based readouts by existing methods.
PMC6821880	M04012	Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) algorithm was performed with the Galaxy software package of the Huttenhower lab to identify differential abundances of microbes in the UVB treated samples (Segata et al., 2011).
PMC6827100	M02000	The V3 and V4 variables of the 16S rRNA region were amplified and the sequence library was generated by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the following primer pair:
PMC6827100	M05000	The amplification, sequencing, and library preparation workflow were conducted using Herculase II fusion DNA polymerase Nextera XT Index Kit V2, following the 16S metagenomic sequencing library preparation Part # 15044223 Rev. B protocol in Illumina® MiSeq® platform at Macrogen (Seoul, South Korea) yielding paired-end reads.
PMC6835733	D02000	Inhibition of SDH by itaconic acid may be a sepsis-specific mode of succinate accumulation.
PMC6835733	D03000	The increase in the concentration of succinic, α-ketoglutaric, and fumaric acids in the blood suggests that the inhibition of dehydrogenases occurs in the part of the TCA cycle that involves the successive oxidation of α-ketoglutaric into succinic acid and then succinic into fumaric acid.
PMC6835733	M11000	The activity of SDH also was determined by the reduction of the electron acceptor DCPIP [56].
PMC6835733	R17000	While PhCAs and itaconic acid had an inhibitory effect on SDH, significant differences in the sites of their actions were found using the intermediate electron carrier PMS.
PMC6860998	M04000	Methods for DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, and sequencing were previously described in detail.[12, 14, 15, 17] Briefly, DNA extraction, PCR amplification of the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, and amplicon preparation were performed as described by Caporaso et al.[17], using the universal bacterial primer set 515F/806R,[17, 18] and can be found on the Earth Microbiome Project website (http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/emp-standard-protocols/dna-extraction-protocol/).
PMC6861740	M04001	All polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactions were carried out with Phusion® High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), and mixture PCR products were purified with Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).
PMC6872721	D04001	We were worried that adding a nuclease for reduction of host DNA would destroy free microbial DNA as well and skew the picture of microbial communities compared to extraction kits without this step.
PMC6875299	M05000	The concentrations of H2O2, NO2−, and NO3− after plasma jet treatment in the medium without cells were measured using the hydrogen peroxide/peroxidase assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and nitrite/nitrate colorimetric assay kit (Cayman), respectively.
PMC6909750	M03001	Samples were incubated in an enzymatic cocktail containing lysozyme (0.2 mg/mL) and proteinase K (0.4 mg/mL) followed by bead beating using a Biospec Products Mini-BeadBeater-8™ (BioSpec Products, Inc.).
PMC6912393	M04000	Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed using the V3 forward primer 5′CCTACGGGGNGGCWGCAG-3′ and V4 reverse primer 5′GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′, producing a 300-bp amplicon spanning the highly variable V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene.
PMC6918408	D03000	The hypotaurine–taurine metabolism pathway starts with cystamine production via cystine decarboxylation, which is then reduced to cysteamine followed by oxidation to hypotaurine (by the enzyme cysteamine dioxygenase).
PMC6918408	D03001	Hypotaurine is finally oxidized to the final product taurine by hypotaurine dehydrogenase, which is then excreted out of the body or used within.
PMC6993102	D01000	Dihydrobiopterin (BH2) [m/z 278.0650] is a product of the oxidation of Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an important cofactor for NO synthase (NOS).
PMC6993102	D01001	Whenever there is a balance between cofactors and substrates in relation to Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), NOS catalyzes the reduction of O2 and incorporates it into the guanidine group of L-arginine, generating NO.
PMC6993102	D01002	Nonetheless, in specific situations, such as the oxidation of BH4 into BH2, a molecule that cannot work as a cofactor for NOS, a phenomenon called “uncoupling” occurs.
PMC6993102	D01003	Uncoupled NOS generates superoxide instead of nitric oxide, leading to an oxidative stress state.
PMC6993102	D02001	In an inflammatory environment, the enzyme Phospholipase A2 catalyzes the esterified AA present in the phospholipid membrane into free AA, which may be then oxidized in four different pathways: lipoxygenase (LOX), cyclooxygenase (COX), epoxygenase (CYTP450) and isoprostane.
PMC6993102	D02002	Prostaglandins are produced through the COX pathway, and leukotrienes through the LOX pathway.
PMC6993102	D02003	Two markers found in the plasma of the case group are AA metabolites: Prostaglandin B2 [m/z 299.2017] and Carboxy-Leukotriene B4 [m/z 389.1935], indicating that at least two AA oxidation pathways are putatively more active in the case group.
PMC7005843	M05000	For determination of iron oxidation potential, we included the candidate iron oxidase from acidophilic and neutrophilic iron-oxidizing bacteria, Cyc2 (Barco et al., 2015).
PMC7005843	M12000	Heme oxygenase and transport genes define another strategy that microorganisms, especially pathogens, use to obtain iron from their environment.
PMC7005843	M12001	In particular, heme oxygenases enable pathogens to obtain iron from a host through oxidative cleavage of heme, thereby releasing iron (Wilks and Heinzl, 2014).
PMC7005843	M12002	Heme oxygenases are categorized into two groups: (1) “canonical” heme oxygenases (HmuO, PigA, and HemO), which degrade heme to biliverdin and carbon monoxide, and (2) “non-canonical” heme oxygenases (IsdG, IsdI, MhuD, and Isd-LmHde), which degrade heme to products like staphylobilin (IsdG and IsdI) and mycobilin (MhuD) (Wilks and Heinzl, 2014).
PMC7005843	M12003	All these heme oxygenase genes are included in FeGenie’s HMM library.
PMC7005843	M14000	Extracytoplasmic-function (ECF) sigma factors are sensitive to signals from outside of the cell, and they bind and recruit RNA-polymerase to specific regions of the genome (Brooks and Buchanan, 2008).
PMC7005843	R05000	FeGenie was also used to identify iron acquisition and transport genes in model microorganisms, including siderophore transport and synthesis genes, heme transport and oxygenases, and Fe(II)/Fe(III) transport.
PMC7058979	D01002	We used this protocol (including a proteinase K pretreatment) to get an estimate of cells able to resist harsh conditions that fecal transplants may face during a freezing period and then, once released in the host intestine by FMT; these include the presence of host antimicrobial proteins and peptides, bacteriocins and antibacterial metabolites of bacterial origin (Ostaff et al., 2013; Kanjan and Hongpattarakere, 2016; Dicks et al., 2018).
PMC7058979	D02001	In the MOLZ procedure, according to the manufacturer guidelines, the proteinase K treatment is adapted to solubilize solid human tissues and release bacterial biofilm, whereas the CM buffer, containing a chaotropic agent, selectively disrupts human cells.
PMC7058979	D02004	Similarly, the CM buffer (the composition of which is not fully disclosed for proprietary reasons) contains substantial proportion of a chaotropic agent (guanidine hydrochloride) that has greater efficacy in lysing Gram-negative bacteria and mammalian cells than Gram-positive bacteria (Boom et al., 1990).
PMC7060658	D01000	The intestinal bacteria uncouple the bound bile acid into free bile acid through BSH and then convert the free bile acids into secondary bile acids through 7α-dehydroxylation [29].
PMC7060658	D06002	We analysed the abundances of BSH-active bacteria and found that the abundances of BSH-active bacteria at different levels were not significantly different between the control group and the gallstone group, indicating that BSH activity was not related to the abundances of BSH-active bacteria [47].
PMC7060658	M01000	After the extraction of total DNA of the samples, primers were designed according to the conserved region, and sequencing adaptors were attached to the ends of the primers for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification.
PMC7060658	R06000	Using the literature and databases, the gut microbiota with bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity were screened at different levels.
PMC7060658	R06001	The results showed that at the phylum, class, order, family and genus levels, the abundance of bacteria with BSH activity was reduced in the gallstone group compared with the control group, but this difference was not statistically significant (Fig. 6a).
PMC7060658	R06002	At these different levels, the abundance of bacteria with BSH activity in the gallstone group was also not correlated with free bile acids (Fig. ​(Fig.6b).6b).
PMC7066733	R02002	According to the KEGG function classification analysis, focal adhesion, cell adhesion molecules, the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase-protein kinase B (PI3K-Akt) signalling pathway, extracellular matrix (ECM)-receptor interactions, platelet activation, complement and coagulation cascades, cholesterol metabolism, and regulation of the actin cytoskeleton were among the top 20 enriched pathways (Fig. 3).
PMC7072610	M01002	Staining with primary monoclonal antibodies against ER and PgR (6 F11 MAb and 1E2 from Ventana Medical Systems, Inc., Tucson, AZ MAb respectively from DAKO) was done overnight at room temperature followed by a 30 min incubation with biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse antibody (Dako).
PMC7072610	M01003	Osmium tetroxide 0.2% incubation for 30 s and methyl green counter stain were used as a signal enhancer.
PMC7078914	I05002	Hypoglycemia was documented in two patients (subject 1 and subject 6) and non‐specific elevation of acylcarnitines and dicarboxylic acids in four patients (subject 1, 4, 5, and 6) suggestive of generalized energy deficiency.
PMC7078914	I05003	Ketonuria and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) elevation was present in 8/9 cases.
PMC7101307	M05001	PCR setup and cycling conditions for the primary amplification were as follows: 3 µl of template DNA, 15.05 µl of nuclease and DNA free water (VWR International, Darmstadt, Germany), 5 µl of 5 × KAPA High Fidelity Buffer (KAPA Biosystems, Wilmington, USA), 0.6 µl of 10 mM KAPA dNTP Mix, 0.25 µl of 20 mg/ml BSA (Life Technologies GmbH), 0.5 µl of KAPA High Fidelity Hot Start Polymerase, 0.3 µl of forward (10 µM) and 0.3 µl of reverse primer (10 µM).
PMC7101307	M09001	25.6 µl of nuclease and DNA free water, 10 µl of 5 × KAPA High Fidelity Buffer (KAPA Biosystems), 1.2 µl of dNTP Mix (10 mM) and 0.2 µl of KAPA High Fidelity Hot Start DNA Polymerase were added.
PMC7101307	M09002	Cycling started at 98 °C initial denaturation for 3 min, followed by 8 cycles of 98 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.
PMC7105058	I01000	In the present study, in addition to the bacterial culture, we performed a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect viruses and a clone library analysis of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequence using sputum samples to clarify the microbiological characteristics of LRTIs in NMD patients.
PMC7331577	M01000	Baseline clinical information such as age, gender, etiology (HBV, HCV), and aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), AST/ALT and the Fibrosis 4 score (FIB-4)6 were retrieved from chart records.
PMC7331577	R00000	Patient characteristics of this cohort was summarized in Table ​Table1,1, including age, gender, etiology (hepatitis B virus [HBV] or hepatitis C virus [HCV] infection), aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), AST/ALT ratio, platelet counts and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index6.
PMC7331577	R01001	Among the baseline clinical factors, age, HCV and AST were found to be associated with HCC occurrence in the univariate Cox-regression analysis (Table ​(Table2).2).
PMC7344724	A00005	Proteomic analysis revealed an increased abundance of proteins associated with an oxidative stress response, such as the glutathione s-transferase family protein (+8.43-fold), heat shock protein Hsp30/Hsp42 (+2.02-fold) and 5-demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase, mitochondrial (+1.73-fold), as well as secondary metabolites such as isocyanide synthase A icsA (+8.52-fold) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetase fmpE (+3.06-fold).
PMC7344724	D00000	Statins are widely used for the control of cholesterol and function by inhibiting the action of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase [26,27].
PMC7344724	D02000	Proteomic analysis revealed an increased abundance of a range of proteins involved in dealing with oxidative stress, including pyoverdine/dityrosine biosynthesis (+8.52-fold), 5-demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase, mitochondrial (+1.74-fold) and alcohol dehydrogenase (+1.61-fold).
PMC7344724	D02004	Deletion of fmpE in A. fumigatus resulted in reduced growth and sporulation of the mutant strains but virulence was not altered as compared to the WT strain in a murine infection model [35].
PMC7344724	I03000	Statins are widely used for the control of cholesterol and act by inhibiting the action of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-Co A) reductase and thus block cholesterol biosynthesis [13,14].
PMC7344724	R05000	The main enzyme classes that were altered in abundance in A. fumigatus treated with atorvastatin were oxidoreductases, transferases and hydrolases (Figure S4).
PMC7344724	R05001	Oxidoreductase enzymes that increased in abundance in atorvastatin treatment of A fumigatus were pyoverdine/dityrosine biosynthesis family protein (+8.52-fold), 5-demethoxyubiquinone hydroxylase, mitochondrial (+1.73-fold), alcohol dehydrogenase, putative (+1.6-fold) and Psi-producing oxygenase A (+1.55-fold).
PMC7344724	R05002	Thirteen oxidoreductase enzymes showed a decrease in abundance and included aflatoxin B1-aldehyde reductase GliO-like, putative (−2.86-fold), aryl-alcohol dehydrogenase, putative (−1.52-fold) and NADH-dependent flavin oxidoreductase, putative (−1.50-fold).
PMC7344724	R05003	Enzymes with transferase activity increased in abundance included glutathione S-transferase family protein (+8.43-fold), phosphatidylinositol transporter, putative (+2.00-fold) and allergen Asp f 4 (+1.42-fold), while O-methyltransferase (−3.68-fold), malate synthase (−2.40-fold) and GNAT family acetyltransferase, putative (−2.25-fold) were decreased in abundance.
PMC7344724	R05004	Nine hydrolytic enzymes were increased in abundance and these included kynureninase (4.48-fold), amidase putative (+2.77-fold), lipase/esterase putative (+2.12-fold) and methionine aminopeptidase 2-2 (+1.83-fold).
PMC7344724	R05005	In contrast two hydrolytic enzymes were reduced in abundance (haloalkanoic acid dehalogenase, putative (−2.99-fold) and phytase, putative (−1.42-fold).
PMC7346861	A02001	The amyloid beta A4 protein, apolipoprotein A-IV, gelsolin, contactin-1, gamma-glutamyl hydrolase, and complement factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR1) were selected for further analysis.
PMC7346861	D04000	CFHR1 blocks C5 convertase activity and interferes with C5b surface association to regulate the complement system (Hannan et al., 2016).
PMC7346861	M04000	A human complement factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR1) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (Catalog No: IC-CFHR1-Hu), human contactin 1 (CNTN1) ELISA kit (Catalog No: IC-CNTN1-Hu), human gelsolin ELISA kit (Catalog No: IC-GS-Hu), human amyloid precursor protein ELISA kit (Catalog No: DL-APP-Hu), and human gamma-glutamyl hydrolase ELISA kit (Catalog No: CSB-EL009389HU) were used to validate whether these proteins were differentially expressed in large numbers of samples.
PMC7346861	R02002	Gelsolin and contactin-1 have been reported to be expressed during TC (Kim et al., 2007; Shi et al., 2015), but their role as potential serum protein markers has not yet been studied.
PMC7377154	M02001	An aliquot of 1.0 mL urine was added to a 2.0 mL glass vial containing 1.0 mL of 0.5 M NaOAc buffer (pH 5), β-glucuronidase (1000 units) and arylsulfatase (8000 units), and 5 pmol of [13C6]Phe-1,2-D as internal standard.
PMC7499026	D03000	Using the BIA-MS approach, mucin-binding cytoplasmic proteins (PK, GroEL, EF-Tu, PGK, Tal, and Hsp20) were isolated from B. longum NCC2705 EV fractions.
PMC7499026	M09001	Genes (bl0959, groEL, tuf, pgk, tal, and bl0576) were amplified by PCR with Ex Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa BIO) using B. longum NCC2705 genomic DNA as a template (primer pairs are listed in Table S2).
PMC7499026	M14000	For the quantification of microbead fecal shedding, 100 μl of recombinant GroEL- or Tal-immobilized beads or control beads (approximately 108 particles) was administered per mouse by gavage.
PMC7506152	D03001	Sphingosine (Sph) can be generated under the action of ceramase and further be phosphorylated into S1P by Sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) (Figure 1).
PMC7506152	D03002	Cumulative evidences have demonstrated that S1P can promote tumor proliferation, migration, transformation, and participate in the growth and invasion of cancer cells (36–38).
PMC7506152	M03000	Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured using an Olympus Automatic Biochemical Analyzer AU5400 (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).
PMC7506152	M04000	Various non-invasive markers, such as model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), fibrosis 4 index (FIB-4), and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) (24, 28), were assessed in this study, which were calculated according to clinical and laboratory parameters at the time of inclusion.
PMC7542363	A00001	However, pathogenic, and commensal bacteria have evolved specific glycoproteases that overcome the steric impediment posed by carbohydrates, cleaving glycoproteins precisely at their glycosylation site(s).
PMC7542363	D00002	However, there is growing evidence that bacterial pathogens and commensals have evolved specific proteases that overcome the steric impediment posed by carbohydrates and indeed use glycans as recognition determinants to cleave glycoproteins right at the glycosylation site.
PMC7542363	D00006	Our MS analysis of proteolytic fragments resulting from glycoprotein treatment with CpaA revealed that CpaA has a consensus target sequence consisting of a Pro residue followed by a glycosylated Ser or Thr (P-S/T), which is unprecedented for bacterial glycoproteases.
PMC7542363	I03000	Few glycoprotein-targeting zinc metallo-endopeptidases have been structurally characterized.
PMC7542363	I03001	They belong to either the metzincin or gluzincin protease superfamilies (16, 17).
PMC7542363	I03002	Metzincin proteases have a characteristic extended zinc-binding motif (HEXXHXXGXXH) and a conserved Met turn, whereas gluzincin proteases have a glutamate residue in the zinc-binding motif (HEXXHE) (18).
PMC7542363	I03006	Interestingly, these repeats share fold similarities to a domain present in the metzincin protease StcE, a secreted glycoprotease from enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), though their detailed sequence and structural similarities are very limited (13, 20).
PMC7542363	R01000	The activity of glycoproteases is differentially impacted by many factors, such as O-glycosylation density and glycan composition.
PMC7542363	R01001	For instance, StcE and TagA, a secreted glycoprotease from Vibrio cholerae, uniquely cleave heavily glycosylated proteins, such as mucins, but they cannot digest less O-glycosylated proteins, such as fetuin (Ft).
PMC7542363	R02001	(A) CpaA does not cleave either exclusively N-glycosylated protein RNaseB or unglycosylated proteins such as RNaseA and BSA.
PMC7542363	R02002	RNase A contains traces of RNase B. RNase B, RNase A, and BSA were incubated with and without purified CpaA. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE.
PMC7542363	R03000	The activity of various glycoproteases can be dependent on, inhibited by, or unaffected by the presence of sialic acid, a negatively charged 9-C sugar with key biological functions (34).
PMC7542363	R03001	For example, glycoproteases from Mannheimia haemolytica and Clostridium perfringens require sialic acid for activity, whereas other glycoproteases are inhibited by this sugar (16, 35, 36).
PMC7542363	R03002	StcE is an example of a glycoprotease that is indifferent to sialic acid (22).
PMC7542363	R04003	Together, these results indicate that CpaA possesses broad substrate specificity, being able to cleave multiple O-glycosylated proteins in addition to fV and fXII, and that CpaA activity is unaffected by sialylation.
PMC7542363	R21000	Mounting evidence indicates that both commensal and pathogenic species produce and secrete glycoproteases to modulate adherence, penetrate the inner mucus layer, or evade the host immune response (18, 21, 47).
PMC7542363	R22000	Due to low amino acid sequence conservation, it is not possible to differentiate proteases from glycoproteases solely on the basis of primary amino acid sequence.
PMC7542363	R22004	Thus, even if structural analyses identify putative glycan-binding domains in a protein of interest, it is difficult to predict the specific substrates targeted by the putative glycoprotease.
PMC7677002	D05006	Furthermore, Venn and network analyses showed no interactions between the DEG and downregulated genes (Fig. 11C and ​andD),D), and they suggest that citral does not affect the normal growth and metabolism of A. baumannii.
PMC7677002	D07003	The response regulator receiver domain protein (AdeRS) is a two-component system of A. baumannii that regulates the expression of the efflux pump (RND family), TetR family transcriptional regulators, and LysR family transcriptional regulators.
PMC7677002	M22000	For catalase activity, after electrophoresis, the gel (8%) was washed three times with 50 mM KPi buffer.

PMC7928900	D02000	Alteration in the expression of ACE2 receptor transcriptional activity has been reported with chronic heart failure, hypertension and lung injury (Tikellis and Thomas 2012).

PMC7928900	D02002	Thus, ACE2 is implicated to play a protective and beneficial role against lung diseases.
PMC7928900	D02004	Besides, Ang II playing a causative role in the initiation of inflammatory response involving bradykinin, nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) signal transduction pathways (Cheng, Vapaatalo and Mervaala 2005), Ang II also modulates the cellular oxidative stress, mediated by AT1 receptors which increases the reactive oxygen species (ROS).

PMC8021180	D04001	One of the most represented groups of proteins we found in the egg proteome were those related to energy and metabolism and included proteins associated with glycolysis (enolase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GADPH), gluconeogenesis (triosephosphate isomerase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase GTP) and other metabolic enzymes such as alpha-1,4 glucan phosphorylase and malic enzyme (S1 Table).

PMC8036917	D01000	Ruxolitinib is a widely used drug in PV and myelofibrosis patients where it must be imported in the intracellular compartment in order to block JAK2 phosphorylation.
PMC8036917	D01002	ABC proteins act as nutrient importers [30,31,32] but have been linked with resistance to numerous drugs including ABCG2-mediated export of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), such as imatinib and nilotinib [7].
PMC8036917	M04001	Samples were lysed for 45 min at 4 °C in a lysis buffer containing 20 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.002% NaN3, 1% Triton X-100, 0.2% BSA, and phosphatase (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and protease inhibitor cocktails (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland).

PMC8036917	R03003	The K562 ABCG2 cells displayed a significantly lower IC50 value of ruxolitinib compared to the mock-transfected cells (Figure 4B,C), indicating that increased ABCG2 levels enhance ruxolitinib-induced apoptosis.
PMC8045895	A00000	Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) enzyme has antioxidative properties and is present in mammalian blood and several other body fluids.
PMC8045895	A00001	In blood, PON1 is usually integrated into the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.
PMC8045895	A00002	PON1 is a highly versatile enzyme displaying diverse functions such as arylesterase, lactonase, and paraoxonase, among others.
PMC8045895	A00003	PON1 activities are usually investigated with artificial substrates, for example, dihydrocoumarin and thiobutyl butyrolactone for lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	A00004	The PON1 enzyme activities measured with different substrates tend to be falsely assumed as being equivalent in the literature, although there are poor or weak correlations among the PON1 enzyme activities with different substrates.
PMC8045895	A00005	In addition, and despite our knowledge of the factors influencing PON1 paraoxonase and arylesterase activities, there is little knowledge of PON1 lactonase activity variations and attendant mechanisms.
PMC8045895	A00006	This is important considering further that the lactonase activity is the native activity of PON1.
PMC8045895	A00007	We report here a multi-omics analysis of PON1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	A00008	The influence of genetic variations, particularly of single nucleotide polymorphisms and epigenetic, proteomic, and lipidomic variations on PON1 lactonase activity are reviewed.
PMC8045895	A00009	In addition, the influence of various environmental, clinical, and demographic variables on PON1 lactonase activity is discussed.
PMC8045895	A00010	Finally, we examine the associations between PON1 lactonase activity and health states and common complex diseases such as atherosclerosis, dementias, obesity, and diabetes.
PMC8045895	A00011	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-omics analysis of PON1 lactonase activity with an eye to future applications in basic life sciences and translational medicine and the nuances of critically interpreting PON1 function with lactones as substrates.
PMC8045895	C00000	Paraoxonase activity, with the eponymous substrate, and arylesterase activity, with phenlyacetate as a substrate, had been used to characterize serum PON1 since the 1980s.
PMC8045895	C00001	Lactonase activity measurements only began to be used in the mid-2000s, after a series of articles, which suggested that lactonase is the native activity of PON1 and which launched several promising artificial lactone substrates of PON1 (Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2006).
PMC8045895	C01000	Measuring PON1 lactonase activity has always been sidelined by paraoxonase and arylesterase activities.
PMC8045895	C01001	For example, Zhao et al. (2012) conducted a meta-analysis in which they gathered 43 studies investigating the association between serum PON1 activity and risk of CVD.
PMC8045895	C01002	All the studies in question included at least one substrate for paraoxonase activity and at least one for arylesterase activity; however, the authors of the meta-analysis could not find a single study in which a lactone substrate would be tested.
PMC8045895	C02000	The association between PON1 activity and disease is most often based on the determination of a single activity.
PMC8045895	C04001	Clinical researchers should also include measurements of lactonase activity in future PON1 studies, and studies carried out before 2000 would benefit from a remake with lactone substrate participation.
PMC8045895	C06000	(3) Researchers focusing on PON1 lactonase activity in humans are advised to conduct genotyping as well.
PMC8045895	C07000	(4) When investigating the association of PON1 lactonase activity, and other PON1 activities, with specific medical conditions, it is advisable to account for other comorbidities, especially the ones that have been associated with PON1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	C08000	(5) More generally, the different multi-omics factors that can influence PON1 lactonase activity should be kept in mind by researchers.
PMC8045895	C09000	This study contributes to better understanding of the associations among all three PON1 enzyme activities and different diseases/conditions while highlighting the importance of measuring lactonase activity in clinical studies.
PMC8045895	I00000	Numerous articles have been published in the last decades about serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1), an enzyme found in different mammal species and other animals, including fishes, amphibians, and birds, and its association with various medical conditions in humans.
PMC8045895	I00001	Various biological and environmental/social factors can influence PON1 expression and activity.
PMC8045895	I01000	The association between PON1 and medical conditions is usually investigated with three most common approaches: (1) genotyping of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), (2) quantification of enzyme in a biological sample, and (3) measurement of enzymatic activity of PON1 as determined using different substrates (Ceron et al., 2014).
PMC8045895	I01001	Gene polymorphisms, enzyme quantity, and enzyme activity are different parameters that may or may not correlate with each other (Costa et al., 2005); however, it is less well understood that different enzymatic activities of PON1 may or may not correlate with each other as well.
PMC8045895	I02000	The three main activities of PON1 are aryldialkylphosphatase, more commonly known as paraoxonase activity, arylesterase and lactonase activity (Harel et al., 2004).
PMC8045895	I02001	Each of these can be investigated with several different artificial substrates (Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2005); however, the exact physiological substrates of PON1 are poorly understood.
PMC8045895	I03000	Paraoxonase activity is unlikely to be a native activity of PON1, as organophosphates are uncommon in nature (Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2005; Metcalf and Bruno, 2016).
PMC8045895	I03001	Structure-reactivity studies suggest that the primary function of PON1 in terms of evolutionary development is lactonase activity (Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2005).
PMC8045895	I03002	Especially paraoxonase activity is often poorly correlated with the other two enzymatic activities (Gugliucci et al., 2015; Kowalska et al., 2018; Martinelli et al., 2013; Romani et al., 2009; Rosenblat et al., 2006).
PMC8045895	I03003	Thus, the experimental results of PON1 can be grouped by enzymatic activity and those research articles in which the same activity has been investigated, preferably with the same substrate, can be compared.
PMC8045895	I04000	An extensive review on paraoxonase and arylesterase activities has already been published (Dardiotis et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	I04001	However, the literature lacks analyses on PON1's native (lactonase) activity.
PMC8045895	I04002	Although different research groups have focused on SNP variation in the PON1 gene and its association with enzymatic activity (Dardiotis et al., 2019; Darney et al., 2020), factors besides genotype may also influence the enzymatic activity of PON1.
PMC8045895	I04003	Hence, in this study, we examine different -omics levels that have been associated specifically with the lactonase activity of PON1.
PMC8045895	I04004	This article is the first to specifically address and review the lactonase activity of PON1.
PMC8045895	I05000	In this analysis, we also examine and synthesize the associations between various medical conditions and the lactonase activity of PON1.
PMC8045895	I05001	As PON1 has antioxidative activity, its lactonase activity may be correlated with oxidative stress- and inflammation-related diseases, primarily those associated with aging.
PMC8045895	I05002	Indeed PON1 activity is shown to be associated with neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), as well as diabetes, cancer, and other disorders (Shunmoogam et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	I06000	Most of the research on PON1 lactonase activity has been performed on humans; however, some research groups also investigated lactonase activity in mice, rats, and cows (Farid et al., 2013;
PMC8045895	I06003	Because rePON1 variants, unlike native PON1, are water soluble, they are preferred instead of native PON1 for the investigation of general properties of paraoxonases and for biotechnological applications.
PMC8045895	I06004	However, these investigations are not included in this study because they are of limited relevance to this article's focus on biological influences of PON1 activity, and on PON1's influence on the phenome in turn.
PMC8045895	I07000	The two most common lactone substrates used on PON1 are dihydrocoumarin (DHC) and thiobutyl butyrolactone (TBBL), which have been cited in at least 100 research articles.
PMC8045895	I07002	Another commonly used substrate is homocystein thiolactone (HcyTL), which is usually treated separately as the main determinant of thiolactonase activity, and hence is omitted in this review.
PMC8045895	I08001	Some of the factors discussed in this article (e.g., variations in the promoter sequence of the PON1 gene) are likely to primarily affect the amount of PON1 that is present in an organism, whereas others (e.g., the presence of drugs interacting with PON1 in the bloodstream) are likely to primarily influence PON1's affinity for its substrates.
PMC8045895	I08002	Because almost all the studies cited in this article used specific activity as the only measure of PON1 lactonase activity, it is usually not possible to disentangle these two components.
PMC8045895	M01000	It has been emphasized that in any study investigating PON1 activity, cases and controls should be matched for PON1 haplotype, as the amount of PON1 activity is mainly determined by SNP distribution (Mackness and Mackness, 2015).
PMC8045895	M01001	As the overall number of articles dealing with lactonase PON1 activity is limited, this criterion could not be fulfilled in this analysis, which is structured according to the omics taxonomy proposed previously (Pirih and Kunej, 2017).
PMC8045895	R02000	The two most frequently reported polymorphisms on the human PON1 gene are SNPs that change the amino acid sequence of PON1, rs662 and rs854560, also referred to as Q192R and L55M, respectively (Shunmoogam et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R02001	There is one more SNP in the coding region of PON1, rs13306698 or R160G, with a rather low minor allele frequency of 0.02–0.11; there are no studies investigating it in connection with PON1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R02002	There are also several other SNPs present either in introns or the promoter region of PON1, of which the best known is rs705379 (also referred as -107 C/T or -108 C/T) (Shunmoogam et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R03000	Two different articles provided numbers for the percentage of variation of activity that is explained by each of the main parameters, such as genetic variations and sex, affecting PON1 lactonase activity (Quillen et al., 2012; Rainwater et al., 2009).
PMC8045895	R04002	Genetic polymorphisms Q192R and L55M account for 8.3 and 4.1% of interindividual variation in PON1 lactonase activity, respectively, whereas four other SNPs in promoter region, rs854522, rs854534, rs757158, and rs7803148, account for 1.8%, 3.8%, 9.2%, and 1.1% of variability, respectively.
PMC8045895	R05003	It was shown that low levels of Linc-OIP5 correspond to lower levels of PON1 expression and lactonase activity, whereas high levels of miR-616 gene expression had the opposite effect and decreased PON1 expression and lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R05004	This difference was demonstrated with high significance in cell culture and in the serum of patients with coronary atherosclerosis.
PMC8045895	R06000	The activities of PON1 toward lactones, phosphotriesters, and arylesters were suggested to all reside in the same active site (Khersonsky and Tawfik, 2005); however, different changes to PON1 structure might have an uneven effect on different PON1 activities.
PMC8045895	R06001	Hernandez et al. (2009) and Ferretti et al. (2010) investigated the effect of changes in PON1 structure on lactonase activity (Ferretti et al., 2010; Hernandez et al., 2009).
PMC8045895	R08000	A similar analysis was carried out investigating the effect of in vitro homocysteinylation of HDL particles, which is known to occur in vivo, on PON1 lactonase activity (Ferretti et al., 2010).
PMC8045895	R08001	The authors demonstrated a decrease in lactonase activity with increasing addition of homocystein thiolactone.
PMC8045895	R08002	The concentrations they used were from 10 to 1000 μM, and the last of them led to a two-third decrease in lactonase activity compared with the control HDL, where HcyT was absent.
PMC8045895	R09000	The lipidomic context of PON1 lactonase activity was investigated with DHC as a substrate in two articles (Rosenblat et al., 2006, 2012).
PMC8045895	R10001	They analyzed arylesterase, paraoxonase, and lactonase activities, and as expected, no activity was observed in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), whereas all three activities were observed in the HDL fraction.
PMC8045895	R11000	Of interest, paraoxonase activity was similar in HDL and LPDS, whereas arylesterase and lactonase activities were significantly higher in HDL compared with LPDS.
PMC8045895	R11001	With lactonase, the difference in activity between HDL and LPDS was greatest.
PMC8045895	R11002	Rosenblat et al. (2006) suggested that the environment in HDL stabilizes PON1's structure; displacement from HDL causes conformational changes that reduce lactonase and arylesterase activity, whereas paraoxonase activity is less sensitive to such changes.
PMC8045895	R12000	In the second article, Rosenblat et al. (2012) reported the influence of VLDL and free triglycerides on the activity of serum PON1.
PMC8045895	R12001	The authors distinguished PON1 lactonase activity in the total serum and in HDL-bound PON1.
PMC8045895	R12002	The addition of VLDL caused a decrease in HDL-bound PON1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R13000	All the macroscopic, behavioral, and personal parameters with which researchers have attempted to explain interindividual variation in PON1 lactonase activity, such as age, gender, exercise, diet/nutriomics, medications, and exposure to chemicals, were grouped together as “Environmental/Social effects.”
PMC8045895	R14000	Although the influence of age on PON1 activity in humans is still not entirely clear for adolescents and adults, it has been shown that neonatal PON1 arylesterase activity is much lower than that of toddlers (Cole et al, 2003).
PMC8045895	R14001	For lactonase activity, Gugliucci et al.
PMC8045895	R15000	In several articles, the authors grouped their results on lactonase activity into categories, including age.
PMC8045895	R15001	An example of such a study is the genome-wide association approach by Quillen et al. (2012), where the authors identified that age accounts for 1.4% of interindividual variation in PON1 lactonase activity (Quillen et al., 2012).
PMC8045895	R16000	Among other factors that influence PON1 activity, Quillen et al. (2012) also focused on the effect of gender on lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R16001	Although the authors' model indicates that 0.4% of the interindividual difference in both paraoxonase and arylesterase activities can be explained by gender, we suggest that gender does not appreciably explain interindividual variation in DHC lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R17000	A more recent article also focused on the influence of gender on PON1, with TBL as a substrate, and concludes that gender does influence lactonase activity (Trentini et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	R17001	Trentini et al. detected higher PON1 lactonase activity among women than among men, even after accounting for confounders such as concentrations of HDL and cholesterol, age, smoking, body mass index, and waist circumference.
PMC8045895	R17002	The authors reported a significant difference between genders for both lactonase and arylesterase activities (Trentini et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	R18004	The authors concluded that pomegranate juice consumption temporarily and significantly increases serum PON1 lactonase activity, both in HDL and LPDS, when both DHC and TBBL were used as substrates.
PMC8045895	R19000	Aviram and Rosenblat (2012) also investigated how the consumption of several different juices impacts PON1 lactonase activity for DHC.
PMC8045895	R19001	They found that in healthy subjects, consumption of currant juice and pomegranate juice both led to an increase in PON1 lactonase activity after 1 week.
PMC8045895	R19002	Acai, grape juice, and wine however did not significantly impact PON1 activity (Aviram and Rosenblat, 2012).
PMC8045895	R20000	Kameyama et al. (2016) studied the impact of diet on PON1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R20001	In their study, male volunteers who consumed three different meals and lactonase activity, with TBBL as a substrate, was determined after consumption of these meals.
PMC8045895	R21000	Model organisms have also been used to perform experiments about the impact of diet high in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) on PON1 lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R21001	No significant difference in lactonase activity of rat serum before and after a PUFA-rich meal has been demonstrated.
PMC8045895	R21002	Moreover, authors also found no difference in lactonase activity between the nondiabetic control without oil administration and the diabetic group (Kopál et al., 2014).
PMC8045895	R22000	Although the interactions of PON1 with various mediations have been established and are displayed in databases such as DrugBank (Wishart et al., 2017), only few of these studies investigated lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R22001	For example, of the 12 articles focusing on association of PON1 activity and medications for schizophrenia, which were analyzed in a recent review (Moreira et al., 2018), only Gilca et al. (2014) investigated lactonase activity using DHC as a substrate.
PMC8045895	R23001	compared lactonase activity in patients taking clozapine, patients taking risperidone, and with healthy individuals.
PMC8045895	R23002	The authors demonstrated that taking risperidone resulted in significantly lower lactonase activity than the healthy control group.
PMC8045895	R23003	The authors also showed that the patients taking clozapine in turn had a significantly lower lactonase activity than the patients taking risperidone.
PMC8045895	R24000	Another group of medications, which has been associated with PON1 lactonase activity in one study, are oral contraceptives (Kowalska et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R24001	The authors concluded that taking contraceptives correlated with a significant increase in lactonase and arylesterase activity, but with a significant decrease in paraoxonase activity.
PMC8045895	R25000	PON1 is among the few enzymes that offer protection against organophosphate pesticides.
PMC8045895	R25001	Lozano-Paniagua et al. (2016) conducted a study in which they addressed the effect of pesticide exposure on PON1 lactonase activity for DHC.
PMC8045895	R25002	The authors concluded that while lactonase activity is not significantly affected by the amount of exposure to pesticides, there is a significant decrease in lactonase activity in greenhouse workers in comparison with the healthy controls with no occupational exposure to pesticides.
PMC8045895	R25003	The authors tested several different organophosphate substrates and reported that higher exposure to pesticides did however lead to a significant decrease in arylesterase activity and, interestingly, to a nonsignificant increase in paraoxonase activity (Lozano-Paniagua et al., 2016).
PMC8045895	R26000	A study followed the effects of an exercise regimen in a group of obese human subjects on the DHC lactonase and paraoxonase activities of their serum PON1 (Russo et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R28000	PON1 lactonase activity has been studied regarding several diseases and other medical conditions.
PMC8045895	R29000	Of all the medical conditions studied in association with PON1 activity, one of the most frequently investigated one is CVD: coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis.
PMC8045895	R29001	Many articles have been published investigating the association of these with PON1, including six articles that included lactonase activity, four of which have been carried out on humans (Gugliucci et al., 2015; Martinelli et al., 2009; Murillo-González et al., 2020; Ponce-Ruiz et al., 2020) and two on animals (De Keyzer et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2010).
PMC8045895	R31002	The authors then normalized TBBL activity by dividing it with 7-O-diethyl phosphoryl,3-cyano,4-methyl,7-hydroxycoumarin (DEPCyMC) activity, which has been indicated as a surrogate marker for determining PON1 concentration (Gaidukov and Tawfik, 2007).
PMC8045895	R32000	The resulting normalized lactonase activity was significantly higher in the group with CAD, especially noticeable in individuals with the PON1 192QQ genotype.
PMC8045895	R32001	When they grouped the CAD patients into those with and without myocardial infarction, however, they found no significant difference for any measure of lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R32002	Other PON1 enzyme activities were not significantly different between any two categories of patients that they compared.
PMC8045895	R33000	Gugliucci et al. (2015) compared two different ethnic populations, Palestinians and Israelis, and their PON1 enzymatic activities.
PMC8045895	R33001	They found that Palestinians had significantly lower DHC lactonase and arylesterase activities, whereas paraoxonase activity was similar in both populations.
PMC8045895	R33002	From this finding, the authors concluded that the lower lactonase PON1 activity in a Palestinian population is a risk factor for CAD and diabetes.
PMC8045895	R34000	Another study investigated PON1 activity in apolipoprotein-deficient mice expressing human PON1 by adenovirus-mediated insertion of human paraoxonase 1 (hPON1) into mice cells (Zhang et al., 2010).
PMC8045895	R34001	The authors investigated the size of atherosclerotic lesions, which are a risk factor for CVD, and found that transgenic mice with overexpressed hPON1 had significantly higher DHC lactonase activity in their serum, and reduced atherosclerotic lesion size.
PMC8045895	R35000	The PON1–atherosclerosis association has also been investigated in pigs (De Keyzer et al., 2009).
PMC8045895	R36000	PON1 lactonase activity has also been investigated in association with liver illnesses.
PMC8045895	R36002	It was found that PON1 lactonase activity for DHC was significantly lower in alcoholic hepatitis compared with controls, and being significantly lower in viral hepatitis compared with alcoholic hepatitis.
PMC8045895	R37000	In another article, the authors investigated TBBL lactonase activity of PON1 in individuals with liver cirrhosis and patients with mild-to-moderate changes in liver function (Marsillach et al., 2009).
PMC8045895	R37001	The authors did not find a statistically significant correlation between enzymatic activities of PON1 and the presence and/or severity of disease.
PMC8045895	R38000	Serum lactonase activity for DHC was also investigated in dairy cows (Samir Farid et al., 2013).
PMC8045895	R38002	The authors concluded that paraoxonase, DHC lactonase, and arylesterase activity were all significantly lower in animals with fatty liver compared with the control group.
PMC8045895	R39000	Another factor that has been thoroughly studied in association with PON1 lactonase activity is body weight.
PMC8045895	R39001	Three articles reported on the association between body weight and DHC lactonase activity (Alaminos-Castillo et al., 2019; Bacchetti et al., 2019; Rupérez et al., 2013), Ferré et al. (2013) investigated TBBL and Cervellati et al.
PMC8045895	R39004	Of these five articles, three of them found a significant correlation between PON1 lactonase activity and obesity (Alaminos-Castillo et al., 2019; Bacchetti et al., 2019; Ferré et al., 2013).
PMC8045895	R40000	Alaminos-Castillo et al. (2019) reported that DHC lactonase activity is significantly decreased in obese subjects compared with nonobese controls, and increases after surgery.
PMC8045895	R40001	Bacchetti et al. (2019) grouped cases into two categories, overweight women and obese women, and detected that DHC lactonase activity is significantly decreased in each subsequent category compared with healthy individuals (Bacchetti et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	R40002	Ferré et al. (2013) showed a significant decrease in TBBL lactonase activity in obese children compared with nonobese controls.
PMC8045895	R40003	PON1 concentration was the same in both groups, based on which the authors suggested that in obese children, there is higher oxidative stress, which leads to partial inhibition of PON1 by lipid peroxides.
PMC8045895	R41000	Rupérez et al (2013) did not find an association between PON1 lactonase activity and obesity.
PMC8045895	R41001	Although the authors did not find an association between childhood obesity and any of PON1's enzymatic activities, they did find a positive correlation of DHC lactonase activity with HDL, as well as with concentration of antioxidants.
PMC8045895	R41004	demonstrated a significant decrease in arylesterase activity in very obese subjects; however, they did not show any difference in paraoxonase activity and TBBL lactonase activity between the groups.
PMC8045895	R41005	Hence, the authors concluded that the apparent obesity-associated decrease of PON1 activity might simply reflect the decrease in concentration of HDL.
PMC8045895	R42000	Five articles reported on PON1 lactonase activity in the context of diabetes (Craciun et al., 2016, Rosenblat et al., 2006, Passaro et al., 2018, Zhou et al., 2020a, 2020b).
PMC8045895	R43000	In women with gestational diabetes mellitus, no significant difference was found in either TBBL lactonase activity or PON1 concentration between women with diabetes and healthy controls (Zhou et al., 2020a).
PMC8045895	R44001	A significant decrease in δ-valerolactone lactonase activity was noted between controls and patients who had both type 1 diabetes and a high amount of hemoglobin glycation.
PMC8045895	R45000	DHC lactonase activity was also investigated in a study that compared patients with diabetes, patients with hypercholesterolemia, and healthy controls.
PMC8045895	R45001	The conclusion was that lactonase activity was significantly reduced in both groups of patients, where diabetic patients had the lowest activity.
PMC8045895	R45002	The same results were acquired for both paraoxonase activity and arylesterase activity (Rosenblat et al., 2006).
PMC8045895	R46001	compared PON1 activity for TBL in patients with type 2 diabetes and in healthy controls.
PMC8045895	R46002	The authors concluded that there is no correlation between lactonase activity and presence of diabetes, whereas diabetic patients on average had significantly lower arylesterase activity than healthy controls (Passaro et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R47001	compared PON1 lactonase activity for TBBL in neonates with diabetic mothers and in neonates with mothers without diabetes (Zhou et al., 2020b).
PMC8045895	R47002	They found a significant increase in both lactonase activity and DEPCyMC-normalized lactonase activity in children of diabetic patients compared with healthy controls.
PMC8045895	R48000	PON1 lactonase activity for DHC was also compared for Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and healthy controls.
PMC8045895	R48001	The researchers measured lactonase activity and calculated the quotients lactonase activity/HDL concentration and lactonase activity/LDL concentration.
PMC8045895	R49000	Several other medical conditions were studied in association with PON1 lactonase activity: among them are intestinal cancer, psoriasis, celiac disease, hereditary hemochromatosis, chronic kidney disease (CKD), renal disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPB), bronchial asthma, and acute pancreatitis.
PMC8045895	R50000	Bains et al. (2019) compared PON1 lactonase activity in patients with intestinal cancer before and after treatment.
PMC8045895	R50001	The authors concluded that both arylesterase and DHC lactonase activity significantly decreased after the surgery (compared with before treatment), and then increased again with time (Bains et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	R51000	In psoriatic children, DHC lactonase activity of PON1, as well as arylesterase and paraoxonase activities were found to all be significantly reduced compared with healthy controls (Bacchetti et al., 2020).
PMC8045895	R51001	The authors also measured the concentration of myeloperoxidase (MPO), another enzyme in HDL, which can interact with PON1 and influence its activity.
PMC8045895	R51002	MPO concentration and activity were both significantly decreased and negatively correlated with a decrease in all PON1 enzymatic activities in psoriatic patients.
PMC8045895	R52000	A significant decrease in PON1 DHC lactonase activity was shown in celiac disease (Ferretti et al., 2012).
PMC8045895	R52001	Lactonase activity was lower in diet-treated patients compared with healthy controls, and even lower in patients at diagnosis, when they had not yet begun their diet.
PMC8045895	R52002	Similar results were obtained for PON1 arylesterase and paraoxonase activities.
PMC8045895	R53000	In hereditary hemochromatosis, PON1 paraoxonase activity was significantly decreased in patients with the condition compared with healthy controls, but DHC lactonase and arylesterase activities were not decreased significantly (Martinelli et al., 2013).
PMC8045895	R53001	The authors also subdivided patients into those undergoing treatment through phlebotomy and those not undergoing it, and found that none of the PON1 activities correlated with presence of treatment, except for DEPCyMCase activity.
PMC8045895	R54000	In CKD, a significant decrease in PON1 benzopiran-2-one lactonase activity was reported in cases compared with healthy controls (Mohammed et al., 2019).
PMC8045895	R54001	After adjusting for concentration, the authors showed that lactonase activity was significantly higher in patients compared with non-CKD controls.
PMC8045895	R54002	The authors also compared the groups of CKD patients with high and low lactonase activity in terms of survival rate and reported that patients with higher lactonase activity also had a higher survival rate.
PMC8045895	R54003	No such difference in survival rate was shown when comparing the group with a high PON1 enzyme concentration against the group with a low PON1 concentration.
PMC8045895	R55000	For end-stage renal patients, a study compared DHC lactonase before and after dialysis and found that activity increases significantly after dialysis, as do arylesterase and paraoxonase activities (Gugliucci et al., 2011).
PMC8045895	R57000	In the case of bronchial asthma, both arylesterase and DHC lactonase PON1 activities were shown to be lower in asthmatics compared with healthy controls (Chen et al., 2018).
PMC8045895	R57001	The authors verified this by addition of PON1 to the serum sample, which resulted in a very significant rise in lactonase activity.
PMC8045895	R59000	Different approaches for measuring PON1 lactonase activity do not produce the same results.
PMC8045895	R60000	PON1 activity that was reported in the studies cited by the present review was always presented as specific enzyme activity.
PMC8045895	R65001	Billecke et al. (2000) compared the specific activities of human PON1 isoforms Q and R for DHC and found a difference of <20% between these two isoforms, whereas the difference between the highest and the lowest observed specific activity in Table 2 of this article is more than an order of magnitude.
PMC8050915	D02000	Liver enzymes, especially ALT and AST, are the first laboratory tests every clinician will consider worth evaluating in a patient with liver diseases.
PMC8050915	D02001	In most cases, the higher the ALT and AST levels, the more severe the liver damage [32].
PMC8050915	D02002	However, all patients included in this study were early NAFLD patients showed normal liver chemistry, thus there were no statistically significant differences in serum concentrations of ALT, AST, ALP, γ-GT, TB, DB, TP, ALB and CHE between the two groups (Additional file 1: Fig. S1).
PMC8050915	M07001	Measurements of blood glucose, ALT, AST, TB, DB, TP, ALB, Che, ALP, γ—GT, TG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C and other serum indicators were performed on an automated chemistry analyzer (Hitachi 7600d-210, Japan).
PMC8050915	R01000	From Table ​Table1,1, we found that there was no remarkable difference in biochemical indexes (including TBA, CHE, TB, DB, TP, ALB, γ-GT, ALP, AST, ALT and GLU) between the NAFLD group and the control group (p > 0.05).
PMC8125016	C00000	The use of ATRA and HDAC inhibitors is considered for the treatment of non-promyelocytic variants of AML.
PMC8125016	D04010	Finally, immune-mediated mechanisms may also be important for chemosensitivity because ATRA/VP reduces the levels of circulating T cells [5] and members of the neutrophil degranulation network are regarded as a possible leukemia-associated antigen (proteinase 3, PRTN3) and as a regulator of antileukemic immune reactivity (major histocompatibility complex, class I, B; HLA-B).
PMC8125016	D06000	A gene expression study of 28 responders and non-responders to AML-stabilizing treatment ATRA/VP identified subsets of differentially expressed genes involved in transcriptional regulation (i.e., DNA/RNA binding proteins, transcription factors and nucleases), protein degradation/activation/modulation and metabolism [30] (data available at the Gene Expression Omnibus data repository with accession code GSE106096).
PMC8125016	D10004	Our observations suggest that the DNA methylation status is not decisive for the effect of our present strategy of epigenetic targeting in the treatment of human AML and DNA methylation profiling cannot be used to predict the response to ATRA/VP therapy.
PMC8125016	I02000	Protein acetylation is regulated by the balance between histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs)
PMC8125016	I02002	The HDAC enzymes are grouped into Class I (HDAC 1/2/3/8), class II (HDAC 4/5/6/7/9/10), class III (the sirtuins SIRT1-7) and Class IV (only HDAC11)
PMC8125016	I02004	HDAC inhibitors alter the acetylation of several proteins, including histones, causing increased gene transcription [19,20].
PMC8125016	I02005	VP is a branched short-chain fatty acid that targets two of the four classes of HDACs: Class I, subclasses Ia and Ib; and Class II, subclass IIa
PMC8125016	I02007	However, the exceptions are HDAC 9/11, which are activated and HDAC 6/8/10, that do not seem to be affected by VP [18,21,22].
PMC8125016	I02008	Several other HDAC inhibitors are also in clinical trials; the inhibitory profile varies between individual inhibitors but the inhibition of Class I and Class II HDACs is common both for VP, vorinostat, belinostat and panobinostat [18].
PMC8125016	R05005	The systemic lupus erythematosus Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway, which represents proteins involved in the production of IgG autoantibodies that are specific for self-antigens such as DNA or nuclear proteins, was also enriched in the PRE-R patient group.
PMC8125016	R05006	Identified proteins belonging to this pathway are ELANE, cathepsin G (CTSG), H2BC21, H2A.Z variant histone 2 (H2AZ2) and H2B clustered histone 14 (H2BC14).
PMC8125016	R06000	In contrast, levels of proteins involved in processes such as hematopoietic or lymphoid organ development (e.g., sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase 1, SGPL1; SBDS ribosome maturation factor, SBDS), transcription by RNA polymerase II and cell death were higher in PRE-NR patients (Figure 2b, bottom plot; Table 2).
PMC8125016	R11002	A sequence logo of the amino acid sequence windows surrounding the phosphorylation sites of the splicing factor network (Figure S1) identified the SP and the SXR/K motifs for mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and protein kinase C delta/protein kinase cAMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha PRKCD/PRKACA, respectively, although RNA polymerase II subunit A (POLR2A) S1920 and SRSF11 S207 are phosphorylated by cyclin dependent kinase (CDK)1 and CDK2, respectively [46].
PMC8125016	R11003	The phosphorylation of RPS6 at S236 by several members of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase family (i.e., RPS6KA1, RPS6KA3 or RPS6KB1) facilitates the assembly of the translation preinitiation complex [57] whereas polo like kinase 1 (PLK1) phosphorylation at RIOK2 S380 regulates mitotic progression [58].
PMC8125016	R11004	Four phosphoproteins belonging to the apoptotic execution phase Reactome pathway II showed higher phosphorylation in PRE-R than in PRE-NR patients.
PMC8125016	R11005	The residue S18 is part of one of the five (S/T)P(K/A)K motifs found in the H1.5 linker histone, cluster member (H1-5) sequence which becomes phosphorylated, possibly by CDKs, during chromatin decondensation [59].
PMC8125016	R11006	Clusters consisted of components of the histone deacetylation complex (i.e., nuclear receptor corepressor 1 and 2, NCOR1/2), and of RNA synthesis/elongation were observed in diseases of signal transduction and TP53 regulates transcription of DNA repair genes enriched Reactome pathways III and IV, respectively.
PMC8125016	R13000	The F-actin depolymerizing activity of CFL1 is inactivated by phosphorylation on S3 by NIK related kinase (NRK)/NIK-like embryo-specific kinase (NESK), testis associated actin remodeling kinase 1 (TESK1), protein kinase D1 (PRKD1) and LIM domain kinase 1/2 (LIMK1/LIMK2)
PMC8125016	R13002	Interestingly, some of these kinases were predicted to be activated in the PRE-R group by kinase–substrate enrichment analysis (KSEA) (Figure 3e, see results below).
PMC8125016	R16000	In order to determine whether the protein phosphorylation levels were due to changes in protein abundance or to kinase activation, we investigated the expression of 85 phosphoproteins to the 107 differentially regulated phosphosites.
PMC8125016	R17000	To identify protein kinases differentially activated in the PRE-R and PRE-NR groups, we performed phosphorylation site motif analysis (IceLogo)
PMC8125016	R17002	We found basophilic RXXpS/pT and RPPS motifs characteristics of PRKCA/PRKCD and dual specificity tyrosine phosphorylation regulated kinase 2 (DYRK2), respectively, in PRE-R patient samples when compared to the PRE-NR group (Figure 3d).
PMC8125016	R17003	Furthermore, the KSEA [44,45], which is based on phosphorylation FCs to estimate kinase’s activity, confirmed the higher activity of these kinases together with LIMK1/2 and CDK2 in the PRE-R group (Figure 3e).
PMC8125016	R18000	CDK2 appeared to phosphorylate a large number of phosphosites in this dataset according to the KSEA search (e.g., PTPN2 S304, POLR2A S1920; stathmin 1, STMN1 S25, SRSF11 S207 and lamin A/C, LMNA S392).
PMC8125016	R18001	Only two kinases, protein kinase cGMP-dependent 2 (PRKG2) and microtubule affinity regulating kinase 1 (MARK1) involved in the activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases in osteoblasts and cell polarity, respectively [64,65], were predicted to be more active in the PRE-NR group.
PMC8125016	R18002	The prediction of phosphorylation sites by a novel deep learning architecture based on multi-layer convolution neural networks (i.e., DeepPhos) installed in the piNET web platform [48,49] confirmed the higher number of activated kinases on substrates more phosphorylated in PRE-R patients when compared with the PRE-NR group (Figure S3) as previously observed in the KSEA analysis.
PMC8125016	R18003	Among them, CDK1/2, MAPK4 (displayed as ERK1 in the figure) and PRKCD were again predicted to be more activated in the PRE-R group.
PMC8125016	R19000	The search of our phosphosite dataset by the kinase activation loop tool (see Materials and Methods) did not find any phosphorylated residue in the domain activation loops.
PMC8125016	R19001	However, we identified two kinases (in addition to the RIOK2 identified previously), CDK13 and pre-mRNA processing factor 4B (PRPF4B) more phosphorylated at S395 and S397 in PRE-NR and at S578 and S580 in PRE-R patients, respectively.
PMC8125016	R29001	Clusters corresponding to ten different response patterns were identified in the responder group; two of them with low site-specific phosphorylation at 8D (cluster 1–4) were enriched with RNA processing, mRNA splicing, via spliceosome (e.g., SRRM1/2; RNA binding motif protein 15, RBM15; serine and arginine rich splicing factor 2, SRSF2) and nuclear speck (e.g., SRSF1; RB binding protein 6, ubiquitin ligase, RBBP6) GO terms whereas clusters with high site-specific phosphorylation at 8D (cluster 5–7) were enriched with Rho GTPase binding, cytoplasmic mRNA processing body assembly and actin filament binding (Figure 6a, right plot).
PMC8125016	R29002	Clusters with high and low site-specific phosphorylation at 3D were enriched with the negative regulation of vasculature development/RNA polymerase I core binding (e.g., PML nuclear body scaffold, PML; programmed cell death 4, PDCD4; nucleolar and coiled-body phosphoprotein 1, NOLC1) and cyclin/CDK positive transcription elongation (i.e., RB transcriptional corepressor 1, RB1; CDK12) GO terms, respectively.
PMC8125016	R31000	To identify protein kinases differentially activated in the temporal pair-wise comparisons we performed phosphorylation site motif analysis with WebLogo [43].
PMC8125016	R31001	We found the basophilic R/KXpS/pT and the SP motif characteristics of PRKCA/PRKCD and MAPK3/1, respectively, in pre-treatment patient samples when compared to the 3D group (Figure 6c, left plot).
PMC8125016	R31002	Furthermore, the basophilic RRRSXpS/pT, the SP and the acidic SXD/ED/E motif characteristics of AKT serine/threonine kinase 1 (AKT1), MAPK3/1 and casein kinase 2 alpha 1 (CSNK2A1), respectively, were observed in the 8D when compared to the pre-treatment group (Figure 6c, middle plot).
PMC8125016	R32000	To briefly summarize the important observations from this part of our study, we observed again that the triple combination altered the phosphorylation of proteins, especially those involved in the regulation of translation/transcription/RNA metabolism, but additional effects were also observed for cytoskeletal/actin proteins and Rho GTPase binding.
PMC8125016	R33001	Clusters with an increasing temporal phosphorylation profiling (clusters 1 and 8), i.e., from PRE to 8D, in the non-responder phosphoproteome were enriched with CDK activity (e.g., CDK1, CDK2, CDK11B, CDK12) and RNA splicing (e.g., DEAH-box helicase 16, DHX16) whereas clusters with a decreasing temporal phosphorylation profiling (clusters 2 and 5) were enriched with G-protein coupled receptor signaling pathway (e.g., IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 2, IGGAP2; Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor 7, ARHGEF7) and RNA polymerase II transcription factor activity (e.g., high mobility group protein HMG-I/HMG-Y and HMGA1) GO terms (Figure 7a, right plot).
PMC8125016	R34000	Clusters with the highest protein phosphorylation at 3D (cluster 3, 4 and 6) were enriched with RNA splicing, protein–DNA complex assembly (e.g., H1.4 linker histone, cluster member, H1-4; heterochromatin protein 1 binding protein 3, HP1BP3; remodeling and spacing factor 1, Rsf-1, RSF1) and the sites of the DNA damage (e.g., replication timing regulatory factor 1, RIF1) GO terms, whereas clusters with the lowest protein phosphorylation at 3D (clusters 7, 9 and 10) were enriched with a negative regulation of the cellular catabolic process (e.g., PML, dyskerin pseudouridine synthase 1, DKC1), nuclear chromosome, telomeric region and the negative regulation of T cell activation (e.g., CD74 molecule, CD74; sialophorin, SPN) when compared to pre-treatment and 8D conditions.
PMC8125016	R36000	The analysis of kinase substrates using the WebLogo tool found an enrichment of basophilic R/KXpS/pT and the SP motif characteristics of PRKCA/PRKCD and MAPK3/1, respectively, in the 3D-NR and 8D-NR patient samples when compared to the pre-treatment group (Figure 7c, left and middle plot).
PMC8125016	R36001	The acidic SXD/ED/E kinase motif of CSNK2A1 was clearly observed in the 8D-NR when compared to the 3D-NR group (Figure 7c, right plot).
PMC8125016	R37000	Taken together, the non-responder group differed from the responders both with regard to the phosphorylation events on the actin/cytoskeleton but also with regard to transcriptional regulation and GTPase/G-protein coupled signaling.
PMC8396559	D02004	L-PGDS is expressed in various tissues, such as the brain, retina, cochlea, and male reproductive organs, and it is found in different biological fluids, such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), ascites, seminal plasma, serum, urine, and amniotic fluid.
PMC8396559	D02005	Alongside hematopoietic-type PGDS (H-PGDS), L-PGDS is related to a group of prostaglandin D synthases (PGDS) responsible for converting PGH2 to PGD2 [57], which is involved in a variety of central nervous system (CNS) functions, such as sedation, nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and PGD2-allodynia.
PMC8396559	D02006	In addition to synthesizing PGD2, a potent endogenous nociceptive modulator [58] within the cells, in the extracellular space and body fluids L-PGDS binds various small nonsubstrate lipophilic molecules such as retinal, retinoic acid [59], bilirubin, biliverdin [60], gangliosides [61], amyloid β peptides [62].
PMC8396559	D05000	Alpha-1 antitrypsin (A1AT), also known as alpha-1 proteinase inhibitor, is an acute phase reactant and serine protease inhibitor (serpin) whose targets are elastase, plasmin, thrombin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasminogen activator, and is mostly produced in the liver and expressed by hepatocytes [76].
PMC8396559	D13000	Inter-alpha-trypsin heavy chain H4 (ITIH4) is a liver-produced glycoprotein belonging to the liver-restricted serine protease inhibitor family.
PMC8396559	D15000	Nonsecretory ribonuclease (RNAS2) is a pyrimidine specific nuclease with a slight preference for cytotoxin and helminthotoxin.
PMC8396559	R00001	Thus, Bellei et al. (2017) demonstrated overexpressed serum proteins, particularly alpha-1-macroglobulin (A1MG), vitamin D-binding protein (VDBP), apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1), apolipoprotein E (APOE), prostaglandin-H2-D-isomerase (PTGDS), transthyretin (TTR), which can be involved in the expression or mediation of chronic pain, on a rat model after chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve [24].
PMC8396559	R01001	Few studies have shown the potential biomarkers of headache chronicity caused by medication overuse, such as SNVs of the angiotensin-converting enzyme, brain-derived neurotropic factor, catechol-O-methyltransferase genes, altered neurotransmitters metabolism, neurophysiological and neuroimaging changes [27].
PMC8396559	R02000	Thus, Pellesi et al. (2019) showed the overexpression of lipocalin-type prostaglandin D2 synthase (L-PGDS) in the serum of MOH patients compared to healthy controls (219.2 ± 58.2 vs. 188.7 ± 39.2 ng/mL, p = 0.0038) and a not significant increase of apolipoprotein A1 (APOA1) (49.8 ± 23.7 vs. 46.9 ± 17.5 μg/mL, p = 0.546).
PMC92037	D03006	Preliminary studies involving 13C-labeled acetate suggest that appreciable butyrate may be derived from exogenous acetate in mixed fecal fermentations (S. H. Duncan et al., unpublished data).
PMC92614	M04000	PCRs were performed using a Taq DNA polymerase kit from Life Technologies (Gaithersburg, Md.).
PMC92614	M04001	The reaction mixture consisted of 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.4), 50 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), a 0.2 μM concentration of each primer, 1.25 U of Taq polymerase, and 1 μl of appropriately diluted template DNA in a final volume of 50 μl.
PMC92614	M04002	In PCR with primers 7-f and 1510-r, the dNTP concentration was increased to 0.3 mM and the amount of Taq polymerase was increased to 1.5 U.
PMC92614	M05000	RT-PCR was performed with the Geneamp Thermostable rTth Reverse Transcriptase RNA PCR kit (Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, Conn.).
PMC92614	M05001	Reverse transcription reaction mixtures (10 μl) consisted of 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 90 mM KCl, 1 mM MnCl2, 0.25 mM dNTP, 0.75 μM primer 1401-r, 1.25 U of recombinant Tth DNA polymerase, and 1 μl of appropriately diluted RNA.
PMC92614	M09005	In addition to the comparison with sequences in the databases, sequences of fecal clones were compared to the B. adolescentis E-981074T sequences determined in this study, because the B. adolescentis 16S rDNA sequence deposited in the GenBank appears to contain many ambiguous bases.
